{"abstract": "Hidden Markov models (HMMs) have proven to be one of the most widely used tools for learning probabilistic models of time series data. In an HMM, information about the past is conveyed through a single discrete variable\u2014the hidden state. We discuss a generalization of HMMs in which this state is factored into multiple state variables and is therefore represented in a distributed manner. We describe an exact algorithm for inferring the posterior probabilities of the hidden state variables given the observations, and relate it to the forward\u2013backward algorithm for HMMs and to algorithms for more general graphical models. Due to the combinatorial nature of the hidden state representation, this exact algorithm is intractable. As in other intractable systems, approximate inference can be carried out using Gibbs sampling or variational methods. Within the variational framework, we present a structured approximation in which the the state variables are decoupled, yielding a tractable algorithm for learning the parameters of the model. Empirical comparisons suggest that these approximations are efficient and provide accurate alternatives to the exact methods. Finally, we use the structured approximation to model Bach\u2018s chorales and show that factorial HMMs can capture statistical structure in this data set which an unconstrained HMM cannot.", "authors": ["Zoubin Ghahramani", "Michael I.

{"abstract": "We present a formal system to reason about and specify the behavior of multiple intelligent artificial agents. Essentially, each agent can perform certain actions, and it may possess a variety of information in order to reason about its and other agent's actions. Thus, our KARO-framework tries to deal formally with the notion of Knowledge, possessed by the agents, and their possible execution of actions. In particular, each agent may reason about its \u2014or, alternatively, other's\u2014 Abilities to perform certain actions, the possible Results of such an execution and the availability of the Opportunities to take a particular action. Formally, we combine dynamic and epistemic logic into one modal system, and add the notion of ability to it. We demonstrate that there are several options to define the ability to perform a sequentially composed action, and we outline several properties under two alternative choices. Also, the agents' views on the correctness and feasibility of their plans are highlighted. Finally, the complications in the completeness proof for both systems indicate that the presence of abilities in the logic makes the use of infinite proof rules useful, if not inevitable.", "authors": ["B. van Linder", "W. van der Hoek", "J.-J.

{"abstract": "Many applications demand availability. Unfortunately, software failures greatly reduce system availability. Prior work on surviving software failures suffers from one or more of the following limitations: Required application restructuring, inability to address deterministic software bugs, unsafe speculation on program execution, and long recovery time.This paper proposes an innovative  safe  technique, called Rx, which can quickly recover programs from many types of software bugs, both deterministic and non-deterministic. Our idea, inspired from allergy treatment in real life, is to rollback the program to a recent checkpoint upon a software failure, and then to re-execute the program in a  modified  environment. We base this idea on the observation that many bugs are correlated with the execution environment, and therefore can be avoided by removing the \"allergen\" from the environment. Rx requires few to no modifications to applications and provides programmers with additional feedback for bug diagnosis.We have implemented RX on Linux. Our experiments with four server applications that contain six bugs of various types show that RX can survive all the six software failures and provide transparent fast recovery within 0.017-0.16 seconds, 21-53 times faster than the whole program restart approach for all but one case (CVS). In contrast, the two tested alternatives, a whole program restart approach and a simple rollback and re-execution without environmental changes, cannot successfully recover the three servers (Squid, Apache, and CVS) that contain deterministic bugs, and have only a 40% recovery rate for the server (MySQL) that contains a non-deterministic concurrency bug. Additionally, RX's checkpointing system is lightweight, imposing small time and space overheads.", "authors": ["Feng Qin", "Joseph Tucek", "Jagadeesan Sundaresan", "Yuanyuan Zhou"], "n_citation": 360, "references": ["0778e9dd-a9b4-467d-ac47-b16305f0be3c", "08026dbe-0e47-42c8-aa05-1e62a2f599f5", "083d3b9c-7e61-4bdc-83ca-748630f86c1c", "08de31d5-74cd-4196-b2e4-3a089ed2968a", "0abf39d4-3e1f-4f9c-af3e-496278cfa17b", "101c9262-2e10-4f63-befd-38511b8c3dc6", "119162d6-0403-4980-8096-f6fa5d9fc228", "11f52fe3-4eca-4818-9bcf-9e24cdc76fb5", "147e3ec5-305c-45a9-aa4d-b72e02d6b0d3", "167a4b00-c2bb-489d-86f1-ab3831833516", "1bb310d0-09ce-488b-bf0f-720907ce7b31", "1dc60daa-d7b1-4931-9cc1-23a77041f02c", "1fc12bfd-88e6-42db-b797-f8ed4e747a26", "257936d0-3daa-4515-a1d6-ec8a98f537fb", "25fc82ab-23d8-49bf-89bf-778b9c72d4d3", "2c130954-1b7f-47e0-8bf1-f5a8c9c1262a", "2d2c49e5-99ac-462b-842e-6143a49f61cd", "416689be-ec06-46cc-96c4-43670338a935", "58f68055-36b0-41cc-bf97-958c5de5c849", "5aa9499d-836a-4b54-9db7-f67a6d849dfa", "5afceaf5-ed1d-413e-88c4-2670b3468ad7", "62c821f3-e90d-4f47-8ccc-194eef36b7cc", "65c674fe-fc63-4ba0-a6c9-6a0153454889", "6615ef10-1218-474c-9ba3-96dcf6358a26", "673a52b1-146d-4c19-af5e-a1d479dadb29", "6a99856e-831c-4bab-b4b9-1a08836a3f75", "6dbca63e-bea1-407c-ae48-7c4d6b2a4c6c", "70b37df6-1eb9-4781-b2d8-8abc6468e6fb", "7d858c10-2f60-4a71-b51c-be58827083d8", "89fe661e-83a3-4fd1-83db-075620e034a8", "8ec678d3-4fc6-4c88-9d36-21a57b3fa6ab", "8f3d6626-1521-4d8a-9162-ebfa360bf943", "9787425d-94d5-4529-8eb2-c904dd57ce69", "9dddf29d-dcfe-4a5c-85cc-6a7b6b2d91b4", "a3ae983a-a5b1-4a66-85c4-f7eaba90def6", "ad4eff53-a46e-4c95-b265-4f2e8db755ad", "b96f40e1-8b81-469f-b08a-31f1e7a3319d", "bd8b85c4-68d6-4019-bf30-2c5f9f52c148", "c5ab640d-0872-46f8-bf53-e890c295adeb", "c7f0ccf6-296a-4ce8-987b-1abc56a41c3f", "ca491598-3541-48e9-a56a-7a1506d1f7a0", "cb9b8af2-96a8-44a0-891b-ae1b99a50073", "cbb71ab1-9040-4caf-8e51-d05cf46ebde7", "cfe5590e-dd0a-417b-a008-b5c4ce8a63e2", "d8c052c9-2e62-46f2-a0fa-b4eb3aea0dfe", "dc9b5e57-3f4a-41f2-a150-c1cc26fb4400", "dcc54817-f52a-483b-9982-4a6cd8109e74", "e4865fbd-5e52-487f-8103-4952097473e4", "ebf41a8a-bb4a-4baf-990d-c743e6d524e8", "fdf5c2b3-553a-4489-b920-c6a2b1d96818", "ffe5f478-c303-428b-bb8d-251e27638f87"], "title": "Rx: treating bugs as allergies---a safe method to survive software failures", "venue": "symposium on operating systems principles", "year": 2005, "id": "308d5af9-fcd6-4645-b834-4a3148de4700"}

{"abstract": "Developing computing applications that can match a set of evolving requirements requires an understanding of the conceptual fitness of these applications relative to the domains they purport to serve. We present the computing ecosystem framework with its associated concepts, use niches, use potential, and activation potential. We show how the ecosystem framework allows us to characterize the usefulness of an application through the concept of fitness. We propose a method for measuring the fitness of an application using a metric called ontological coverage.   We first use a technique called ontological excavation that identifies the user-visible concepts from applications and models them in an ontology. We then use a set of use cases to develop a use case silhouette on the ontology that allows us to measure the ontological coverage of an application as an initial approximation of fitness to a use niche.

{"abstract": "In cloud computing, stakeholders deploy and run their software applications on a sophisticated infrastructure that is owned and managed by third-party providers. The ability of a given cloud infrastructure to effectively re-allocate resources to applications is referred to as elasticity. To enable elasticity, programmers study the behavior of applications and write scripts that guide the cloud to provision resources for these applications. This is an imprecise, laborious, manual and expensive approach that drastically increases the cost of application deployment and maintenance in the cloud. We propose an approach, coined as Provisioning Resources with Experimental SofTware mOdeling (PRESTO), to automatically learn behavioral models of software applications during performance testing in order to recommend programmers how to improve provisioning strategies that guide the cloud to (de)allocate resources to these applications. We applied PRESTO to two software applications and our experiments demonstrate that with PRESTO programmers can create rules for provisioning resources with a high degree of precision when the performance is about to worsen, so that the applications maintain their throughputs at the desired level.", "authors": ["Mark Grechanik", "Qi Luo", "Denys Poshyvanyk", "Adam A.

The context-awareness has been carried out by unsupervised learning, Fuzzy ART. Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to explore the most effective action configuration for each identified context. The knowledge of the individual context and its associated chromosomes representing optimal action configurations is accumulated and stored in the context knowledge base. Once the context knowledge is constructed, the system can adapt to varying environment in real-time. The framework of CAES has been tested in the area of intelligent vision application where most approaches show vulnerability under dynamically changing environments.

{"abstract": "We present a new technique for the optimization of (partially) bound queries over disjunctive datalog programs. The technique exploits the propagation of query bindings, and extends the Magic-Set optimization technique (originally defined for non-disjunctive programs) to the disjunctive case, substantially improving on previously defined approaches. Magic-Set-transformed disjunctive programs frequently contain redundant rules. We tackle this problem and propose a method for preventing the generation of such superfluous rules during the Magic-Set transformation. In addition, we provide an efficient heuristic method for the identification of redundant rules, which can be applied in general, even if Magic-Sets are not used. We implement all proposed methods in the DLV system - the state-of-the-art implementation of disjunctive datalog - and perform some experiments. The experimental results confirm the usefulness of Magic-Sets for disjunctive datalog, and they highlight the computational gain obtained by our method, which out-performs significantly the previously proposed Magic-Set method for disjunctive datalog programs.", "authors": ["Chiara Cumbo", "Wolfgang Faber", "Gianluigi Greco", "Nicola Leone"], "n_citation": 62, "references": ["185f7384-2349-4b98-9c48-c366b846689a", "1c59442a-9530-4717-9f91-aaee3e7a70db", "1fa13d51-9cc3-45f5-a0e9-89eb572a80d6", "41b890e0-88af-4f9a-9d1d-f768d6bcc248", "597d5892-3dad-4369-883f-f61254d0b8b7", "83cffa4d-7bb2-42ba-b583-9c745778b192", "88ae3b67-86c1-4fa5-b195-0404604c58e2", "a45673fd-f791-4e6c-9580-8898c7f76100", "b2eddbc1-021d-41cb-aa50-025eb10ed5c2", "c137d26f-7be5-426c-9454-a58f5a513dc0", "c404c1bf-4992-42d3-a280-ed6227964e4f", "c74f2dc5-6158-495d-90e3-cefd08b2eac5", "d0adc46e-d20b-429c-a237-477cbf2d8286", "db658327-1f48-4f80-8f7d-09d88096f297", "fdaab34e-df75-4770-92d7-f8268157f827"], "title": "Enhancing the Magic-Set Method for Disjunctive Datalog Programs", "venue": "international conference on logic programming", "year": 2004, "id": "64ee93d3-2683-4e8b-94cd-36a916aa73d7"}
{"abstract": "Given that e-catalogs are often autonomous and heterogeneous, effectively integrating and querying them is a delicate and time-consuming task. More importantly, the number of e-catalogs to be integrated and queried may be large and continuously changing. Conventional approaches where the development of an integrated e-catalog requires the understanding of each of the underlying catalog are inappropriate. In this paper, we use the concept of e-catalog communities and peer relationships among them to facilitate the querying of a potentially large number of dynamic e-catalogs.

{"abstract": "Nowadays, software has become a complex piece of work that may be beyond our control. Understanding how software evolves over time plays an important role in controlling software development processes. Recently, a few researchers found the quantitative evidence of structural duplication in software systems or web applications, which is similar to the evolutionary trend found in biological systems. To investigate the principles or rules of software evolution, we introduce the relevant theories and methods of complex networks into structural evolution and change of software systems. According to the results of our experiment on network motifs, we find that the stability of a motif shows positive correlation with its abundance and a motif with high Z score tends to have stable structure. These findings imply that the evolution of software systems is based on functional cloning as well as structural duplication and tends to be structurally stable. So, the work presented in this paper will be useful for the analysis of structural changes of software systems in reverse engineering.", "authors": ["Yutao Ma", "Keqing He", "Jing Liu"], "n_citation": 21, "references": ["02e0342a-33d3-4d3f-9f1d-b14081edbc39", "0690db41-a8e5-437e-b6bc-77b569d4d9d7", "06ddd6e1-3ccb-43b8-acca-9357ef232fdf", "2434c52f-c0e1-49aa-8039-eedd0dfd8b92", "26db4152-3ccf-4b7a-9b23-fc69cb5d220b", "3fe2792a-ea49-4d6e-8b83-6d09f4df6471", "8dc3fccd-b00a-4b53-9e82-dd95515aa478", "a64aae5a-757b-470a-8af7-7ac8af584216", "cff1dd6c-5cc0-43e2-abbc-f9ecc50add0d", "e2401f1f-2679-4cba-8c2f-aaf9027dc558", "e59abdec-eeb8-4966-9e89-a48d862c23a4"], "title": "Network Motifs in Object-Oriented Software Systems", "venue": "arXiv: Software Engineering", "year": 2008, "id": "98b6802e-093c-46b8-99d2-4f63e9387259"}

{"abstract": "Fault based testing is a technique for choosing test cases to reveal certain classes of faults. Due to limited resources and time, testing professionals use their personal experience to (1) \"guess\" which fault classes are most likely to be present and, then, (2) select appropriate testing methods to reveal such fault classes. The quality of the software depends on whether they can make a good \"guess\" about the type of faults present and then choose the right testing methods to reveal those faults. However, there is little empirical evidence available in the open literature to support these intuitions. For example, there is no empirical evidence about which types of faults are most commonly made by software developers. By examining the source code changes when faults were fixed in seven open source software artifacts, we propose to classify bug fix patterns into fault classes, and recorded the relative frequencies of those fault classes.

{"abstract": "Highly complex enterprise software packages have become a standard way of competing in many industries. By the late 1990s, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems had enabled Fortune 500 firms to present one face to their customers via integrated cross-functional business processes, centralized databases, and point-and-click access to real-time operational data across the business. Today, enterprise systems for supply chain management (SCM) and customer relationship management (CRM) are following in the steps of ERP, and, in many cases, providing a foundation for e-business. Supplier relationship management systems are on the horizon. Based on our ERP research, we have identified five factors for successful implementation: (1) top management is engaged in the project, not just involved; (2) project leaders are veterans, and team members are decision makers; (3) third parties fill gaps in expertise and transfer their knowledge; (4) change management goes hand-in-hand with project planning; (5) A satisficing mindset prevails. Furthermore, we found that a projects position on the maturity curve (early adopter, early majority, or late majority) can influence the implementation route. These five success factors and three maturity curve positions are illustrated in three anonymous cases. The result is lessons for managing the complexities of the next wave of enterprise systems.", "authors": ["Carol V.

{"abstract": "To cope with resource constraints in multitasking control systems, feedback scheduling is emerging as an important technique for integrating control and scheduling. The ability of neural networks (NNs) as good and robust nonlinear function approximators, reducing the computation time as compared against algorithmic solutions, suggests applying them to the feedback scheduling problem. A novel, simple and intelligent feedback scheduler is presented using a feedforward NN. The algorithmic optimizer is utilized as a teacher to generate data samples for NN training. The role of the NN based feedback scheduler is to provide a good approximation to the optimal solution and online adjust the sampling period of each control task so that the overall system performance is maximized in the face of workload variations. The performance of the NN approach is evaluated through co-simulations of the scheduler, controllers and process dynamics.", "authors": ["Feng Xia", "Youxian Sun"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["2182afec-22ec-472e-b877-f9b6215910a9", "b393bf99-e40c-4bad-8d40-fa7c6f0e211b", "c7e02d38-901f-40a1-9a92-a7bd5c655b56", "eb7048c3-4d16-4b09-89f7-5b72e78b2bb0"], "title": "Neural network based feedback scheduling of multitasking control systems", "venue": "", "year": 2005, "id": "204f4491-7cef-4712-9b1f-e622d51c71d1"}

Scenario describe how system components, the environment and users work concurrently and interact in order to provide system level functionality.

However, although it is possible to build a set of components such that each component behaves in accordance with the set of scenarios, their composition may not provide the required system behaviour. Implied scenarios may appear as a result of unexpected component interaction.

It exploits the technological flexibility of software applications to enable these actors to change usages and configurations. Taking the case of the BSCWeasel groupware, we demonstrate how an appropriation infrastructure can be realized.

{"abstract": "Bidirectional transformation  is a pair of transformations: a  view function  and a  backward transformation . A view function maps one data structure called source onto another called view. The corresponding backward transformation reflects changes in the view to the source. Its practically useful applications include replicated data synchronization, presentation-oriented editor development, tracing software development, and view updating in the database community. However, developing a bidirectional transformation is hard, because one has to give two mappings that satisfy the bidirectional properties for system consistency.   In this paper, we propose a new framework for bidirectionalization that can automatically generate a useful backward transformation from a view function while guaranteeing that the two transformations satisfy the bidirectional properties. Our framework is based on two known approaches to bidirectionalization, namely the constant complement approach from the database community and the combinator approach from the programming language community, but it has three new features: (1) unlike the constant complement approach, it can deal with transformations between algebraic data structures rather than just tables; (2) unlike the combinator approach, in which primitive bidirectional transformations have to be explicitly given, it can derive them automatically; (3) it generates a view update checker to validate updates on views, which has not been well addressed so far. The new framework has been implemented and the experimental results show that our framework has promise.", "authors": ["Kazutaka Matsuda", "Zhenjiang Hu", "Keisuke Nakano", "Makoto Hamana", "Masato Takeichi"], "n_citation": 119, "references": ["12d84dd3-23da-47fa-af68-e71d1d37576f", "2a230c9d-f74c-488b-819c-e9d87396678d", "33ce07dd-9c31-41cd-b7d4-a1b01086ebf8", "3c0b0d41-1969-4386-87bf-a9999feb5e2a", "40b5887a-c1a2-4267-a2ee-903c391168cc", "64868d89-e748-48a0-b13d-8c9ce712ad02", "7ccba7ef-b7a5-46da-bae3-70649a139230", "94d8f424-a1c4-4f00-934c-6cfbc9d466ba", "ae83289f-8990-49fb-a842-2839ff03e16b", "b6703a88-6722-46d8-9f21-eed5f20dabe4", "d521a867-1b72-434b-ab19-abfa5a58c5f2"], "title": "Bidirectionalization transformation based on automatic derivation of view complement functions", "venue": "international conference on functional programming", "year": 2007, "id": "55fd81ff-fef2-44c9-8cec-d95fccdad41f"}
{"abstract": "Probabilistic modeling is important for random distributed algorithms, bio-systems or decision processes. Probabilistic model checking is a systematic way of analyzing finite-state probabilistic models. Existing probabilistic model checkers have been designed for simple systems without hierarchy. In this paper, we extend the PAT toolkit to support probabilistic model checking of hierarchical complex systems. We propose to use PCSP#, a combination of Hoare's CSP with data and probability, to model such systems. In addition to temporal logic, we allow complex safety properties to be specified by non-probabilistic PCSP# model. Validity of the properties (with probability) is established by refinement checking. Furthermore, we show that refinement checking can be applied to verify probabilistic systems against safety/co-safety temporal logic properties efficiently. We demonstrate the usability and scalability of the extended PAT checker via automated verification of benchmark systems and comparison with state-of-art probabilistic model checkers.", "authors": ["Jun Sun", "Songzheng Song", "Yang Liu"], "n_citation": 41, "references": ["21c3bc2c-4924-4051-99af-602c88598bf0", "22ddf557-42ea-4cf4-a982-4738f0ede296", "252b9e3e-4e30-426b-b4fc-2859b4e5503c", "28b15182-9b07-41ad-b38f-dcf0a7ba85ca", "32797d89-028d-42ca-aa08-2187d9739fe8", "46583b7d-c474-41ff-a85c-df1db88e7860", "46ce7e0c-564f-4a02-b8ca-db8a2d151f4b", "481608af-5c19-4dab-9d13-c842df673984", "518dde83-aaaf-4865-a57f-cb60b534a860", "5d641881-20b8-492f-b025-6fcf74eb7f41", "5d93cf8b-dc24-4880-ac23-f06fa52ee4b3", "6e12c5c0-acce-4a52-a59c-f7a912731d92", "72831a2e-01f6-4f2f-baae-f96856a4fc52", "73ce5472-9167-49ba-a047-5fc23c0412df", "74e3fd8b-f955-4fde-aad8-0a705f05e27e", "76644d5c-a90b-4ec3-80c4-afd8ebe7eb41", "79378db1-ba0a-4f17-b51c-ade43c21f917", "862c4d86-8f28-41c3-a1e8-11a645daba3d", "8e90a9e5-e8dc-4f46-827a-9bc757e3aa53", "9849d9c4-a97f-452f-882c-42a8c6cab0b5", "b23bf8d3-83da-46da-8b17-0a7d2433518b", "b55768f0-7632-4f8e-8049-73d377a293d6", "befa07ec-ea48-4165-bd05-2eae047f27ad", "e4f43f27-9313-43da-a96c-f8548a27354f", "f33cd1a3-2015-49c8-9aaa-012b3e1cff12"], "title": "Model checking hierarchical probabilistic systems", "venue": "international conference on formal engineering methods", "year": 2010, "id": "6d0eb483-0fdc-4df7-b741-fe5f08ce68b2"}

{"abstract": "Distributed coding at the hidden layer of a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) endows the network with memory compression and noise tolerance capabilities. However, an MLP typically requires slow off-line learning to avoid catastrophic forgetting in an open input environment. An adaptive resonance theory (ART) model is designed to guarantee stable memories even with fast on-line learning. However, ART stability typically requires winner-take-all coding, which may cause category proliferation in a noisy input environment. Distributed ARTMAP (dARTMAP) seeks to combine the computational advantages of MLP and ART systems in a real-time neural network for supervised learning. An implementation algorithm here describes one class of dARTMAP networks. This system incorporates elements of the unsupervised dART model, as well as new features, including a content-addressable memory (CAM) rule for improved contrast control at the coding field. A dARTMAP system reduces to fuzzy ARTMAP when coding is winner-take-all.

{"abstract": "The goal of this paper is event detection and recounting using a representation of concept detector scores. Different from existing work, which encodes videos by averaging concept scores over all frames, we propose to encode videos using fragments that are discriminatively learned per event. Our  bag-of-fragments  split a video into semantically coherent fragment proposals. From training video proposals we show how to select the most discriminative fragment for an event. An encoding of a video is in turn generated by matching and pooling these discriminative fragments to the fragment proposals of the video. The bag-of-fragments forms an effective encoding for event detection and is able to provide a precise temporally localized event recounting. Furthermore, we show how bag-of-fragments can be extended to deal with irrelevant concepts in the event recounting. Experiments on challenging web videos show that i) our modest number of fragment proposals give a high sub-event recall, ii) bag-of-fragments is complementary to global averaging and provides better event detection, iii) bag-of-fragments with concept filtering yields a desirable event recounting.

{"abstract": "The ability to find tables and extract information from them is a necessary component of data mining, question answering, and other information retrieval tasks. Documents often contain tables in order to communicate densely packed, multi-dimensional information.

This paper presents the use of conditional random fields (CRFs) for table extraction, and compares them with hidden Markov models (HMMs). Unlike HMMs, CRFs support the use of many rich and overlapping layout and language features, and as a result, they perform significantly better. We show experimental results on plain-text government statistical reports in which tables are located with 92% F1, and their constituent lines are classified into 12 table-related categories with 94% accuracy.

By way of illustration, the actions of a collection of robots are controlled by a wireless system that connects a web agent (called a Guide Agent or GA) written in Java and pairs of Radio Packet Controller (RPCs) modules (one attached to a workstation and a second RPC on board a robot). The web GA analyzes robot sensors signals, communicates robot movement commands and assists other web agents in updating some parts of a web page that implements a real-time robot traffic control system. This web page displays the current configuration of a society of mobile robots (stopping, direction of movement, avoiding, wandering, mapping, and planning). Only a brief description of the web GA is given in this paper.", "authors": ["James F.

{"abstract": "In a paper cryptanalyzing many triple modes of operation, Biham proposed four new triple modes and ve new quadruple modes of operation for DES. It was conjectured that the complexity (in a particu- lar threat model) of breaking the triple modes is at least 2 112 and that the quadruple modes are more secure than any triple mode. We present new attacks on all but one of the proposed modes. We can break all but two of Biham's proposed modes with at most 2 56 o-line trial encryptions and between 2 and 2 32 (depending upon the mode) chosen-IV chosen texts; another mode can be broken with somewhat more work. This raises questions about the suitability of the proposed modes, and provides further evidence for the fragility of inner chaining; however, we emphasize that our results do not disprove Biham's con- jectures, as we rely on an extended attack model which admits more powerful adversaries who can mount chosen-IV queries, a capability de- nied to them in Biham's model.", "authors": ["David Wagner"], "n_citation": 30, "references": ["07126582-6866-4799-aff8-d83c063eca0e", "1f7c5127-6c61-4e30-ba6c-782306a45b5e", "722def7b-3962-4ea8-848b-a7a4cfebf3e9", "7d6899a4-cc8a-44c2-95b3-d92cf38d373c", "e3fd35e9-cf1d-49ba-b140-cbfda7205e50"], "title": "Cryptanalysis of Some Recently-Proposed Multiple Modes of Operation", "venue": "fast software encryption", "year": 1998, "id": "567e86d8-39f7-4efe-8b34-21ef74cae986"}
{"abstract": "The anti-lock braking system (ABS) is the most important active safety system for passenger cars. Thanks to tire force measurement, provided for example by the new SKF load sensing hub bearing units, hybrid ABS algorithms can be made simpler and more robust than when only using wheel acceleration measurement. A two-phase algorithm is presented, where the wheel acceleration is controlled in closed-loop and the longitudinal force measurement is used to fire phase switching. Load transfer is accounted for using the vertical force measurement. Realistic simulations show that this simple algorithm can handle changes in vehicle velocity and tire-road friction without extra logic or adaptation of the controller parameters. Stability analysis provides tuning indications.

{"abstract": "Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used for stationary optimization problems. However, the environments of real world problems are often dynamic. This seriously challenges traditional evolutionary algorithms. In this paper, the application of population-based incremental learning (PBIL) algorithms, a class of evolutionary algorithms, for dynamic problems is investigated. Inspired by the complementarity mechanism in nature a Dual PBIL is proposed, which operates on two probability vectors that are dual to each other with respect to the central point in the genotype space. A diversity maintaining technique of combining the central probability vector into PBIL is also proposed to improve PBIL\u2019s adaptability in dynamic environments. In this paper, a new dynamic problem generator that can create required dynamics from any binary-encoded stationary problem is also formalized. Using this generator, a series of dynamic problems were systematically constructed from several benchmark stationary problems and an experimental study was carried out to compare the performance of several PBIL algorithms and two variants of standard genetic algorithm. Based on the experimental results, we carried out algorithm performance analysis regarding the weakness and strength of studied PBIL algorithms and identified several potential improvements to PBIL for dynamic optimization problems.", "authors": ["Shengxiang Yang", "Xin Yao"], "n_citation": 255, "references": ["00ba4d4b-30bf-42b8-92e6-03c860b1568d", "27681688-e444-4ce4-a802-a12cd89bb132", "2d032539-3a12-4d9c-8723-cbb593b7b4ec", "4339f057-308b-47a7-aaed-8e30b46da73f", "4b5a5e0f-a800-4f05-88a4-662261c72a8a", "6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3", "92752b7f-ad41-46c1-9e6c-965a6de2fe41", "957d98db-ad29-41a6-bc3a-f8d4e704228f", "c9715028-d306-4616-b5b7-639a2c7cc83b", "da235f44-0e10-40f5-85a5-19768431c579", "ddbd2064-d409-4f2c-92b6-f934fbf2ff01"], "title": "Experimental study on population-based incremental learning algorithms for dynamic optimization problems", "venue": "soft computing", "year": 2005, "id": "b672d331-f595-4e86-89ed-5483d044743d"}

Our taxonomy uncovers four broad design strategies: 'secretive,' where manipulations and effects are largely hidden; 'expressive,' where they tend to be revealed enabling the spectator to fully appreciate the performer's interaction; 'magical,' where effects are revealed but the manipulations that caused them are hidden; and finally 'suspenseful,' where manipulations are apparent but effects are only revealed as the spectator takes their turn.", "authors": ["Stuart Reeves", "Steve Benford", "Claire O'Malley", "Mike Fraser"], "n_citation": 394, "references": ["2b3679cd-7472-41e8-acee-a8594b479b2b", "309964b1-0616-404c-8804-05ddb739bd5d", "39d1f0e5-0fe0-4cd6-819e-5609a73d7631", "44356f25-7d37-4f6f-bcd3-4c54f14116cf", "4d605e67-c7a8-4161-93e6-8b64313f911b", "5072be0b-46d9-43c9-be7c-07bd75120a31", "7f2b75fa-5491-4b21-b550-f2caf6b89a56", "814b1baa-6ed1-46d1-8792-3d9b432863ab", "9c62ceb1-7606-44f1-94fb-901bff6fab3e", "bc1a3423-c70b-4dca-94f9-f0a7efc586d7", "c55ba55a-f029-44a2-9de9-56b4cb841e7c", "d551a5d9-9820-4ba6-9797-a87c6f29539c", "f08a755a-f174-4041-bec0-ac43bbe31072"], "title": "Designing the spectator experience", "venue": "human factors in computing systems", "year": 2005, "id": "28b6bbab-2131-4259-83c0-8201ef763f17"}

{"abstract": "We present a comprehensive methodology for realistically animating liquid phenomena. Our approach unifies existing computer graphics techniques for simulating fluids and extends them by incorporating more complex behavior. It is based on the Navier\u2013Stokes equations which couple momentum and mass conservation to completely describe fluid motion. Our starting point is an environment containing an arbitrary distribution of fluid, and submerged or semisubmerged obstacles. Velocity and pressure are defined everywhere within this environment and updated using a set of finite difference expressions. The resulting vector and scalar fields are used to drive a height field equation representing the liquid surface. The nature of the coupling between obstacles in the environment and free variables allows for the simulation of a wide range of effects that were not possible with previous computer graphics fluid models. Wave effects such as reflection, refraction, and diffraction, as well as rotational effects such as eddies, vorticity, and splashing are a natural consequence of solving the system. In addition, the Lagrange equations of motion are used to place buoyant dynamic objects into a scene and track the position of spray and foam during the animation process. Typical disadvantages to dynamic simulations such as poor scalability and lack of control are addressed by assuming that stationary obstacles align with grid cells during the finite difference discretization, and by appending terms to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations to include forcing functions. Free surfaces in our system are represented as either a collection of massless particles in 2D, or a height field which is suitable for many of the water rendering algorithms presented by researchers in recent years.", "authors": ["Nick Foster", "Dimitris N.

One of the major challenges is that an overabundance of small files is common in these applications, and HDFS manages all its files through a single server, the Namenode. It is anticipated that small files can significantly impact the performance of Namenode. In this work we propose a mechanism to store small files in HDFS efficiently and improve the space utilization for metadata. Our scheme is based on the assumption that each client is assigned a quota in the file system, for both the space and number of files. In our approach, we utilize the compression method \u2018harballing', provided by Hadoop, to better utilize the HDFS. We provide for new job functionality to allow for in-job archival of directories and files so that running MapReduce programs may complete without being killed by the JobTracker due to quota policies.

{"abstract": "Data cleaning is an important problem and data quality rules are the most promising way to face it with a declarative approach. Previous work has focused on specific formalisms, such as functional dependencies (FDs), conditional functional dependencies (CFDs), and matching dependencies (MDs), and those have always been studied in isolation. Moreover, such techniques are usually applied in a pipeline or interleaved. In this work we tackle the problem in a novel, unified framework. First, we let users specify quality rules using denial constraints with ad-hoc predicates. This language subsumes existing formalisms and can express rules involving numerical values, with predicates such as \u201cgreater than\u201d and \u201cless than\u201d. More importantly, we exploit the interaction of the heterogeneous constraints by encoding them in a conflict hypergraph. Such holistic view of the conflicts is the starting point for a novel definition of repair context which allows us to compute automatically repairs of better quality w.r.t. previous approaches in the literature. Experimental results on real datasets show that the holistic approach outperforms previous algorithms in terms of quality and efficiency of the repair.", "authors": ["Xu Chu", "Ihab F.

{"abstract": "The success of model checking is largely based on its ability to efficiently locate errors in software designs. If an error is found, a model checker produces a trail that shows how the error state can be reached, which greatly facilitates debugging. However, while current model checkers find error states efficiently, the counterexamples are often unnecessarily lengthy, which hampers error explanation. This is due to the use of \u201cnaive\u201d search algorithms in the state space exploration.In this paper we present approaches to the use of heuristic search algorithms in explicit-state model checking. We present the class of A* directed search algorithms and propose heuristics together with bitstate compression techniques for the search of safety property violations. We achieve great reductions in the length of the error trails, and in some instances render problems analyzable by exploring a much smaller number of states than standard depth-first search. We then suggest an improvement of the nested depth-first search algorithm and show how it can be used together with A* to improve the search for liveness property violations. Our approach to directed explicit-state model checking has been implemented in a tool set called HSF-SPIN. We provide experimental results from the protocol validation domain using HSF-SPIN.", "authors": ["Stefan Edelkamp", "Stefan Leue", "Alberto Lluch-Lafuente"], "n_citation": 199, "references": ["0d7a74d9-e9ca-44ce-b1f5-bede9787556c", "168b9773-c06b-4440-af4a-41d6c4d79c43", "1ee5c62d-9bdf-4228-b733-afd0ecf743ae", "41cf9713-ed76-43a6-8e9f-538abc2f787c", "64472932-3ee9-4649-96ed-a36ad3ccae34", "67b6f7a6-ade5-42be-ad58-d13eaaeb94f4", "7148d560-d2f9-4164-b985-7a4e39c3a096", "752a0858-0023-45c4-a29f-0410496164bb", "771eb178-abce-4d65-a279-fbe183f79220", "7914a8d8-005e-458a-ac26-9b919d99da8c", "8552a19a-291d-4d42-8e13-5a33a245f6f9", "8785ec1a-70c4-48ae-a51d-d6cd09a7350b", "8ea54639-35ea-46a6-b503-51ea152419a6", "b69e5483-aca9-4d77-9f33-d8bcda08ea9c", "b8bbb448-fedb-4b43-aa7e-82283a333437", "bf20d3ba-243b-46be-ad67-6610f03b2311", "c00bbb49-6e29-4103-8883-55acd23c248b", "c4f3c374-1d19-4c00-ae61-946249d8b557", "c9ce7ebb-7950-4064-a3c6-2c3939014763", "d4633091-aadd-4a27-accd-344d3e773ac8", "d6ed166d-b201-41af-9f7d-863f38748da0", "ddf7fede-08be-44ca-920b-bfeb54b2a862", "df5a4cb8-7af8-419d-854f-9ea8c21041d1", "fcc366e1-ddca-43df-ae8e-0b068926dc2f"], "title": "Directed explicit-state model checking in the validation of communication protocols", "venue": "International Journal on Software Tools for Technology Transfer", "year": 2004, "id": "532d2e5c-6c1d-4d65-888e-8af7c756d12d"}
{"abstract": "A fast color-based algorithm for recognizing colorful objects and colored textures is presented. Objects and textures are represented by just six numbers. Let r, g and b denote the 3 color bands of the image of an object (stretched out as vectors) then the color angular index comprises the 3 inter-band angles (one per pair of image vectors). The color edge angular index is calculated from the image's color edge map (the Laplacian of the color bands) in a similar way. These angles capture important low-order statistical information about the color and edge distributions and invariant to the spectral power distribution of the scene illuminant. The 6 illumination-invariant angles provide the basis for angular indexing into a database of objects or textures and has been tested on both Swain's database of color objects which were all taken under the same illuminant and Healey and Wang's database of color textures which were taken under several different illuminants. Color angular indexing yields excellent recognition rates for both data sets.", "authors": ["Graham D. Finlayson", "Subho S. Chatterjee", "Brian V.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present results from our empirical evaluations of a workspace awareness tool that we designed and implemented to augment the functionality of software configuration management systems. Particularly, we performed two user experiments directed at understanding the effectiveness of a workspace awareness tool in improving coordination and reducing conflicts. In the first experiment, we evaluated the tool through  text-based assignments  to avoid interference from the well-documented impact of individual differences among participants, as these differences are known to lessen the observable effect of proposed tools or to lead to them having no observable effect at all. This strategy of evaluating an application in a domain that is known to have less individual differences is novel and in our case particularly helpful in providing baseline quantifiable results. Upon this baseline, we performed a second experiment, with  code-based assignments , to validate that the tool's beneficial effects also occur in the case of programming. Together, our results provide quantitative evidence of the benefits of workspace awareness in software configuration management, as we demonstrate that it improves coordination and conflict resolution without inducing significant overhead in monitoring awareness cues.", "authors": ["Anita Sarma", "David F.

The technique of experience replay is used to update the critic weights to solve an IRL Bellman equation. This means, unlike existing reinforcement learning algorithms, recorded past experiences are used concurrently with current data for adaptation of the critic weights. It is shown that using this technique, instead of the traditional persistence of excitation condition which is often difficult or impossible to verify online, an easy-to-check condition on the richness of the recorded data is sufficient to guarantee convergence to a near-optimal control law.

We propose a model where widely known classification algorithms in combination with similarity techniques and prediction mechanisms provide the necessary means for retrieving recommendations.

A notation of simulation-based controllability and a synchronization scheme for the supervised system are formalized based on the simulation relation between the specification and the plant. It is shown that the existence of bisimilarity supervisors is characterized by the notions of the simulation-based controllability and the language observability, which extends the traditional results of supervisory control from language equivalence to bisimulation equivalence. In addition, a polynomial algorithm to test the simulation-based controllability is developed by constructing a computing tree.

{"abstract": "Distributed and concurrent object-oriented systems are difficult to analyze due to the complexity of their concurrency, communication, and synchronization mechanisms. Rather than performing analysis at the level of code in, e.g., Java or C++, we consider the analysis of such systems at the level of an abstract, executable modeling language. This language, based on concurrent objects communicating by asynchronous method calls, avoids some difficulties of mainstream object-oriented programming languages related to compositionality and aliasing. To facilitate system analysis, compositional verification systems are needed, which allow components to be analyzed independently of their environment. In this paper, a proof system for partial correctness reasoning is established based on communication histories and class invariants. A particular feature of our approach is that the alphabets of different objects are completely disjoint. Compared to related work, this allows the formulation of a much simpler Hoare-style proof system and reduces reasoning complexity by significantly simplifying formulas in terms of the number of needed quantifiers. The soundness and relative completeness of this proof system are shown using a transformational approach from a sequential language with a non-deterministic assignment operator.", "authors": ["Crystal Chang Din", "Johan Dovland", "Einar Broch Johnsen", "Olaf Owe"], "n_citation": 39, "references": ["0961c533-a959-422e-99eb-4ae14fd7680f", "24e6c166-a7e1-4b66-ad33-88c29de13025", "280c45ea-d6f5-4b47-8a9a-0aa120349bce", "357ef03b-3ad5-4793-a593-888b84bc6848", "47e5e0f3-05b2-4d76-be11-b9c11929615b", "5a0e1182-23ad-4a0c-a263-0bb34810ee01", "66509e1d-f55f-46f9-8cc5-ee6340b75225", "805f6c70-a279-4b19-a48a-24b7eca5f049", "82090002-8d7b-416e-8cb3-69038ee1a16a", "882607c2-d206-41c4-9e76-26d89352d4d2", "89309bee-b61e-4a09-b51d-ec520d9a3110", "a41259ee-bd31-4df4-987a-829232ac98dc", "b190ed55-3d0d-4485-82e7-97d974c1b41a", "c2732e69-cfed-456d-b8ce-b9337066930a", "c866a392-109a-4c86-862f-8e202f27721f", "d690da76-456a-4836-af9f-74d2f1e154fd", "f17210ac-9e60-4323-89b3-d9697ab6496e", "f7174abb-1260-41ad-8b57-4a3ca4919670"], "title": "Observable behavior of distributed systems : component reasoning for concurrent objects", "venue": "The Journal of Logic and Algebraic Programming", "year": 2012, "id": "282813a1-afd5-4b56-a239-72b1a5e9d92f"}

LogiMOO is implemented on top of a multi-threaded blackboard-based logic programming system (BinProlog) featuring Linda-style coordination. Remote and local blackboards support transparent distribution of data and processing over TCP/IP links, while threads ensure high-performance local client-server dynamics. Embedding in Netscape provides advanced VRML and HTML frame-based navigation and multi-media support, while LogiMOO handles virtual presence and acts as a very high-level multi-media object broker. User-friendliness is achieved through a controlled English interface written in terms of Assumption Grammars. Its language coverage is extensible in that the user can incorporate new nouns, verbs and adjectives as needed by changes in the world. Immediate evaluation of world knowledge by the parser yields representations which minimize the unknowns allowing us to deal with advanced Natural Language constructs like anaphora and relativization efficiently.

{"abstract": "Dynamical systems enjoy a rich variety of mathematical representations, from interconnections of convolution operators or rational functions of a complex variable to systems of (possibly stochastic) differential or differential-algebraic equations. Although many of these representations can describe the same behavior, i.e. represent the same constraints on manifest variables, each one may characterize a different notion of system structure. This paper introduces a method for interpreting the semantics of different representations of a network system by exploring the set of realizations consistent with each. We then focus on signal structure, extending its definition, and demonstrate that its semantics differ from other network representations in important and useful ways.

{"abstract": "Despite JavaScript runtime's lack of conventional threads, the presence of asynchrony creates a real potential for concurrency errors. These concerns have lead to investigations of race conditions in the Web context. However, focusing on races does not produce actionable error reports that would at the end of the day appeal to developers and cause them to fix possible underlying problems.   In this paper, we advocate for the notion of observable races, focusing on concurrency conditions that lead to visually apparent glitches caused by non-determinism within the runtime scheduler on the network. We propose and investigate ways to find observable races via systematically exploring possible network schedules and shepherding the scheduler towards correct executions. We propose crowd-sourcing both to spot when different schedules lead to visually broken sites and also to determine under what environment conditions (OS, browser, network speed) these schedules may in fact happen in practice for some fraction of the users.", "authors": ["Erdal Mutlu", "Serdar Tasiran", "Benjamin Livshits"], "n_citation": 8, "references": ["3da160a2-fbbb-44a6-a594-b4f6f938e4be", "440c32ee-b296-47b4-bd9e-c57e9743fd47", "979e0944-8e6c-44b1-b8d8-decf9038896e", "cad5f6c4-a2c9-4318-9c41-03645800300f", "eb791e3e-6f8a-4b0b-9e47-bcc5fc90fcf9", "fe0623a1-45fe-48c6-b0b7-9a2ad8313a53", "ffbb3160-00f7-4b5a-ad4e-d1f90ac26400"], "title": "I Know It When I See It: Observable Races in JavaScript Applications", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "id": "f815bcd7-57f4-4af3-8eab-bc17acbdf0f2"}
{"abstract": "Abstract   Objectives:  To address the problem of alignment of health information systems to healthcare processes, which is a major challenge in healthcare organizations; to present a layered approach for system evolution and adaptation based on an application framework and rapid application development; to accomplish a demand-driven system evolution by embedding the software engineering process in business process optimization projects and by closely involving end users to improve their own work practices.  Methods:  We have used a holistic health information system as a core application framework. System functionality is incrementally improved using an integrated \"generator tool\" for rapid application development. We have developed an iterative and participatory software engineering process, adapted to the conditions of the generator tool. The documentation techniques provided by the Unified Modeling Language (UML) were modified to achieve a straight forward documentation covering the whole development cycle from the business process model to generator-based computer applications.  Results and conclusion:  The layered approach for system evolution did provide an environment in which a flexible and participatory software development process could be established. Today, generator-based applications are used in all clinical departments of our 1200-bed University Hospital. We expect that tools for rapid application development will be further improved and will play an increasingly important role to establish responsive IT-infrastructures where the application developer can concentrate on business process alignment instead of coding and debugging.", "authors": ["Richard Lenz", "Klaus A.

{"abstract": "Type systems for programming languages with numeric types can be extended to support the checking of units of measure. Quantification over units then introduces a new kind of parametric polymorphism with a corresponding Reynolds-style representation independence principle: that the behaviour of programs is invariant under changes to the units used. We prove this 'dimensional invariance' result and describe four consequences. The first is that the type of an expression can be used to derive equations which describe its properties with respect to scaling (akin to Wadler's 'theorems for free' for System F). Secondly there are certain types which are inhabited only by trivial terms. For example, we prove that a fully polymorphic square root function cannot be written using just the usual arithmetic primitives. Thirdly we exhibit interesting isomorphisms between types and for first-order types relate these to the central theorem of classical dimensional analysis. Finally we suggest that for any expression whose behaviour is dimensionally invariant there exists some equivalent expression whose type reflects this behaviour, a consequence of which would be a full abstraction result for a model of the language.", "authors": ["Andrew Kennedy"], "n_citation": 66, "references": ["3f611783-533e-45fd-ba8a-08b94b3a9d66", "42f7fb9a-18b9-446b-9141-18fda062c8a2", "457fdf5a-9225-433e-a707-bbe8d0e8da35", "54d8d700-ff71-4715-8263-2cce56444a40", "85dc2a93-f8ba-4f90-91f5-9bb78c1ba2e9", "b5cc3906-2ac1-45cd-bbf6-de94b8a65c1b", "d4f5860d-0fa6-4ffd-b940-b0773b27b0ad", "fb07b507-9785-4320-a824-c17e9b1a7206"], "title": "Relational parametricity and units of measure", "venue": "symposium on principles of programming languages", "year": 1997, "id": "79110fc1-0f97-496e-8bd1-c5cfb27394ab"}

{"abstract": "A neural fuzzy system learning with fuzzy training data (fuzzy if-then rules) is proposed in this paper. This system is able to process and learn numerical information as well as linguistic information. At first, we propose a five-layered neural network for the connectionist realization of a fuzzy inference system. The connectionist structure can house fuzzy logic rules and membership functions for fuzzy inference. We use /spl alpha/-level sets of fuzzy numbers to represent linguistic information. The inputs, outputs, and weights of the proposed network can be fuzzy numbers of any shape. Furthermore, they can be hybrid of fuzzy numbers and numerical numbers through the use of fuzzy singletons. Based on interval arithmetics, a fuzzy supervised learning algorithm is developed for the proposed system. It extends the normal supervised learning techniques to the learning problems where only linguistic teaching signals are available. The fuzzy supervised learning scheme can train the proposed system with desired fuzzy input-output pairs which are fuzzy numbers instead of the normal numerical values. With fuzzy supervised learning, the proposed system can be used for rule base concentration to reduce the number of rules in a fuzzy rule base. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the performance and applicability of the proposed system.", "authors": ["Chin-Teng Lin", "Ya-Ching Lu"], "n_citation": 91, "references": ["00772b08-e165-4a1c-b5d6-2cd2915d7c20", "1a778a69-104d-4f2b-beea-bbfb1bf72e6f", "38b03ef9-349b-4332-9384-a8cc608c4df6", "4524b811-d9fd-4aaf-8f4c-7503c61284a7", "5311684a-34b0-4456-a4bb-035b5d536f34", "a35a45bf-372f-4df8-9f55-ac6784090faa", "c047f034-ff3d-4439-858b-37d066c59748", "c9cd95ef-9a83-47be-904d-756e80c904fd", "cd13fec9-0a7b-4061-8f44-6b0b5c92defe"], "title": "A neural fuzzy system with fuzzy supervised learning", "venue": "systems man and cybernetics", "year": 1996, "id": "76dbb4c5-c42f-4e58-a77e-40f27c6345d4"}
{"abstract": "Sensor networks are distributed event-based systems that differ from traditional communication networks in several ways: sensor networks have severe energy constraints, redundant low-rate data, and many-to-one flows. Data-centric mechanisms that perform in-network aggregation of data are needed in this setting for energy-efficient information flow. In this paper we model data-centric routing and compare its performance with traditional end-to-end routing schemes. We examine the impact of source-destination placement and communication network density on the energy costs and delay associated with data aggregation. We show that data-centric routing offers significant performance gains across a wide range of operational scenarios. We also examine the complexity of optimal data aggregation, showing that although it is an NP-hard problem in general, there exist useful polynomial-time special cases.", "authors": ["L.

{"abstract": "Based on the work of the Nesterov and Todd on self-scaled cones an implementation of a primal-dual interior-point method for solving large-scale sparse conic quadratic optimization problems is presented. The main features of the implementation are it is based on a homogeneous and self-dual model, it handles rotated quadratic cones directly, it employs a Mehrotra type predictor-corrector extension and sparse linear algebra to improve the computational efficiency. Finally, the implementation exploits fixed variables which naturally occurs in many conic quadratic optimization problems. This is a novel feature for our implementation.

{"abstract": "An M/G/1 queue with server vacations and gated time-limited service is analyzed. At each visit, the server serves the queue up to a fixed amount of time. When the time expires or after all candidate customers have been served, whichever occurs first, the server takes a vacation. The service policy is gated, since only those customers present at the beginning of a server visit (poling instant) are candidates for service during that visit; subsequent arrivals are deferred until the next visit. A functional equation which characterizes the amount of work, U/sub p/, at a polling instant is derived. To solve the equation, a numerical technique is utilized in which the complementary cumulative function for U/sub p/ is closely approximated by a weighted sum of Laguerre functions with unknown coefficients. The equation is then transformed into a set of linear equations from which the coefficients can be computed. By the stochastic decomposition and Poisson-arrivals-see-time-averages properties, the average customer response time can be related to the average amount of work found by an arrival. Several numerical examples are included. The model studied is applicable to communication and computer systems where timers are used to allocate service to customers. >", "authors": ["Kin K.

{"abstract": "Insects are able to return to important places in their environment by storing an image of the surroundings while at the goal, and later computing a home direction from a matching between this \u2018snapshot\u2019 image and the currently perceived image. Very similar ideas are pursued for the visual navigation of mobile robots. A wide range of different solutions for the matching between the two images have been suggested. This paper explores the application of optical flow techniques for visual homing. The performance of five different flow techniques and a reference method is analysed based on image collections from three different indoor environments. We show that block matching, two simple variants of block matching and two even simpler differential techniques produce robust homing behaviour, despite the simplicity of the matched features. Our analysis reveals that visual homing can succeed even in the presence of many incorrect feature correspondences, and that low-frequency features are sufficient for homing. In particular, the successful application of differential methods opens new vistas on the visual homing problem, both as plausible and parsimonious models of visual insect navigation, and as a starting point for novel robot navigation methods.", "authors": ["Andrew Vardy", "Ralf M\u00f6ller"], "n_citation": 137, "references": ["0c94938c-4e0e-438f-9fba-7095290fa8dd", "130140f5-c3dc-4596-abe1-42ed6de88094", "32148a0b-6ce4-4a1e-a1d2-98a96b27b24f", "48aa41df-55f4-4ad4-b7c1-b183d5d81ab4", "4c6e698b-8caf-4c4b-ab65-5ba8f9ea7597", "50212652-4999-4f13-82d6-a37eb2862a73", "5c87d0aa-ca65-48f9-88f6-3a31866d6794", "660f8db4-3ffa-45a7-bab0-e962707790e2", "74300838-5362-4bad-b04e-caafc5a75bc9", "7c808bfc-a6e9-47ce-82f1-c4a8f4c59f4f", "83e1c3b7-a4ff-4982-bba8-3f3aeacfcdf4", "88e324cb-3391-47f8-b57e-45a09e9abc98", "96667231-4049-4e4a-bf20-7d4b3db79455", "a1531384-8e98-4aaf-89f7-73769a4cbe65", "b5a74a85-3b6f-4440-b794-fff78055636d", "b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b", "bbb1a98c-332d-4ee7-aac8-5c0f5b8dd356", "d2528c65-f90a-4346-8313-e54af9017762", "dc99d46a-f598-4ae6-ad1e-37f7a96d3fdf", "ebfca554-7a3c-4597-954b-07336a2e3030", "ee6e39c8-c5a9-4831-bfb7-2d2b520cf63a", "f0393ff2-f0ae-49b8-b29f-e5deb0f69406", "f1af4e97-6283-47df-acf9-3b0ee025e5f8"], "title": "Biologically plausible visual homing methods based on optical flow techniques", "venue": "Connection Science", "year": 2005, "id": "8f2f9e96-0867-4f2f-a841-f42c96d2dc95"}

{"abstract": "Traditional file structures that provide multikey access to records, for example, inverted files, are extensions of file structures originally designed for single-key access. They manifest various deficiencies in particular for multikey access to highly dynamic files. We study the dynamic aspects of file structures that treat all keys symmetrically, that is, file structures which avoid the distinction between primary and secondary keys. We start from a bitmap approach and treat the problem of file design as one of data compression of a large sparse matrix. This leads to the notions of a  grid partition  of the search space and of a  grid directory , which are the keys to a dynamic file structure called the  grid file . This file system adapts gracefully to its contents under insertions and deletions, and thus achieves an upper bound of two disk accesses for single record retrieval; it also handles range queries and partially specified queries efficiently. We discuss in detail the design decisions that led to the grid file, present simulation results of its behavior, and compare it to other multikey access file structures.", "authors": ["J\u00fcrg Nievergelt", "Hans Hinterberger", "Kenneth C.

{"abstract": "Robustness and discrimination are two of the most important objectives in image hashing. We incorporate ring partition and invariant vector distance to image hashing algorithm for enhancing rotation robustness and discriminative capability. As ring partition is unrelated to image rotation, the statistical features that are extracted from image rings in perceptually uniform color space, i.e., CIE L*a*b* color space, are rotation invariant and stable. In particular, the Euclidean distance between vectors of these perceptual features is invariant to commonly used digital operations to images (e.g., JPEG compression, gamma correction, and brightness/contrast adjustment), which helps in making image hash compact and discriminative. We conduct experiments to evaluate the efficiency with 250 color images, and demonstrate that the proposed hashing algorithm is robust at commonly used digital operations to images. In addition, with the receiver operating characteristics curve, we illustrate that our hashing is much better than the existing popular hashing algorithms at robustness and discrimination.", "authors": ["Zhenjun Tang", "Xianquan Zhang", "Xianxian Li", "Shichao Zhang"], "n_citation": 9, "references": ["03463023-6682-4154-9b15-b2c5de413af0", "05692914-e141-474f-8e0b-6d81a1eef556", "13663ced-a187-42c4-b12c-fcfcf278f03b", "19b7759a-35d3-472e-b7c2-f65b523261a7", "25cf0b20-4f2d-4ad9-b3e2-ee7ace277acd", "2d647db4-553b-4e39-b3d2-98c2a0acba22", "2e039a57-0910-40a7-80cb-27410812ef4d", "3795f9f1-853b-4e0d-8688-2107bcd24619", "3f4637c0-1b89-45ec-b19a-84e8aadc6a48", "40e4846c-6d89-4695-94ec-9471998f392f", "44860537-5fc7-418a-96b5-076b8f449306", "59ac97c2-5c99-4ab2-9321-50e99e9bcedb", "5a57dd1f-6564-4ec1-81b1-9a2cb9f06c75", "600ba46d-5ee8-4c81-8c1d-74d4e8e3bfe7", "698adea0-9e7b-43b0-a573-c5e0636b5901", "7289235d-b1e1-4ea5-b4c3-12959aed62e9", "79cd82b8-4125-444c-bd92-c723f3e70071", "8e5de836-8da8-4b27-a490-3fa82c2de8ef", "a48c4b7d-158f-46ba-bd22-8f14544a4814", "ac154f5c-3320-44f7-8b9d-c7b12d4977e4", "ae46bc38-32f5-49ae-9862-ad5606eb1089", "b5f4ac61-2db3-4936-9493-c7a7f5bcb0c2", "c169bdbf-6f09-454a-9cec-f1b9a22155f9", "cacff2e4-5289-4a3c-8b63-c65b80159f9f", "ce85231c-f692-45d3-b8c3-3c7a5a621289", "cf54381c-6201-4ae2-8b0c-48de41c9a63f", "ecd22398-5d0e-464e-8c9a-28136b8359f0"], "title": "Robust Image Hashing With Ring Partition and Invariant Vector Distance", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security", "year": 2016, "id": "51fc3fe8-76ca-4a98-b424-c839295a6654"}

{"abstract": "Context: Evidence Based Software Engineering (EBSE) has recently been proposed as a methodology to help practitioners improve their technology adoption decisions given their particular circumstances. Formally, Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are a part of EBSE. There has been a noticeable take up of SLRs by researchers, but little has been published on whether, and then how, the EBSE methodology has been applied in full.#R##N##R##N#Objectives: To empirically evaluate the use of EBSE by undergraduate students. To consider how insights into the students' performance with EBSE can be applied to software practitioners' expected performance with EBSE. To gain insights into the use of Supplementary EBSE Guidelines and associated Assessment Schemes.#R##N##R##N#Method: 37 final-year undergraduate students completed a coursework assessment that required them to use EBSE to evaluate one or more of four Requirements Management Tools (RMTs): Telelogic DOORs\u00ae, Borland's Caliber\u00ae Analyst, Compuware Optimal Trace\u2122, and GODA ARTS. Students were provided with a range of EBSE resources, including a set of Supplementary EBSE Guidelines, to assist them with their EBSE evaluation. An Assessment Scheme was development to assess the degree to which students followed the Supplementary Guidelines. A feedback questionnaire, completed by 12 of the 37 students, complemented the Assessment Scheme.#R##N##R##N#Results: 78% of students chose to evaluate a RMT that is currently a market leader. 62% of students subsequently recommended the adoption of their chosen RTM. Some students made a recommendation because the Guidelines indicated they should, rather than making a recommendation because the evidence 'entailed' that recommendation. Only 8% of students intentionally made no recommendation, and this seems to be on the basis of the poor quality of evidence available on the chosen RMT(s). All 12 students who completed the feedback questionnaire reported that this was the hardest or nearly the hardest assessment that the student had ever done! 67% of these 12 students reported that they had not given themselves sufficient time to complete the evaluation, and 83% reported that they had to balance their time on this evaluation with other commitments. The12 students found EBSE steps 1 and 4 to be the easiest and EBSE steps 2 and 3 to be the hardest, and they generally reported that they had received sufficient support from the EBSE resources made available to them.#R##N##R##N#Conclusion: This study presents independent, empirical evidence of the full use of EBSE, to complement the growing body of published SLRs. We believe that the findings on students' use of EBSE are relevant to understanding professional practitioners' prospective use of EBSE. Both students and professionals would: find EBSE very challenging, in particular the SLRs; be subject to constraints and trade-offs; may not be able to find relevant and rigorous evidence; and may make errors in their critical thinking whilst conducting the evaluation. Our findings should benefit researchers, practitioners and educators.", "authors": ["Austen Rainer", "Sarah Beecham"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["09115411-e4c5-45fe-8c65-7ae05affa5de", "0fd79d7f-9b3f-4cf4-b72b-7fa7852ae26f", "12045e23-36e6-4993-9ff1-fdf65ec91fb8", "33d84369-69c2-4e97-a70a-8096240368db", "4c1c86de-d732-42fa-a7e1-e801ff97daba", "5821b7ac-4676-45fb-aff8-e9ff3e295f60", "91afdcb0-845d-473c-a962-0d4efbcdc496", "97026472-25f3-42bb-9570-b5165b5889c3", "aad18b58-80d8-4c70-a5c6-11966aec89d6", "c9d29c82-71e6-48a8-8117-90cbeb053345", "d20d8505-e5e3-4164-9e68-a39d33b4cf9c", "d4c3a0a8-80f6-4450-b678-639692543e25", "defd6e9c-2223-4532-95d4-fdd2615215c3", "ff394ff0-4f7d-4f00-b3f9-082b28b036c6"], "title": "A follow-up empirical evaluation of evidence based software engineering by undergraduate students", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "id": "edcc4626-94e6-400f-8947-d6f4c44993ef"}
{"abstract": "Regression analysis (fitting a model to noisy data) is a basic technique in computer vision, Robust regression methods that remain reliable in the presence of various types of noise are therefore of considerable importance. We review several robust estimation techniques and describe in detail the least-median-of-squares (LMedS) method. The method yields the correct result even when half of the data is severely corrupted. Its efficiency in the presence of Gaussian noise can be improved by complementing it with a weighted least-squares-based procedure. The high time-complexity of the LMedS algorithm can be reduced by a Monte Carlo type speed-up technique. We discuss the relationship of LMedS with the RANSAC paradigm and its limitations in the presence of noise corrupting all the data, and we compare its performance with the class of robust M-estimators.

{"abstract": "Modern day enterprises exhibit a growing trend toward adoption of enterprise computing services for efficient resource utilization, scalability, and flexibility. These environments are characterized by heterogeneous, distributed computing systems exchanging enormous volumes of time-critical data with varying levels of access control in a dynamic business environment. The enterprises are thus faced with significant challenges as they endeavor to achieve their primary goals, and simultaneously ensure enterprise-wide secure interoperation among the various collaborating entities. Key among these challenges are providing effective mechanism for enforcement of enterprise policy across distributed domains, ensuring secure content-based access to enterprise resources at all user levels, and allowing the specification of temporal and nontemporal context conditions to support fine-grained dynamic access control. In this paper, we investigate these challenges, and present X-GTRBAC, an XML-based GTRBAC policy specification language and its implementation for enforcing enterprise-wide access control. Our specification language is based on the GTRBAC model that incorporates the content- and context-aware dynamic access control requirements of an enterprise. An X-GTRBAC system has been implemented as a Java application. We discuss the salient features of the specification language, and present the software architecture of our system. A comprehensive example is included to discuss and motivate the applicability of the X-GTRBAC framework to a generic enterprise environment. An application level interface for implementing the policy in the X-GTRBAC system is also provided to consolidate the ideas presented in the paper.", "authors": ["Rafae Bhatti", "Arif Ghafoor", "Elisa Bertino", "James B.

{"abstract": "Advances in 3D scanning technologies have enabled the practical creation of meshes with hundreds of millions of polygons. Traditional algorithms for display, simplification, and progressive transmission of meshes are impractical for data sets of this size. We describe a system for representing and progressively displaying these meshes that combines a multiresolution hierarchy based on bounding spheres with a rendering system based on points. A single data structure is used for view frustum culling, backface culling, level-of-detail selection, and rendering. The representation is compact and can be computed quickly, making it suitable for large data sets. Our implementation, written for use in a large-scale 3D digitization project, launches quickly, maintains a user-settable interactive frame rate regardless of object complexity or camera position, yields reasonable image quality during motion, and refines progressively when idle to a high final image quality.

In this model, revocation messages are only sent to signature verifiers (as opposed to both signers and verifiers). Consequently there is no need to contact individual signers when some user is revoked. This model is appealing for systems providing attestation capabilities. Our signatures are as short as standard RSA signatures with comparable security.

Convergence to the global optimum is guaranteed with multiple passes through the Cascade, but already a single pass provides good generalization. A single pass is 5x - 10x faster than a regular SVM for problems of 100,000 vectors when implemented on a single processor.

{"abstract": "Background:  Bug fixing lies at the core of most software maintenance efforts. Most prior studies examine the effort needed to fix a bug ( fix-effort ). However, the effort needed to fix a bug may not correlate with the calendar time needed to fix it ( fix-time ). For example, the fix-time for bugs with low fix-effort may be long if they are considered to be of low priority.    Aims:  We study the fix-time for bugs in large open source projects.    Method:  We study the fix-time along three dimensions: (1) the location of the bug (e.g., which component), (2) the reporter of the bug, and (3) the description of the bug. Using these three dimensions and their associated attributes, we examine the fix-time for bugs in two large open source projects: Eclipse and Mozilla, using a random forest classifier.    Results:  We show that we can correctly classify ~65% of the time the fix-time for bugs in these projects. We perform a sensitivity analysis to identify the most important attributes in each dimension. We find that the time of the filing of a bug and its location are the most important attributes in the Mozilla project for determining the fix-time of a bug. On the other hand, the fix-time in the Eclipse project is highly dependant on the severity of the bug. Surprisingly, the priority of the bug is not an important attribute when determining the fix-time for a bug in both projects.

{"abstract": "We claim that a dynamic-agent infrastructure can provide a shift from static distributed computing to dynamic distributed computing, and we have developed such an infrastructure to realize such a shift. We shall show its impact on software engineering through a comparison with other distributed object-oriented systems such as CORBA and DCOM, and demonstrate its value in highly dynamic system integration and service provisioning. The infrastructure is Java-based, light-weight, and extensible. It differs from other agent platforms and client/server infrastructures in its support of dynamic behavior modification of agents. A dynamic-agent is not designed to have a fixed set of predefined functions but instead, to carry application-specific actions, which can be loaded and modified on theory. This allows a dynamic-agent to adjust its capability for accommodating environment and requirement changes, and play different roles across multiple applications.

{"abstract": "In this paper, iris recognition system using wavelet packet and support vector machines is presented. It specifically uses the multiresolution decomposition of 2-D discrete wavelet packet transform for extracting the unique features from the acquired iris image. This method of feature extraction is well suited to describe the shape of the iris while allowing the algorithm to be translation and rotation invariant. The SVM approach for comparing the similarity between the similar and different irises can be assessed to have the feature's discriminative power. We have showed that the proposed method for human iris recognition gave a way of representing iris patterns in an efficient manner and thus had advantages of saving both time and space.

{"abstract": "The \u201cwaite-free hierarchy\u201d provides a classification of multiprocessor synchronization primitives based on the values of  n  for which there are deterministic wait-free implementations of  n -process consensus using instances of these objects and  read-write  registers. In a randomized wait-free setting, this classification is degenerate, since  n -process consensus can be solved using only  O(n) read-write  registers.  In this paper, we propose a classification of synchronization primitives based on the  space complexity  of randomized solutions to  n -process consensus. A  historyless object,  such as a  read-write  register, a    swap  register, or a  tests(    n      object instances are necessary to solve  n -process consensus. This lower bound holds even if the objects have unbounded size and the termination requirement is  nondeterministic solo termination , a property strictly weaker than randomized wait-freedom.  We then use this result to related the randomized space complexity of basic multiprocessor synchronization primitives such as  shared counters, fetch&add  registers, and  compare&swap  registers.

{"abstract": "A shaper is a system that stores incoming bits in a buffer and delivers them as early as possible, while forcing the output to be constrained with a given arrival curve. A shaper is time invariant if the traffic constraint is defined by a fixed arrival curve; it is time varying if the condition on the output is given by a time varying traffic contract. This occurs, for example, with renegotiable variable bit rate (RVBR) services. We focus on the class of time varying shapers called time varying leaky bucket shapers; such shapers are defined by a fixed numbers of leaky buckets, whose parameters (rate and bucket size) are changed at specific transition moments. We assume that the bucket levels are kept unchanged at those transition moments (no reset assumption). Our main finding is an input-output characterisation for this class of time varying shapers. Then we apply it to the tradeoff in optimising the RVBR service, assuming that a perfect prediction of future traffic can be made. We provide two algorithms that solve the problem of finding, at any renegotiation, the parameters for a RVBR service, respectively when the knowledge of the input traffic is limited to the next interval (local optimisation problem) and when we dispose of the complete input traffic description (global optimisation problem). We compare, by means of simulation, the two resulting algorithms to study the validity of the local approach. We illustrate the impact of the no-reset assumption by analyzing on some examples the losses that occur when the source chooses the opposite approach, namely, the reset approach. Furthermore we simulate the RVBR service versus the renegotiable constant bit rate (RCBR) service and illustrate that the RVBR approach can provide substantial benefits. Finally, we discuss the impact of the size of the renegotiation interval on the efficiency of the RVBR service.", "authors": ["Silvia Giordano", "Jean-Yves Le Boudec"], "n_citation": 20, "title": "On a class of time varying shapers with application to the renegotiable variable bit rate service", "venue": "Journal of High Speed Networks", "year": 2000, "id": "073a8040-2c09-441c-9841-82c9971557dc"}

{"abstract": "The increasing need for continuously available softwaresystems has raised two key-issues: self-adaptation anddesign evolution. The former one requires software systems to monitor their execution platform and automatically adapt their configuration and/or architecture to adjust their quality of service (optimization, fault-handling). The later one requires new design decisions to be reflected on the fly on the running system to ensure the needed high availability (new requirements, corrective and preventive maintenance). However, design evolution and selfadaptationare not independent and reflecting a design evolution on a running self-adaptative system is not always safe. We propose to unify run-time adaptation and run-time evolution by monitoring both the run-time platform and the design models. Thus, it becomes possible to correlate those heterogeneous events and to use pattern matching on events to elaborate a pertinent decision for run-time adaptation. A flood prediction system deployed along the Ribble river (Yorkshire, England) is used to illustrate how to unify design evolution and run-time adaptation and to safely perform runtime evolution on adaptive systems.", "authors": ["Brice Morin", "Thomas Ledoux", "Mahmoud Ben Hassine", "Franck Chauvel", "Olivier Barais", "Jean-Marc J\u00e9z\u00e9quel"], "n_citation": 18, "references": ["00199e54-1891-4e79-b6e5-ca2b631753d4", "1c43b91b-8973-4773-ae23-7a4f4a0adc58", "40d5d62c-353e-408b-8256-2c59128ca519", "435ca080-ce9e-4f88-8e53-9c87578a7cab", "5a8d2caf-0f2a-4f7a-9328-ddc1fe4535da", "5aa39aa9-2b54-42af-b66e-6db07b911248", "5d9c0a99-0c3f-4c83-ae3e-d840cf752b9b", "7e09b35a-73c1-420f-b62f-03bfd779a59e", "7f4eda29-2a02-4fe9-bcd4-03a7c2ccac99", "8292d169-f379-4939-a8dd-67f6bfafa956", "d8ab7e3c-70f0-430a-8876-0a784d8cfa0d", "de93c3a3-68f3-4105-8129-d168f1d9289c", "e19a222e-7158-4ceb-8e9c-fd55c7e1e05b", "e2593748-76d0-41b2-ac6b-1f72abea0652"], "title": "Unifying Runtime Adaptation and Design Evolution", "venue": "computer and information technology", "year": 2009, "id": "235b60b8-b9b7-4aa6-a1e1-e1d91014b54a"}
{"abstract": "The difficulty of handling out-of-core data limits the performance of supercomputers as well as the potential of the parallel machines. Since writing an efficient out-of-core version of a program is a difficult task and virtual memory systems do not perform well on scientific computations, we believe that there is a clear need for compiler directed explicit I/O approach for out-of-core computations. In this paper, we first present an out-of-core compilation strategy based on a disk storage abstraction. Then, we offer a compiler algorithm to optimize locality of disk accesses in out-of-core codes by choosing a good combination of file layouts on disks and loop transformations. We introduce memory coefficient and processor coefficient concepts to characterize the behavior of out-of-core programs under different memory constraints. We also enhance our algorithm to handle data-parallel programs which contain multiple loop nest. Our initial experimental results obtained on IBM SP-2 and Intel Paragon provide encouraging evidence that our approach is successful at optimizing programs which depend on disk-resident data in distributed-memory machines.", "authors": ["Mahmut T.

{"abstract": "Bounded-exhaustive testing is an automated testing methodology that checks the code under test for  all inputs  within given bounds: first the user describes a set of test inputs and provides test oracles that check test outputs; then the tool generates all the inputs, executes them on the code under test, and checks the outputs; and finally the user inspects failing tests to submit bug reports. The costs of bounded-exhaustive testing include machine time for test generation and execution (which translates into human time waiting for these results) and human time for inspection of results. This paper proposes three techniques that reduce these costs. Sparse Test Generation skips some tests to reduce the time to the first failing test. Structural Test Merging generates a smaller number of larger test inputs (rather than a larger number of smaller test inputs) to reduce test generation and execution time. Oracle-based Test Clustering groups failing tests to reduce the inspection time. Results obtained from the bounded-exhaustive testing of the Eclipse refactoring engine show that these three techniques can substantially reduce the costs while mostly preserving fault-detection capability.", "authors": ["Vilas Jagannath", "Yun Young Lee", "Brett Daniel", "Darko Marinov"], "n_citation": 30, "references": ["0bd7b323-b8a6-4324-a5df-436dcf10804b", "173323ea-abc6-4845-95fa-0d58f9d056a2", "1f366976-a81f-49c1-85a7-8a1243769bb9", "3c9287f2-65e3-4735-88ac-6c7fec79e0d3", "45dd76d4-c90b-4010-9e70-e86d05505a5b", "4b4e3539-6ea7-455d-a46a-ff33e3a0f3e3", "538c691a-555d-498c-82a8-c024e9a2d71c", "58a77f39-fd3c-4379-9f04-5fdac60a736f", "643c7a49-f904-4493-97ff-9da851d48de3", "67fdaffd-21ee-439e-b6ac-6142e3386e6d", "689fb693-5e04-4f35-8933-df43d46c8b17", "6e8ea39b-5d8f-43e5-9663-84abb1b52da6", "741ba1e5-8649-4fe9-bc70-bfbcda8618e1", "8ba5783c-0839-4264-acd5-f856ea8cfc20", "9372712d-96ad-4de6-b35d-1747759884f7", "b131def4-c3ed-4885-8891-9fc7d6b67d68", "bb9a3524-56be-4892-a1a5-284888b2b847", "bf6c3897-326e-4b9f-9a50-aefe175e354d", "c28cf51b-79cf-4b24-9234-8b304f11e6ca", "c659438c-7f79-49c8-8fee-f86155373ca2", "cbaa2dcc-51db-4cfe-99d9-ce067ab0ccfb", "cc57c248-48e2-441b-906e-3f8bd6c81d26", "d5a730d1-2b10-4434-a00f-a1a99df4c72d", "d6b825c5-a14c-43c0-9b22-770f1db48715", "d6c5bdb2-f3f1-4c10-9b36-76d6be2a423f", "de0526f8-c7a6-4134-9b60-5d76d46e080e", "e7b3547a-09f3-45ef-a63c-1fbb7d58c56d", "f912859b-270e-46e9-a960-b24df9786560", "fa99fa37-a4e8-4a98-a590-f19d7b4d5abe"], "title": "Reducing the Costs of Bounded-Exhaustive Testing", "venue": "fundamental approaches to software engineering", "year": 2009, "id": "18fa194c-e7dd-402e-8ae1-5502f6357482"}
{"abstract": "The requirements that force decisions towards building distributed system architectures are usually of a non-functional nature. Scalability, openness, heterogeneity, and fault-tolerance are examples of such non-functional requirements. The current trend is to build distributed systems with middleware, which provide the application developer with primitives for managing the complexity of distribution, system resources, and for realising many of the non-functional requirements. As non-functional requirements evolve, the `coupling' between the middleware and architecture becomes the focal point for understanding the stability of the distributed software system architecture in the face of change. It is hypothesised that the choice of a stable distributed software architecture depends on the choice of the underlying middleware and its flexibility in responding to future changes in non-functional requirements. Drawing on a case study that adequately represents a medium-size component-based distributed architecture, it is reported how a likely future change in scalability could impact the architectural structure of two versions, each induced with a distinct middleware: one with CORBA and the other with J2EE. An option-based model is derived to value the flexibility of the induced-architectures and to guide the selection. The hypothesis is verified to be true for the given change. The paper concludes with some observations that could stimulate future research in the area of relating requirements to software architectures.", "authors": ["Rami Bahsoon", "Wolfgang Emmerich", "Jonathan Macke"], "n_citation": 34, "references": ["02426ca1-b6f8-4880-912c-a0b841bbf4c9", "259f0d7f-39d9-43d8-bc80-e2b0ad9e040c", "2668c52b-7573-4b90-9975-0f76504d6e51", "36b1da11-d1c4-426f-a0e5-9073941cf261", "374720f5-35ca-451b-a4c1-7674d33b0121", "3a138aca-60f4-4d9c-a622-60b4c2f52339", "4195019a-8182-4ee9-9f6e-6a1c818bef07", "65acba26-3449-48c8-ac84-83465430d11b", "69220232-821f-4e21-8d99-3decfb2f9da6", "75986766-4d7a-4063-b5b6-fd5f05e88766", "835f8a45-88f8-437a-a065-8adb7898ff2d", "8823fb70-1ee5-49f3-8875-4306a133038d", "946be971-6e11-40f5-baaa-bc36f9ac72d3", "b54d2959-55a5-4d4c-bf67-9ebf2a1e61f3", "b7668ffb-c23b-43bb-8463-6bb56ff237dd", "b9d41432-f0fd-4eee-a600-c2de5f6e9aa2", "c79c9916-43b4-4fbb-867b-5af47fa33786", "cb0f1186-5ef9-4504-b72b-75d1161341c2", "d2656a82-90a0-4cbd-908c-62ba1b03c64f", "d63dd4ae-4b30-484b-8ffc-88d21839ddad", "d6ce7cf9-f091-4310-8868-4439f383e16c", "f51499e1-106b-476a-8f66-d765fd290de8", "f796ac80-d837-4256-af3e-f44b271daa46"], "title": "Using real options to select stable middleware-induced software architectures", "venue": "Iee Proceedings-software", "year": 2005, "id": "d9c9d4a1-938b-4c50-bbe3-f45e29f9e344"}
{"abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The study was designed to show how driver attention to the road scene and engagement of a choice of secondary tasks are affected by the level of automation provided to assist or take over the basic task of vehicle control. It was also designed to investigate the difference between support in longitudinal control and support in lateral control. BACKGROUND: There is comparatively little literature on the implications of automation for drivers' engagement in the driving task and for their willingness to engage in non-driving-related activities. METHOD: A study was carried out on a high-level driving simulator in which drivers experienced three levels of automation: manual driving, semiautomated driving with either longitudinal or lateral control provided, and highly automated driving with both longitudinal and lateral control provided. Drivers were free to pay attention to the roadway and traffic or to engage in a range of entertainment and grooming tasks. RESULTS: Engagement in the nondriving tasks increased from manual to semiautomated driving and increased further with highly automated driving. There were substantial differences in attention to the road and traffic between the two types of semiautomated driving. CONCLUSION: The literature on automation and the various task analyses of driving do not currently help to explain the effects that were found. Lateral support and longitudinal support may be the same in terms of levels of automation but appear to be regarded rather differently by drivers.

{"abstract": "We consider dynamic routing and power allocation for a wireless network with time-varying channels. The network consists of power constrained nodes that transmit over wireless links with adaptive transmission rates. Packets randomly enter the system at each node and wait in output queues to be transmitted through the network to their destinations. We establish the capacity region of all rate matrices (/spl lambda//sub ij/) that the system can stably support-where /spl lambda//sub ij/ represents the rate of traffic originating at node i and destined for node j. A joint routing and power allocation policy is developed that stabilizes the system and provides bounded average delay guarantees whenever the input rates are within this capacity region. Such performance holds for general arrival and channel state processes, even if these processes are unknown to the network controller. We then apply this control algorithm to an ad hoc wireless network, where channel variations are due to user mobility. Centralized and decentralized implementations are compared, and the stability region of the decentralized algorithm is shown to contain that of the mobile relay strategy developed by Grossglauser and Tse (2002).", "authors": ["Michael J.

The basic idea is to embed a finite field into a cyclotomic ring which is based on the elegant multiplicative structure of a cyclic group. One important feature of our architectures is that they provide area-time trade-offs which enable us to implement the multipliers in a partial-parallel/hybrid fashion. This hybrid architecture has great significance in its VLSI implementation in very large fields. The squaring operation using the redundant representation is simply a permutation of the coordinates. It is shown that, when there is an optimal normal basis, the proposed bit-serial and hybrid multiplier architectures have very low space complexity. Constant multiplication is also considered and is shown to have an advantage in using the redundant representation.", "authors": ["Huapeng Wu", "M.A. Hasan", "Ian F.

The idea is that actions which are not dependent (intuitively because they share no common resources) do not have to wait for one another to proceed, even if they are composed sequentially. Such a notion has been studied before in a linear-time setting, but until recently there has been no systematic investigation in the context of process algebras.#N##N#We give a structural operational semantics for a process algebraic language containing such a sequential composition operator, which shows some interesting interplay with choice. We give a complete axiomatisation of strong bisimilarity and we show consistency of the operational semantics with an event-based denotational semantics developed recently by the second author.

{"abstract": "We present a simple new construction of a pseudorandom bit generator. It stretches a short string of truly random bits into a long string that looks random to any algorithm from a complexity class C (e.g., P, NC, PSPACE, ...) using an arbitrary function that is hard for C. This construction reveals an equivalence between the problem of proving lower bounds and the problem of generating good pseudorandom sequences. Our construction has many consequences. The most direct one is that efficient deterministic simulation of randomized algorithms is possible under much weaker assumptions than previously known. The efficiency of the simulations depends on the strength of the assumptions, and may achieve P = BPP. We believe that our results are very strong evidence that the gap between randomized and deterministic complexity is not large. Using the known lower bounds for constant depth circuits, our construction yields an unconditionally proven pseudorandom generator for constant depth circuits.

{"abstract": "Cluster analysis of DNA microarray data is an important but difficult task in knowledge discovery processes. Many clustering methods are applied to analysis of data for gene expression, but none of them is able to deal with an absolute way with the challenges that this technology raises. Due to this, many applications have been developed for visually representing clustering algorithm results on DNA microarray data, usually providing dendrogram and heat map visualizations. Most of these applications focus only on the above visualizations, and do not offer further visualization components to the validate the clustering methods or to validate one another. This paper proposes using a visual analytics framework in cluster analysis of gene expression data. Additionally, it presents a new method for finding cluster boundaries based on properties of metric spaces. Our approach presents a set of visualization components able to interact with each other; namely, parallel coordinates, cluster boundary genes, 3D cluster surfaces and DNA microarray visualizations as heat maps. Experimental results have shown that our framework can be very useful in the process of more fully understanding DNA microarray data.

{"abstract": "Today, most developers work in parallel inside private workspaces to ensure stability during programming, but this provokes isolation from what co-workers are doing. Isolation may result in conflicts, which must be detected as early as possible to avoid bugs and expensive rework. Currently, frequent integration and awareness are used for early conflict detection. Frequent integration detects actual conflicts using automated builds, although only when merging checked in changes. Awareness informs about ongoing changes in private workspaces, however developers must find actual conflicts by themselves.   This paper proposes the novel concept of  real-time integration . This automates the detection of actual conflicts emerging during programming, involving checked in and ongoing changes, and affecting two or more developers. Cooperative resolution of conflicts is explicitly supported by sharing fine-grained changes among private workspaces.

{"abstract": "We present a new bicriteria approximation algorithm for the degree-bounded minimum-cost spanning tree problem: Given an undirected graph with nonnegative edge weights and degree bounds B v  > 1 for all vertices  v , find a spanning tree T of minimum total edge-cost such that the maximum degree of each node v in T is at most B v . Our algorithm finds a tree in which the degree of each node v is O(B v  + log n) and the total edge-cost is at most a constant times the cost of any tree that obeys all degree constraints.Our previous algorithm[9] with similar guarantees worked only in the case of uniform degree bounds (i.e. B v =B for all vertices  v ). While the new algorithm is based on ideas from Lagrangean relaxation as is our previous work, it does not rely on computing a solution to a linear program. Instead it uses a repeated application of Kruskal's MST algorithm interleaved with a combinatorial update of approximate Lagrangean node-multipliers maintained by the algorithm. These updates cause subsequent repetitions of the spanning tree algorithm to run for longer and longer times, leading to overall progress and a proof of the performance guarantee.", "authors": ["Jochen K\u00f6nemann", "R.

{"abstract": "We consider a class of multi-robot motion plan- ning problems where each robot is associated with multiple objectives and decoupled task specifications. The problems are formulated as an open-loop non-cooperative differential game. A distributed anytime algorithm is proposed to compute a Nash equilibrium of the game. The following properties are proven: (i) the algorithm asymptotically converges to the set of Nash equilibrium; (ii) for scalar cost functionals, the price of stability equals one; (iii) for the worst case, the computational complexity and communication cost are linear in the robot number. I. INTRODUCTION Robotic motion planning is a fundamental problem where a control sequence is found to steer a robot from the initial state to the goal set, while enforcing the environmental rules. It is well-known that the problem is computationally challenging (23). The situation is even worse for multi- robot motion planning since the computational complexity exponentially grows as the robot number. For multi-robot motion planning, non-cooperative game theoretic controller synthesis is interesting in two aspects: descriptive and perspective. From the descriptive point of view, Nash equilibrium is desirable in inherently competitive scenarios. More specifically, Nash equilibrium characterizes the stable scenarios among inherently self-interested players where none can benefit from unilateral deviations. From the perspective point of view, non-cooperative game theoretic learning holds the promise of providing computationally efficient algorithms for multi-robot controllers where the robots are assumed to be self-interested. Although Nash equilibrium may not be socially optimal, game theoretic approaches remain useful when the computational efficiency dominates. There have been limited results on rigorous analysis of game theoretic controller synthesis for multi-robot motion planning. The paper (19) tackles multi-robot motion planning in the framework of feedback differential games. However, it lacks of the rigorous analysis of the algorithm's convergence and computational complexity. In addition, static game the- ory has been used to synthesize distributed control schemes", "authors": ["Minghui Zhu", "Michael W.

{"abstract": "Sequential action control (SAC) is a recently developed algorithm for optimal control of nonlinear systems. Previous work by the authors demonstrates that SAC performs well on several benchmark control problems. This work demonstrates applicability of SAC to a variety of robotic systems; we show that SAC can also be easily applied to hybrid systems without any modification and that its scalability facilitates application to high-dimensional systems. First, SAC is applied to a popular hybrid dynamic running model known as the spring-loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP). The results show that SAC can achieve dynamic hopping without using prescribed touchdown angles/leg stiffness. Moreover no specialized hybrid methods are necessary to handle the contact dynamics, despite the nonsmooth nature of the problem. The same SAC-controlled SLIP model is also implemented in a game for the Android operating system, demonstrating the minimal computational requirements for implementing SAC. Our second example involves successful stabilization and tracking control of a nonlinear, constrained dynamic model of a humanoid marionette with 56 states and 8 inputs. Finally, a discussion that includes best practices on tuning parameters of the SAC algorithm as well as the challenges of hardware implementation is also provided, along with a video that shows the resulting simulations for each example.", "authors": ["Emmanouil Tzorakoleftherakis", "Alex Ansari", "Andrew D.

{"abstract": "In the letter the problem of cooperative spectrum sensing is investigated in cognitive radio (CR) networks over Rayleigh fading channels. By taking into account the error effect on the decision reporting, a general performance analysis of cooperative spectrum sensing is given. The analytical detection results show that the performance of cooperative spectrum sensing is limited by the probability of reporting errors. To deal with this limitation, we propose a transmit diversity based cooperative spectrum sensing method. By regarding multiple CRs as a virtual antenna array, space-time coding and space-frequency coding are applied into CR networks over flat-fading and frequency-selective fading channels, respectively. Moreover, we propose a relay diversity based cooperative spectrum sensing approach to increase the diversity of detection when some CRs are in heavy shadowing. It is then shown that, when combined with algebraic coding, relay diversity can further improve the cooperative spectrum sensing performance.", "authors": ["Wei Zhang", "Khaled Ben Letaief"], "n_citation": 361, "references": ["22ddd3a6-7516-4cce-858f-d31b9d82fda5", "68f3a7d4-d842-4d5f-ab20-f20b8a43444d", "ae181a84-6fa8-40d4-bd5c-6edd37ff114b", "b8b95e2e-7a6e-4688-9788-5e5b350f4275", "c09e7e8c-7af4-43f2-ba40-e066ecf67e02", "d1ba534e-3f80-4366-bb83-be16006f9e18", "e6a15cfd-755e-4f05-b47c-e77190473a9b", "f1e74152-3f7c-4c44-b628-cdf47a17587f"], "title": "Cooperative spectrum sensing with transmit and relay diversity in cognitive radio networks - [transaction letters]", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "year": 2008, "id": "07d23b40-c838-45bc-919f-accf8b8e59e9"}

{"abstract": "The successful deployment of next-generation distributed multimedia systems is significantly dependent on the efficient management support that improves the performance and reliability of such applications at run-time. In this paper, we describe an active management framework based on programmable monitoring agents and event-filter-action recursive model. Active management enables users to define reconfigurable and self-directed monitoring tasks that can be automatically customized at run-time in order to track the system behavior. Using this active management framework, the monitoring agents can be programmed to modify their monitoring tasks dynamically based on observed events information, and initiate the appropriate management actions accordingly. This paper also emphasizes the importance of active management for supporting a scalable, highly responsive and nonintrusive distributed management infrastructure. The presented framework, which is referred to as HiFi monitoring system, supports a comprehensive environment including code instrumentation, user subscription, agents administration, event filtering and action service.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we construct blind steganalyzers for JPEG images capable of assigning stego images to known steganographic programs. Each JPEG image is characterized using 23 calibrated features calculated from the luminance component of the JPEG file. Most of these features are calculated directly from the quantized DCT coefficients as their first order and higher-order statistics. The features for cover images and stego images embedded with three different relative message lengths are then used for supervised training. We use a support vector machine (SVM) with Gaussian kernel to construct a set of binary classifiers. The binary classifiers are then joined into a multi-class SVM using the Max-Win algorithm. We report results for six popular JPEG steganographic schemes (F5, OutGuess, Model based steganography, Model based steganography with deblocking, JP Hide&Seek, and Steghide). Although the main bulk of results is for single compressed stego images, we also report some preliminary results for double-compressed images created using F5 and OutGuess. This paper demonstrates that it is possible to reliably classify stego images to their embedding techniques. Moreover, this approach shows promising results for tackling the difficult case of double compressed images.", "authors": ["Tom\u00e1s Pevn\u00fd", "Jessica J.

{"abstract": "A non-work-conserving server is one that may be idle even when there are packets available to be sent. Since they do not provide the optimal average performance, non-work-conserving disciplines were seldom studied in the past. For the guaranteed performance service class in integrated services networks, the main performance index is the end-to-end delay bound, instead of the average delay. Providing end-to-end delay bounds in a networking environment is difficult. While bounding delay in any server requires a bound on the input traffic, complex interactions among traffic streams usually distort the traffic pattern, so that traffic inside the network is different from the source traffic. Previous techniques of bounding end-to-end delay in a networking environment usually start from the source traffic characterizations and iteratively 'push' the traffic characterizations through the network. This not only requires non-trivial analysis, but also has several important limitations. In this paper, we show that non-work-conserving disciplines greatly simplify the analysis in a networking environment, and overcome most of the limitations of previous work by controlling traffic distortion inside the network, thus allowing a single node analysis to be extended to arbitrary topology networks.", "authors": ["Hui Zhang"], "n_citation": 77, "references": ["0dd76688-5c28-45e2-acae-ececbb352f82", "12db5aab-fc87-43cb-a6a1-9f541c76799d", "1381eac0-472f-41e7-b8be-4a92962648d3", "2a8a5732-d3c3-4ec7-acde-f1a7b0e47115", "3194faee-2398-4d19-b9da-1e3fbfbe1d64", "449649af-a08c-4c0d-9f79-dc8c946eee0f", "549920b9-6006-4752-a867-4157cfec9284", "55215737-055a-4f97-99d0-f8482efaef24", "7966b1a7-c08a-4af7-9f00-0d4eee274215", "7c13179e-3937-4803-95c6-565d57f21b38", "913cc94b-97b7-46a2-9d5c-2f51f3b323a2", "a65559af-1bdd-4fac-81f3-0082bb992f00", "b3316d76-da95-4f96-b10f-6f70089d3485", "c8040763-7a4d-45fc-93d2-fecdb7064a77", "e14e0229-fad9-43e5-b29d-a0ec95ed7536", "fab6340c-b4eb-4988-b77a-719bce44f145"], "title": "Providing end-to-end performance guarantees using non-work-conserving disciplines", "venue": "Computer Communications", "year": 1995, "id": "51d1a61b-f364-48d3-9109-2ca01905e1c2"}
{"abstract": "The structure from motion problem has been extensively studied in the field of computer vision. Yet, the bulk of the existing work assumes that the scene contains only a single moving object. The more realistic case where an unknown number of objects move in the scene has received little attention, especially for its theoretical treatment. We present a new method for separating and recovering the motion and shape of multiple independently moving objects in a sequence of images. The method does not require prior knowledge of the number of objects, nor is dependent on any grouping of features into an object at the image level. For this purpose, we introduce a mathematical construct of object shapes, called the shape interaction matrix, which is invariant to both the object motions and the selection of coordinate systems. This invariant structure is computable solely from the observed trajectories of image features without grouping them into individual objects. Once the structure is computed, it allows for segmenting features into objects by the process of transforming it into a canonical form, as well as recovering the shape and motion of each object. >", "authors": ["Jo\u00e3o Paulo Costeira", "Takeo Kanade"], "n_citation": 249, "references": ["125a278c-e88e-4818-b082-8e02b619253e", "17b3a4ad-de77-4d73-be7c-d2068b51924b", "457faa7a-3288-4088-a140-a6c03a10cf01", "8b9abcea-b1a4-4e44-b964-be932ef29ef1", "905461e4-643b-4da0-a669-f52318b9e126", "976eff9e-bbb1-41aa-bf35-60273c072ca0", "9a1967e7-a302-4f6d-bc3d-6457f086e8a5", "bba1e0d9-2c67-4b68-9c65-f947f0707a1f", "f284ee4f-4600-40ce-9bfd-424664b2529b"], "title": "A multi-body factorization method for motion analysis", "venue": "international conference on computer vision", "year": 1995, "id": "2e1d6310-46b9-400f-bfe4-9de099193cd1"}

This camera geometry transformation together with the planar motion constraint will: 1) eliminate the ambiguity between rotational and translation ego-motion parameters, and 2) improve the Hessian matrix condition in the direct motion estimation process. The virtual downward-looking camera enables us to estimate the planar ego-motions even for small image patches. Such local measurements are then combined together, by a robust weighting scheme based on both ground plane geometry and motion compensated intensity residuals, for a global ego-motion estimation and ground plane detection. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by experiments on both synthetic and real data.", "authors": ["Qifa Ke", "Takeo Kanade"], "n_citation": 97, "references": ["050a184c-1203-4e94-8da1-7dee5ced9777", "0c7c7fe9-5688-4b80-885b-cbdd174463c1", "3654c18b-95e8-495c-85f7-62510befa795", "45a0860c-659e-4a3d-b3b9-d8f44444d094", "4887e883-7135-42bf-a61e-93e4f6506941", "6085f8fa-0f80-4bf9-9fc3-cb177adaba35", "65528efd-326c-4fb9-bfef-a43093b553cd", "7280c0c6-1f2b-4566-994d-6c8a21998a60", "7345e129-8b63-4661-b924-f423880d62f0", "78c18ee9-4363-4dcc-a6a3-ca9d5a747318", "86b6c7d4-1f67-4e7d-b36b-2990dbb30414", "8f9d2434-c08a-43e5-8152-d41f2784ddc2", "9a1967e7-a302-4f6d-bc3d-6457f086e8a5", "9dee56d9-8fd5-414c-83ae-31551b20ae88", "a7da5f11-1302-4305-a67a-9503dea05eb7", "b9fa1cc4-f358-4c0f-82ad-3ca72301498f", "bd1498bd-791c-4875-90fa-0acbb5e7baa3", "cfffc6a8-e275-4513-9a4c-9236f0a0bd20", "d285cffc-b94d-4f81-bb6a-51ca70d95f75", "ea918d26-cd76-4aa3-9064-de9bb7247ecd", "fc75bf11-964d-47cf-8796-9483325b55f5"], "title": "Transforming camera geometry to a virtual downward-looking camera: robust ego-motion estimation and ground-layer detection", "venue": "computer vision and pattern recognition", "year": 2003, "id": "abfb71b4-48b8-4517-9cbc-cdc85a26d6e8"}

{"abstract": "Java PathFinder (JPF) is a popular model checker for Java programs. JPF was used to generate object graphs as test inputs for object-oriented programs.\u00a0\u00a0Specifically, JPF was used as an implementation engine for the Korat algorithm. Korat takes two inputs---a Java predicate that encodes properties of desired object graphs and a bound on the size of the graph---and generates all graphs (within the given bound) that satisfy the encoded properties. Korat uses a systematic search to explore the bounded state space of object graphs.\u00a0\u00a0Korat search was originally implemented in JPF using a simple instrumentation of the Java predicate. However, JPF is a general-purpose model checker and such direct implementation results in an unnecessarily slow search. We present our results on speeding up Korat search in JPF.

{"abstract": "We present the design and analysis of an Agile All-Photonic Network (AAPN); in the context of our study, the agility is derived from sub-microsecond photonic switching and global network synchronization. We have articulated a set of circuit design alternatives in terms of switch configurations referred to as symmetric and asymmetric designs, and two-layer and three-layer designs and discuss the implications of these alternatives in terms of transmitter and receiver design and synchronization requirements. In order to evaluate performance and cost of this range of design alternatives, we developed a set of software tools and methodologies for designing and dimensioning our vision of an AAPN. The topological design problem consists of determining the optimal number, size and placement of edge nodes, selector/ multiplexers and core switches as well as the placement of the DWDM links so as to minimize network costs while satisfying performance requirements of the supported traffic. A new mixed integer linear programming formulation is presented for core node placement and link connectivity. A methodology has been developed for two-layer and three-layer network topology design and implemented in software. These tools were exercised under a wide variety of equipment cost assumptions for both a metropolitan network and a long-haul network assuming a gravity model for traffic distribution and a fiat community of interest factor. Key findings include the determination of near cost optimal designs for both metropolitan (two-layer design) and a Canadian wide area network (WAN, three-layer design). We also show the cost and topology sensitivity to the selector switch size and the preferred size in terms of port count and number of switches.", "authors": ["Lorne G. Mason", "A. L.

Some interesting features of this UIMS are interactive screen and menu layout, support for three dialogue notations, flexible interface to the application program, ability to adapt to different users, and the use of concurrent processes in user interface implementation The techniques used in the implementation of this UIMS are discussed.", "authors": ["Mark Green"], "n_citation": 156, "references": ["3be79e06-5ea6-4abb-b165-5135ab469c49", "48be1b3e-af2d-42ba-b4ab-a33599d936ac", "50689679-8346-48f2-8d70-4dfd29f8b470", "577dad51-cc83-456b-8b17-7870c59a6996", "5b1eafa6-0b05-41de-aba1-0d5476cb4b66", "8aa57ab8-5135-4d74-8791-07fe51486a57", "f667196c-5549-4454-97cd-52170eb6af66"], "title": "The University of Alberta user interface management system", "venue": "international conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques", "year": 1985, "id": "4c50dae5-23d4-4f39-8c7e-349e558a6fb6"}
{"abstract": "This paper examines the role of computer-aided systems (CAS) for enhancing organizational learning in distributed environments. The basic research questions are: how do features of CAS enhance organizational learning, and how does organizational context influence the role of CAS in organizational learning?The theoretical framework focuses on the decision to contribute and adopt knowledge in distributed environments. Specifically, we investigate the intersections between the features of CAS and inhibitors to contributing or adopting knowledge, in the light of different organizational context variables.Two cases of information environments for knowledge sharing are examined: a formal electronic library system and an informal community that uses a variety of communication technologies. The cases are used to illustrate how the intersection between CAS features and the decisions to adopt and contribute enhance or inhibit knowledge sharing.", "authors": ["Paul S. Goodman", "Eric D.

{"abstract": "The emerging technology of group support systems has the potential to enhance the effectivenss of team work in organizations. One critical factor that has received little attention in technology-supported environments is that of the roles that participants fill in meetings. This paper develops a theoretical model of roles in computer-supported meetings and examines the impact of a group support system on roles. An exploratory field study of 10 work teams was conducted to investigate the perceptions of participants about their own roles and the roles that the group support system technology might fill. The study found a gap between the role expectations of meeting initiators and meeting participants, as well as between participants' role expectations and actual roles filled. The group support system technology was perceived to fill an unexpectedly large variety of roles. The study also showed that the group support system assumed some of the roles that participants expected to fill, resulting in fewer roles filled by participants.", "authors": ["Ilze Zigurs", "Kenneth A.

Data for the study was obtained from event logs collected over a six-month period from the mail routing network of a commercial organization. The study focuses on characterizing causes of machine reboots. The key observations from this study are: 1) most of the problems that lead to reboots are software related; 2) rebooting the machine does not always solve the problem; 3) there are indications of propagated or correlated failures; and 4) though the average availability evaluates to over 99%, the machine downtime lasts (on average) two hours. Since the machines are dedicated mail servers, bringing down one or more of them can potentially disrupt storage, forwarding, reception and delivery of mail.

{"abstract": "Multi-tasking is a common activity for computer users. Recent computer-based approaches to help support a user in multi-tasking require the user to indicate the start (and at least implicitly) end points of tasks manually. Although there has been some work aimed at inferring the boundaries of a user's tasks, it is not yet robust enough to replace the manual approach. Unfortunately, with the manual approach, a user can sometimes forget to identify a task boundary, leading to erroneous information being associated with a task or appropriate information being missed. These problems degrade the effectiveness of the multi-tasking support. In this paper, we describe two interfaces we designed to support task boundary identification. One interface stresses the use of episodic memory for recalling the boundary of a task; the other stresses the use of semantic memory. We investigate these interfaces in the context of software development. We report on an exploratory study of the use of these two interfaces by twelve programmers. We found that the programmers determined task boundaries more accurately with the episodic memory-based interface and that this interface was also strongly preferred.", "authors": ["Izzet Safer", "Gail C.

Such goals can be refined through refinement methods and can be evaluated in order to determine the degree to which a set of nonfunctional requirements is supported by a particular design. Evidence for the power of the framework is provided through the study of accuracy and performance requirements for information systems. >", "authors": ["John Mylopoulos", "Lawrence Chung", "Brian A.

{"abstract": "Software contracts take the form of routine preconditions, postconditions, and class invariants written into the program itself. The design by contract methodology uses such contracts for building each software element, an approach that is particularly appropriate for developing safety-critical software and reusable libraries. This methodology is a key design element of some existing libraries, especially the Eiffel Software development environment, which incorporates contract mechanisms in the programming language itself. Because the authors see the contract metaphor as inherent to quality software development, they undertook the work reported in the article as a sanity check to determine whether they see contracts everywhere simply because their development environment makes using them natural or whether contracts are intrinsically present, even when other designers don't express or even perceive them. They studied classes from the .NET collections library for implicit contracts and assessed improvements that might result from making them explicit.", "authors": ["K. Arnou", "B.

{"abstract": "Recent research shows that rule based models perform well while classifying large data sets such as data streams with concept drifts. A genetic algorithm is a strong rule based classification algorithm which is used only for mining static small data sets. If the genetic algorithm can be made scalable and adaptable by reducing its I/O intensity, it will become an efficient and effective tool for mining large data sets like data streams. In this paper a scalable and adaptable online genetic algorithm is proposed to mine classification rules for the data streams with concept drifts. Since the data streams are generated continuously in a rapid rate, the proposed method does not use a fixed static data set for fitness calculation. Instead, it extracts a small snapshot of the training example from the current part of data stream whenever data is required for the fitness calculation. The proposed method also builds rules for all the classes separately in a parallel independent iterative manner. This makes the proposed method scalable to the data streams and also adaptable to the concept drifts that occur in the data stream in a fast and more natural way without storing the whole stream or a part of the stream in a compressed form as done by the other rule based algorithms. The results of the proposed method are comparable with the other standard methods which are used for mining the data streams.", "authors": ["P. Vivekanandan", "R.

{"abstract": "This paper describes a domain-independent, automatically trained natural language call router for directing incoming calls in a call center. Our call router directs customer calls based on their response to an open-ended How may I direct your call? prompt. Routing behavior is trained from a corpus of transcribed and hand-routed calls and then carried out using vector-based information retrieval techniques. Terms consist of n-gram sequences of morphologically reduced content words, while documents representing routing destinations consist of weighted term frequencies derived from calls to that destination in the training corpus. Based on the statistical discriminating power of the n-gram terms extracted from the caller's request, the caller is 1) routed to the appropriate destination, 2) transferred to a human operator, or 3) asked a disambiguation question. In the last case, the system dynamically generates queries tailored to the caller's request and the destinations with which it is consistent, based on our extension of the vector model. Evaluation of the call router performance over a financial services call center using both accurate transcriptions of calls and fairly noisy speech recognizer output demonstrated robustness in the face of speech recognition errors. More specifically, using accurate transcriptions of speech input, our system correctly routed 93.8% of the calls after redirecting 10.2% of all calls to a human operator. Using speech recognizer output with a 23% error rate reduced the number of correctly routed calls by 4%.", "authors": ["Jennifer Chu-Carroll", "Bob Carpenter"], "n_citation": 199, "references": ["17142141-3e5f-48c2-a002-1a7dbff572c4", "17b30a13-16a0-4a74-8975-a642220cc8c8", "1ee99b1b-7238-4b39-95d5-40a9808cf3c1", "45a71e06-0683-49e4-9969-0fc799fd992f", "69083cb9-a7ec-460a-9122-a2c7afb84767", "6f028c66-65d6-4520-9428-4bc83149ff96", "887d541a-1d08-4aba-a01f-e9de1f08d986", "ac14afe6-de4d-4056-b2ac-0f6e36f369a2", "b85d2dfb-3bbd-4559-a45a-8b11b936ea22", "b9111683-1151-4542-8a10-d1eeb730087e", "c1310579-5831-4d97-b08f-0e82a4ab6398", "c246e2d3-e94f-49e0-b1ce-a76e8b064ece", "ed660ea2-fad8-4bd1-8c0b-8c0679eb1657", "fc24a115-5f3e-4479-9d64-9202ca6c8bab"], "title": "Vector-based natural language call routing", "venue": "Computational Linguistics", "year": 1999, "id": "ee26690e-ce54-4d57-beed-c7727e42b21e"}

{"abstract": "Studies have shown that users have difficulty in using the many different search systems of library catalogs. This is because users do not possess the knowledge and skills that librarians have for performing searches on the catalogs. With the growth of the Internet, more libraries are offering their services online including the information in the catalog systems. In the library premises, users can seek the help of Librarians in carrying out their searches on the catalogs. However, such assistance is usually not available over the Internet for practical reasons. With an electronic referencer playing the role of a Librarian, users can get similar assistance and conduct more effective searches of the catalogs over the Internet. This paper describes the design and implementation of an electronic referencer known as the E-Referencer. It is a web-based interface developed to help users achieve more effective searches in online catalogs. It does so by capturing the expert knowledge of librarians (in the form of search strategies) into its knowledge base, and selecting and using them in helping users retrieve relevant records. The E-Referencer system is implemented using the JESS expert system shell and uses the Z39.50 protocol to access library databases on the Internet. The results of a test conducted to study the effectiveness of the system using a small sample of twelve queries are presented.", "authors": ["Danny Chiang Choon Poo", "Teck-Kang Toh", "Christopher S.

{"abstract": "The k-Local Hamiltonian problem is a natural complete problem for the complexity class QMA, the quantum analog of NP. It is similar in spirit to MAX-k-SAT, which is NP-complete for k \u2265 2. It was known that the problem is QMA-complete for any k \u2265 3. On the other hand 1-Local Hamiltonian is in P, and hence not believed to be QMA-complete. The complexity of the 2-Local Hamiltonian problem has long been outstanding. Here we settle the question and show that it is QMA-complete. We provide two independent proofs; our first proof uses a powerful technique for analyzing the sum of two Hamiltonians; this technique is based on perturbation theory and we believe that it might prove useful elsewhere. The second proof uses elementary linear algebra only. Using our techniques we also show that adiabatic computation with two-local interactions on qubits is equivalent to standard quantum computation.", "authors": ["Julia Kempe", "Alexei Kitaev", "Oded Regev"], "n_citation": 157, "references": ["6f465197-a212-4353-b946-df7629a9fbc0", "95308aac-2a69-48bc-97b5-587488e783a3", "9780fde9-66f8-4922-99ac-f95f4509c9e7", "9dd4cc9b-0a7c-462e-b331-0abffe325ec2"], "title": "The complexity of the local hamiltonian problem", "venue": "foundations of software technology and theoretical computer science", "year": 2004, "id": "44b80390-3cc7-4f2f-bc93-40ef0ce8704f"}
{"abstract": "The most efficient planning algorithms recently developed are mainly based on Graphplan system or on satisfiability approach. In this paper we present a new approach to plan generation based on planning graph analysis, which can be considered as a bridge between the two planning approaches. The method exploits the propagation of planning axioms and constraints in order to make deductions on the planning graph and therefore to prune the search space. The consequences of decisions made during search have backward and furward impact on the planning graph. In contrast with Graphplan based backward algorithms, our approach allows to search the planning graph without committing to any specific direction. The experimental results obtained with DPPlan, a planner implementing the presented propagation approach by systematic search, are encouraging even if compared with approaches based on SAT. DPPian has not the huge memory requirements as SAT solvers and keeps a strong connection with the planning problem allowing the development of search strategies which incorporate domain dependent heuristics.

This work addresses the representation of moving objects on GIS.  The continuous nature of movement raises problems for representation in information systems due to the limited capacity of storage systems and the inherently discrete nature of measurement instruments. The stored information has therefore to be partial and does not allow an exact inference of the real-world object's behavior. To cope with this, query operations must take uncertainty into consideration in their semantics in order to give accurate answers to the users.  The paper proposes a set of operations to be included in a GIS or a spatial database to make it able to answer queries on the spatio-temporal behavior of moving objects. The operations have been selected according to the requirements of real applications and their semantics with respect to uncertainty is specified. A collection of examples from a case study is included to illustrate the expressiveness of the proposed operations.", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Moreira", "Cristina Ribeiro", "Talel Abdessalem"], "n_citation": 38, "references": ["164ed748-c71e-4700-83d3-9b09ccf63825", "42b33af3-c669-4b4e-b137-24ddfed1172e", "5c69bfd0-8cc4-4142-9d6e-6f39ec874081", "6ef462ef-3cac-45f6-b43c-01f4c6644000", "85c7b0b4-a874-48d2-9292-0ccd7d3e7274", "8b2275b9-fd7f-41ba-9925-3e28bccc7d62", "90d8a2e9-8a23-4a0b-ab32-0a41ed1c6611", "ae3ea321-d857-4f6d-a6f2-cf27993c3b47", "dffd4ee1-471c-4602-a77e-72e0027b736d"], "title": "Query operations for moving objects database systems", "venue": "advances in geographic information systems", "year": 2000, "id": "7f6c80c8-bbc8-4b72-af67-b7138648dfea"}

{"abstract": "The paper describes a composite evolution approach which integrates the evolution of the various types of entities in an object-oriented database into one model. The approach provides maintainers with a coherent and comprehensible view of the system and at the same time maintains change histories at a fine granularity. Links among meta-objects are implemented using dynamic relationships which are semantic constructs and first-class objects. Referential integrity is maintained by the relationships architecture reducing the evolution complexity at the meta-object level. A customisable and exchangeable instance adaptation approach is proposed. The approach is based on separating the instance adaptation code from class versions using aspects, abstractions used in Aspect-Oriented Programming to localise crosscutting concerns. A high level object-oriented model offering transparent access to the proposed evolution functionality is provided.", "authors": ["Awais Rashid"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["20753f95-f8b8-4b61-a9b1-eb4a8edd3842", "39c38da2-4770-4345-89ba-36269adb1c24", "3fac4a85-0bba-4a1c-aad5-759e2a0ce8c6", "4121a56a-19b4-4972-8fc7-e8d3eb887a86", "4126adbe-66e7-4f06-8f04-1a12ef6cfef9", "4681d2a2-359b-4ded-ba47-1889490c98ef", "4cbccc5e-54d2-41da-9cd3-a89169998ead", "5e19f6b4-7405-4868-bfe7-d50ee4d637a3", "b7638686-6870-4997-acae-68cfa48fadb9", "b9362399-f2d1-4136-9565-a5d21245aed9", "d8d16c96-cf0f-4315-a702-96ed438618c4", "e520ee12-4e7a-423b-a131-d07608947f73", "e7a7f939-5441-4413-9513-3ad492695a73", "ffb470af-c38d-44f4-bc1e-2717be28f454"], "title": "A database evolution approach for object-oriented databases", "venue": "international conference on software maintenance", "year": 2001, "id": "cbef87d4-1b59-45bf-88ca-6d2c1f5384f5"}
{"abstract": "End user programming (EUP) environments are difficult to evaluate empirically. Most users do not engage in programming, and those who do are often discouraged by the complexity of programming tasks. Often the difficulties arise from the programming languages in which users are expected to express themselves. But there are other difficulties associated with designing extensions and adjustments to artifacts that have been originally designed by others. This paper characterizes EUP as a semiotic design process, and presents two principles that can be used to illustrate the distinctions between the various kinds of techniques and approaches proposed in this field. The principles support a preliminary theoretical model of EUP and should thus facilitate the definition and interpretation of empirical evaluation studies. They also define some specific semiotic qualifications that more usable and applicable EUP languages could be expected to have. q 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

{"abstract": "We present a new model for testing real-time protocols with multiple timers, which captures complex timing dependencies by using simple linear expressions involving timer-related variables. This new modeling technique, combined with the algorithms to eliminate inconsistencies, allows generation of feasible test sequences without compromising their fault coverage. The model is specifically designed for testing to avoid performing full reachability analysis, and to control the growth of the number of test scenarios. Based on extended finite state machines, it is applicable to languages such as SDL, VHDL, and Estelle. The technique models a realistic testing framework in which each I/O exchange takes a certain time to realize and timers can be arbitrarily started or stopped.

{"abstract": "The success of online social networks has attracted a constant interest in attacking and exploiting them. Attackers usually control malicious accounts, including both fake and compromised real user accounts, to launch attack campaigns such as social spam, malware distribution, and online rating distortion. To defend against these attacks, we design and implement a malicious account detection system called SynchroTrap. We observe that malicious accounts usually perform loosely synchronized actions in a variety of social network context. Our system clusters user accounts according to the similarity of their actions and uncovers large groups of malicious accounts that act similarly at around the same time for a sustained period of time. We implement SynchroTrap as an incremental processing system on Hadoop and Giraph so that it can process the massive user activity data in a large online social network efficiently. We have deployed our system in five applications at Facebook and Instagram.

UWPI solves program illustration using compile-time pattern matching and type inferencing to link anticipated execution events to display events, rather than relying on user assistance or specialized programming techniques.

{"abstract": "Workflow technologies have become a major vehicle for easy and efficient development of scientific applications. In the meantime, state-of-the-art resource provisioning technologies such as cloud computing enable users to acquire computing resources dynamically and elastically. A critical challenge in integrating workflow technologies with resource provisioning technologies is to determine the right amount of resources required for the execution of workflows in order to minimize the financial cost from the perspective of users and to maximize the resource utilization from the perspective of resource providers. This paper suggests an architecture for the automatic execution of large-scale workflow-based applications on dynamically and elastically provisioned computing resources. Especially, we focus on its core algorithm named PBTS (Partitioned Balanced Time Scheduling), which estimates the minimum number of computing hosts required to execute a workflow within a user-specified finish time. The PBTS algorithm is designed to fit both elastic resource provisioning models such as Amazon EC2 and malleable parallel application models such as MapReduce. The experimental results with a number of synthetic workflows and several real science workflows demonstrate that PBTS estimates the resource capacity close to the theoretical low bound.", "authors": ["Eun-Kyu Byun", "Yang-Suk Kee", "Jin-Soo Kim", "Seungryoul Maeng"], "n_citation": 86, "references": ["0190eda7-905d-40bd-8b33-26a4aac0f217", "07bf4909-9b32-460b-8dc9-626ae1890d8c", "1117871f-c32d-42b0-9677-2f1659043012", "117d7c05-35c9-4745-bd6c-c745c35ec7eb", "137b4173-ab9d-4da3-94e1-9f330bcf1b7c", "1644ee57-5d35-4d98-a40e-06b6800a5634", "20832508-e7ef-4f75-bf87-5e522f70c9b7", "3006a216-950c-4c6a-81df-dee7f80ec75c", "3342e8e8-eab8-40dc-8bc1-95e79fccb7b0", "378254e5-0f41-43f5-89fc-8cef105ea0ab", "403f2b91-b8e8-461e-8a27-9b1cc5470dcd", "56eb93ed-44c1-48d1-9e87-84737d3ebddf", "59af7e25-c0ee-4af5-acea-a58dfe4ccac4", "71b9b7a4-43c0-4a36-8833-da3ffff05c3a", "7c9d8822-9433-49ce-991c-c36c6aeb128e", "854389d6-37fa-448e-af0a-5cc0fee6477d", "97494ea6-9990-4e51-9dc3-be867cf53d00", "9a2a4d3d-f4c2-43f4-ba6f-e09161e77ed8", "a83195ee-7253-40d8-af19-a44aaab47eae", "aed6e20c-87fc-4021-b333-d079ceac9220", "b33b96e1-99c7-427b-b349-905d53563cb7", "b570e9f7-e517-4e71-82cf-461cfe05e3b7", "e56cd5ec-f544-45d8-a9f6-5b706880871b", "eedb8cef-1e9d-4dce-8830-ff4f73280c23", "f984c248-820b-44e7-a5e4-1d72b3a4e412", "fb0a382c-a1f1-4f0c-8e80-36fe5fbbfb86"], "title": "Cost optimized provisioning of elastic resources for application workflows", "venue": "Future Generation Computer Systems", "year": 2011, "id": "ce264684-7a2b-493f-9336-3b68071ebca1"}

{"abstract": "Background: Meningitis is characterized by an inflammation of the meninges, or the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord. Early diagnosis and treatment is crucial for a positive outcome, yet identifying meningitis is a complex process involving an array of signs and symptoms and multiple causal factors which require novel solutions to support clinical decision-making. In this work, we explore the potential of fuzzy cognitive map to assist in the modeling of meningitis, as a support tool for physicians in the accurate diagnosis and treatment of the condition. Methods: Fuzzy cognitive mapping (FCM) is a method for analysing and depicting human perception of a given system. FCM facilitates the development of a conceptual model which is not limited by exact values and measurements and thus is well suited to representing relatively unstructured knowledge and associations expressed in imprecise terms. A team of doctors (physicians), comprising four paediatricians, was formed to define the multifarious signs and symptoms associated with meningitis and to identify risk factors integral to its causality, as indicators used by clinicians to identify the presence or absence of meningitis in patients. The FCM model, consisting of 20 concept nodes, has been designed by the team of paediatricians in collaborative dialogue with the research team. Results: The paediatricians were supplied with a form containing various input parameters to be completed at the time of diagnosing meningitis among infants and children. The paediatricians provided information on a total of 56 patient cases amongst children whose age ranged from 2 months to 7 years. The physicians\u2019 decision to diagnose meningitis was available for each individual case which was used as the outcome measure for evaluating the model. The FCM was trained using 40 cases with an accuracy of 95%, and later 16 test cases were used to analyze the accuracy and reliability of the model.

{"abstract": "MetaML is a multi-stage functional programming language featuring three constructs that can be viewed as statically-typed refinements of the back-quote, comma, and eval of Scheme. Thus it provides special support for writing code generators and serves as a semantically-sound basis for systems involving multiple interdependent computational stages. In previous work, we reported on an implementation of MetaML, and on a reduction semantics and type-system for MetaML. In this paper, we present An Idealized MetaML (AIM) that is the result of our study of a categorical model for MetaML. An important outstanding problem is finding a type system that provides the user with a means for manipulating both open and closed code. This problem has eluded efforts by us and other researchers for over three years. AIM solves the issue by providing two type constructors, one classifies closed code and the other open code, and exploiting the way they interact. We point out that AIM can be verbose, and outline a possible remedy relating to the strictness of the closed code type.", "authors": ["Eugenio Moggi", "Walid Taha", "Zine El-Abidine Benaissa", "Tim Sheard"], "n_citation": 99, "references": ["026b77b8-3fa8-4abf-a47b-83c7b0fc77f6", "26f0a85e-596c-432e-b360-d8c760a4b4d2", "2fdc6ecd-5ab3-4f07-8335-a5e184bc3554", "762667cb-4508-4cac-899b-a0cdf063f3b6", "95424e03-61ec-4760-a51f-c3bbf8f821ce", "9690965a-08c9-48c6-9f85-df6a192db1ee", "99ad7726-8c02-422c-8700-88c427a8a526", "abdd59da-98e1-4720-9c00-bdf6f98747f7", "d4f6ae5b-480a-4d66-9524-b8f897530aac", "fdce467b-dff6-440c-9fa7-f52cfc891b39"], "title": "An Idealized MetaML: Simpler, and More Expressive", "venue": "european symposium on programming", "year": 1999, "id": "f83f4f0c-6484-49fa-ae15-6ca7536fa35f"}
{"abstract": "Enhancing the connectivity of wireless sensor networks is necessary to avoid the occurrence of coverage gaps. In this paper, we aim at improving the network connectivity of a given network by adding a set of relays to it. We characterize the network connectivity by the Fiedler value, which is the second smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix representing the network graph. We propose a network-maintenance algorithm, which finds the best locations for a given set of relays. The proposed algorithm obtains the best relays' locations through a multi-level approach. In each level, the search problem can be formulated as a standard semi-definite programming (SDP) optimization problem.

{"abstract": "Visual motion boundaries provide a powerful cue for the perceptual organization of scenes. Motion boundaries are present when surfaces in motion occlude one another. Conventional approaches to motion analysis have relied on assumptions of data conservation and smoothness, which has made analysis of motion boundaries difficult. We show that a common source of motion boundary, kinetic occlusion, can be detected using spatiotemporal junction analysis. Junction analysis is accomplished by utilizing distributed representations of motion used in models of human visual motion sensing. By detecting changes in the direction of motion in these representations, spatiotemporal junctions are detected in a manner which differentiates accretion from deletion. We demonstrate successful occlusion detection on spatiotemporal imagery containing occluding surfaces in motion. >", "authors": ["Sourabh A.

{"abstract": "The Kerberos authentication system is based on the trusted third-party Needham-Schroeder (1978) authentication protocol. The system is one of the few industry standards for authentication systems and its use is becoming fairly widespread. The system has some limitations, many of which are traceable to the decision of the Kerberos designers to solely use symmetric key cryptosystems. Using asymmetric (public-key) cryptosystems in an authentication protocol would prevent some of the shortcomings. Several such protocols have been proposed and some have been implemented. However, all these designs are either completely different from the Kerberos system, or require major changes to the basic system. Any attempts to improve Kerberos would do so with only minimal impact to the protocol and the source tree. In this work, we describe Yaksha, a new approach to achieving these goals. Yaksha uses as its building block an RSA (Rivest, Shamir & Adelman, 1978) algorithm variant independently invented by Boyd (1989) and by Ganesan and Yacobi (1994), in which the RSA private key is split into two portions. One portion becomes a user's Yaksha password, and the other the Yaksha server's password for that user. Using this simple but useful primitive, we show how we can blend the Kerberos system with a public-key infrastructure to create Yaksha, a more secure version of Kerberos, with minimal changes to the protocol. >", "authors": ["Ravi Ganesan"], "n_citation": 45, "references": ["ab7c3e56-2475-48e6-95de-1558f3e123e4", "b55a6c56-02de-4ebc-84e0-78b75dbb7c9b", "cef4b1b3-d027-4b06-89cb-6ec680170cbc"], "title": "Yaksha: augmenting Kerberos with public key cryptography", "venue": "network and distributed system security symposium", "year": 1995, "id": "b467094d-177b-4704-855a-aa128ed9a58e"}

{"abstract": "Abstract   Virtually any desired time variation   V(t)   of the feedrate along a curved path can be realized by real-time CNC interpolator algorithms for the Pythagorean-hodograph (PH) curves: the only stipulation is that   V(t)   should admit a closed-form indefinite integral   F(t)  . Different feedrate variations   V(t)   can be accommodated with minimal modifications to the core algorithm by employing a modular function call to define   F(t)  .

Empirical results from implementations of these time-dependent feedrate interpolators on an open-architecture 3-axis mill are presented, highlighting their exceptional performance and versatility.

Together with Forte Design Systems, a fully automated approach was developed by integrating behavioral synthesis into the design flow. Starting from a behavioral SystemC model, hardware accelerators can be generated automatically using Forte Cynthesizer and can be added to the design space. The resulting design space is explored automatically by optimizing several objectives simultaneously using state of the art multi-objective optimization algorithms. As a result, SystemCoDesigner presents optimized hardware/software solutions to the designer who can select any of them for rapid prototyping on an FPGA basis.

This process is based on clustering the graph representing the modules and module-level dependencies found in the source code into abstract structures not in the source code called subsystems. The clustering process uses evolutionary algorithms to search through the enormous set of possible graph partitions, and is guided by a fitness function designed to measure the quality of individual graph partitions. The second part of this paper focuses on evaluating the results produced by our clustering technique. Our previous research has shown through both qualitative and quantitative studies that our clustering technique produces good results quickly and consistently.

It additionally suggests that the evaluation of the policies themselves adapt to perceived network threat conditions, possibly affected by the receipt of such audit data by other processes. Such advanced policies assist in detecting and responding to intrusion and misuse and they allow more efficient utilization of security services, such as authentication, audit, and notification.

{"abstract": "Abstract   Modern high-performance communication networks pose a number of challenging problems concerning the efficient allocation of resources to connection requests. In all-optical networks with wavelength-division multiplexing, connection requests must be assigned paths and colors (wavelengths) such that intersecting paths receive different colors, and the goal is to minimize the number of colors used. This path coloring problem is proved   NP  -hard for undirected and bidirected ring networks. Path coloring in undirected tree networks is shown to be equivalent to edge coloring of multigraphs, which implies a polynomial-time optimal algorithm for trees of constant degree as well as   NP  -hardness and an approximation algorithm with absolute approximation ratio   4  3   and asymptotic approximation ratio 1.1 for trees of arbitrary degree. For bidirected trees, path coloring is shown to be   NP  -hard even in the binary case. A polynomial-time optimal algorithm is given for path coloring in undirected or bidirected trees with   n   nodes under the assumption that the number of paths touching every single node of the tree is   O  ((  log  n)     1\u2212e   )  . Call scheduling is the problem of assigning paths and starting times to calls in a network with bandwidth reservation such that the maximum completion time is minimized. In the case of unit bandwidth requirements, unit edge capacities, and unit call durations, call scheduling is equivalent to path coloring. If either the bandwidth requirements or the call durations can be arbitrary, call scheduling is shown   NP  -hard for virtually every network topology.", "authors": ["Thomas Erlebach", "Klaus Jansen"], "n_citation": 105, "references": ["04eb0351-f8b7-49b6-94bc-7d99ad7dd590", "09432f14-a516-4dc4-a21c-fe1362e07be0", "23926133-51c6-4c6a-a4d8-cd53cb218d18", "26d40eab-961c-4846-bf0a-948c3a8f68ec", "40245f1a-7faa-4735-8ff5-5a10371333fc", "41a91061-2083-4152-a2e9-d407d2eaa815", "537a94d4-9b6f-4d44-8d7a-1c2377da2591", "5bde5273-9ce4-4031-8758-22dc008bf99f", "5e029b9f-871f-4d45-b869-fc5d7376fa55", "5f6c860a-2850-4199-9b32-47af5e026e09", "60f99653-6e12-4ffe-8e8d-17fc7e29cf77", "693d1505-8ae6-4411-afb5-cf888c2aa9be", "a6bae6d5-d76b-415e-9389-0c4779058ab4", "af324fa0-0a10-49b0-a548-d106b13722f6", "b554ee56-5e6a-404d-9088-c29e7cfa15db", "c066fd7a-96a6-4876-bf07-de4c063774af", "c303fc0e-8ca1-46cf-b547-01f956ece626", "d7fafe16-fd92-48cb-bbc5-329738a1364a", "de099e42-0f41-45ff-8e71-04e630734688", "ebcbd2e4-aa13-4027-b2e2-a725bc7e7b1b"], "title": "The complexity of path coloring and call scheduling", "venue": "Theoretical Computer Science", "year": 2001, "id": "6d54e7a5-8d9b-4fa4-87c9-511f77c13275"}

{"abstract": "Design patterns have been widely used for developing flexible, extensible and perceptible applications to produce effective, reliable, verifiable and easily maintained software systems. The main advantage of using patterns is to take the edge of using best practices and experiences of others in solving the challenging tasks. Patterns have been extensively tested in different applications and reusing them yields the quality software. In this paper, we present a design pattern recovery approach based on annotations, regular expressions and database queries.

It shows how various important aspects (such as ramification, qualification, specificity, simultaneity, indeterminism etc.) involved in planning (or in reasoning about action and causality for that matter) can be modelled in TL in a rather natural way. (The deductive formalism for) TL extends the linear connection method proposed earlier by the author by embedding the latter into classical logic, so that classical and resource-sensitive reasoning coexist within TL.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a reinforcement ant optimized fuzzy controller (FC) design method, called RAOFC, and applies it to wheeled-mobile-robot wall-following control under reinforcement learning environments. The inputs to the designed FC are range-finding sonar sensors, and the controller output is a robot steering angle. The antecedent part in each fuzzy rule uses interval type-2 fuzzy sets in order to increase FC robustness. No  a   priori  assignment of fuzzy rules is necessary in RAOFC. An online aligned interval type-2 fuzzy clustering (AIT2FC) method is proposed to generate rules automatically. The AIT2FC not only flexibly partitions the input space but also reduces the number of fuzzy sets in each input dimension, which improves controller interpretability. The consequent part of each fuzzy rule is designed using  Q -value aided ant colony optimization (QACO). The QACO approach selects the consequent part from a set of candidate actions according to ant pheromone trails and  Q -values, both of whose values are updated using reinforcement signals.

{"abstract": "Biped robots have better mobility than conventional wheeled robots, but they tend to tip over easily. To be able to walk stably in various environments, such as on rough terrain, up and down slopes, or in regions containing obstacles, it is necessary for the robot to adapt to the ground conditions with a foot motion, and maintain its stability with a torso motion. When the ground conditions and stability constraint are satisfied, it is desirable to select a walking pattern that requires small torque and velocity of the joint actuators. We first formulate the constraints of the foot motion parameters. By varying the values of the constraint parameters, we can produce different types of foot motion to adapt to ground conditions. We then propose a method for formulating the problem of the smooth hip motion with the largest stability margin using only two parameters, and derive the hip trajectory by iterative computation. Finally, the correlation between the actuator specifications and the walking patterns is described through simulation studies, and the effectiveness of the proposed methods is confirmed by simulation examples and experimental results.", "authors": ["Qiang Huang", "Kazuhito Yokoi", "Shuuji Kajita", "Kenji Kaneko", "Hirohiko Arai", "Noriho Koyachi", "Kazuo Tanie"], "n_citation": 1062, "references": ["01c54d4b-db04-4278-b55b-f49e9af345c8", "0b06760e-349a-4b9f-8dd8-09bfd6e5afde", "15d13a25-410e-4288-940a-43200d1ad384", "1eb6ca90-fd0a-4217-a5e7-95e2e42ec8b9", "271ded96-bd23-450b-adb7-5469b5c1fb9c", "441674f2-8aed-46fb-a16e-1ac41da8843a", "50b907db-0eaa-4139-bc15-c85ffd2cb402", "52e45041-8956-4a72-ae17-82d1769586e0", "5b258d8f-8e16-4e25-b241-4ee06e5d9a17", "603f7676-208b-4337-a6f8-cc9d1e85e140", "6c63ef32-11d5-4da3-bcc9-7cf672d27bc0", "6f63fb42-2061-488a-9db7-04a92472e74f", "92d59700-7806-4ecc-a9fb-8fb290da5475", "9456f4c4-71f3-455a-b63e-1380bdb84127", "9e334ad8-2b85-4e20-a3e3-693af4de816f", "c5025503-49db-4f3b-9572-61ed9365fd48", "fb642b8b-a75f-4e3a-904d-22cbb40ebaca"], "title": "Planning walking patterns for a biped robot", "venue": "international conference on robotics and automation", "year": 2001, "id": "264a36aa-166a-4ce6-98b1-6de61915c8df"}
{"abstract": "Previous studies suggested that local appearance-based methods are more efficient than geometric-based and holistic methods for age estimation. This is mainly due to the fact that age information are usually encoded by the local features such as wrinkles and skin texture on the forehead or at the eye corners. However, the variations of theses features caused by other factors such as identity, expression, pose and lighting may be larger than that caused by aging. Thus, one of the key challenges of age estimation lies in constructing a feature space that could successfully recovers age information while ignoring other sources of variations. In this paper, non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is extended to learn a localized non-overlapping subspace representation for age estimation. To emphasize the appearance variation in aging, one individual extended NMF subspace is learned for each age or age group. The age or age group of a given face image is then estimated based on its reconstruction error after being projected into the learned age subspaces. Furthermore, a coarse to fine scheme is employed for exact age estimation, so that the age is estimated within the pre-classified age groups. Cross-database tests are conducted using FG-NET and MORPH databases to evaluate the proposed method.

{"abstract": "We describe an algorithm for context-based segmentation of visual data. New frames in an image sequence (video) are segmented based on the prior segmentation of earlier frames in the sequence. The segmentation is performed by adapting a probabilistic model learned on previous frames, according to the content of the new frame. We utilize the maximum a posteriori version of the EM algorithm to segment the new image. The Gaussian mixture distribution that is used to model the current frame is transformed into a conjugate-prior distribution for the parametric model describing the segmentation of the new frame. This semisupervised method improves the segmentation quality and consistency and enables a propagation of segments along the segmented images. The performance of the proposed approach is illustrated on both simulated and real image data.", "authors": ["Jacob Goldberger", "Hayit Greenspan"], "n_citation": 48, "references": ["08d47f52-b403-4bf3-b816-4b8faef3451d", "11f3a6b6-a992-42db-b42f-981c945cd38b", "203a6ae1-85bf-4012-840f-beb6f1921c68", "2b9b3bcf-b563-4105-8b17-ef53403a9950", "2e9a2ffa-b741-47df-a090-c912d3f4a4ff", "39c27cd5-2cb1-48e7-b568-37ed1429e7fc", "3e89264b-53db-4894-98a0-a16110ef361a", "4d9393e3-9936-4bd4-8da2-8d3b0360ef93", "65528efd-326c-4fb9-bfef-a43093b553cd", "85dfd5b5-72bb-413d-9e78-74369aeb467e", "97cf7f10-646e-48d0-b408-c7339aa514fc", "c349411e-b528-42ba-b046-b2598b22fff7", "c591c440-b19b-4d7b-b067-cd8c366b7d6d", "c6ac418d-f9f8-4c33-9af9-88e408d7afdc", "cb5e3b2d-a97e-461f-b99e-d4593d0ef2d7", "d78003db-ad8a-48d2-be57-1c50e95cef72", "e857d69f-8241-47ad-8965-e6f7e4c00c2e"], "title": "Context-based segmentation of image sequences", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": 2006, "id": "d34f6b40-874a-4bc9-8240-9d88864046a5"}
{"abstract": "Workflow management aims at modeling and executing application processes in complex technical and organizational environments. Modern information systems are often based on object-oriented design techniques, for instance, the Unified Modeling Language (UML). These systems consist of application objects which collaborate to achieve a common goal. Although application objects collaborate in the context of business processes that can be supported by workflow technology, workflow modeling is typically done with proprietary workflow languages. Hence, two separate formalisms are present for modeling application objects and workflows. In this paper we try to remedy this situation by proposing the use of Object Coordination Nets (OCoN) for workflow modeling. OCoN nets provide a seamless integration with UML structure diagrams. The OCoN formalism also helps to deal with all relevant aspects of modeling complex workflow systems in a scalable and consistent manner.", "authors": ["Guido Wirtz", "Mathias Weske", "Holger Giese"], "n_citation": 37, "references": ["01705046-aa54-4f08-a1bd-d97e5ee8c690", "06630096-ee34-47b6-b6fc-0305eacf5d95", "0c5c8cf3-8767-47e6-bbdb-5dd85b0c0ef0", "0d261b6a-c94a-4d5e-b44e-eb6ae46581fc", "173e7b81-8d58-46ef-b218-60c9f7ebe5e4", "349b1a29-5e0f-421e-b4f7-5290441be737", "41c2b0a3-9a16-46d0-b201-adfeff668c0b", "606a5548-1b90-4cac-ba96-8b9ac6b79940", "64472c04-d171-4b64-aef2-b21e9078d287", "7d4b170d-06b1-40e0-bdfe-7e62a89cba93", "b81805c4-998b-4a02-a47b-3953a8ab932f", "b9a96a14-808a-4405-82f4-b3d49d3b9eab"], "title": "The OCoN Approach to Workflow Modeling in Object-Oriented Systems", "venue": "Information Systems Frontiers", "year": 2001, "id": "ad2bbb5e-93aa-44f3-b8db-3576b679ae38"}

The control law is developed by introducing a first-order sliding surface in terms of surge tracking errors and a second-order surface in terms of lateral motion tracking errors.

The position and orientation of the boat are measured using a camera that detects two infrared diodes attached near the front and back ends of the boat.

{"abstract": "Software developers are often faced with modification tasks that involve source which is spread across a code base. Some dependencies between source code, such as those between source code written in different languages, are difficult to determine using existing static and dynamic analyses. To augment existing analyses and to help developers identify relevant source code during a modification task, we have developed an approach that applies data mining techniques to determine change patterns - sets of files that were changed together frequently in the past - from the change history of the code base. Our hypothesis is that the change patterns can be used to recommend potentially relevant source code to a developer performing a modification task. We show that this approach can reveal valuable dependencies by applying the approach to the Eclipse and Mozilla open source projects and by evaluating the predictability and interestingness of the recommendations produced for actual modification tasks on these systems.", "authors": ["Annie T.

{"abstract": "The service-oriented paradigm promises a novel degree of interoperability between business processes, and is leading to a major shift in way distributed applications are designed and realized. While novel and more powerful services can be obtained, in such setting, by suitably orchestrating existing ones, manually developing such orchestrations is highly demanding, time-consuming and error-prone. Providing automated service composition tools is therefore essential to reduce the time to market of services, and ultimately to successfully enact the service-oriented approach. In this paper, we show that such tools can be realized based on the adoption and extension of powerful AI planning techniques, taking the ''planning via model-checking'' approach as a stepping stone. In this respect, this paper summarizes and substantially extends a research line that started early in this decade and has continued till now. Specifically, this work provides three key contributions. First, we describe a novel planning framework for the automated composition of Web services, which can handle services specified and implemented using industrial standard languages for business processes modeling and execution, like ws-bpel. Since these languages describe stateful Web services that rely on asynchronous communication primitives, a distinctive aspect of the presented framework is its ability to model and solve planning problems for asynchronous domains. Second, we formally spell out the theory underlying the framework, and provide algorithms to solve service composition in such framework, proving their correctness and completeness. The presented algorithms significantly extend state-of-the-art techniques for planning under uncertainty, by allowing the combination of asynchronous domains according to behavioral requirements. Third, we provide and discuss an implementation of the approach, and report extensive experimental results which demonstrate its ability to scale up to significant cases for which the manual development of ws-bpel composed services is far from trivial and time consuming.", "authors": ["Piergiorgio Bertoli", "Marco Pistore", "Paolo Traverso"], "n_citation": 143, "references": ["00339711-86da-48a0-b485-b54e3d1776d8", "00b04479-dab4-4127-a7ea-15d22a16de99", "0bdc624e-4af4-469c-8ea2-f6964b0a9173", "0e0a285e-0ab1-4bfa-aa2b-f3f582b5d55b", "0f104399-4ced-49b0-b65a-753fa6ba2235", "17d1c4ce-a2b5-461e-80ae-5b4b29c78d18", "19f6c640-26fc-46d5-8f9f-b482f0498cfc", "22ebecf3-41f0-4dea-8980-98f1f2c00dfe", "29c6e9df-8fc8-4b68-a369-c8855efb366c", "32ae9384-de35-4810-9c71-6b97400632bd", "346daba1-a272-44aa-b1c1-87ab78ea4641", "395682e9-e59a-43cd-84af-ee50fd5cf57f", "3acb0cec-2e48-4818-a490-bbe31fd9d98f", "3c01a9ec-258b-4307-a0c9-4465c74ba0ab", "41c18d2a-538e-46fe-8a04-e2592d8a9553", "48173942-dc20-41ff-a90f-2b91e1cc63a7", "4941745e-f61b-4929-ac2a-ed8501439081", "4c1e68a8-5ee7-452f-a022-481abf245254", "5850208a-7556-415e-8958-fcf1faaa8300", "59c56775-3f55-4902-8f70-221b238210d1", "5a7aad1c-6c25-4b8c-8864-dc87a455d590", "5ec34fa8-abcd-49d3-90e4-01045d7cc99c", "60823dda-e7e6-46b9-8cab-5c82381b9750", "67e8ccdc-e5b6-4343-82de-57f165c77494", "6c2c3c76-f407-4c36-913a-adc682a9699a", "6c99918c-bb8e-4772-a232-53d8589bcdea", "77770b5b-6258-44f7-9ee5-83ea01efd3f4", "82bbf74b-1531-414f-97fd-0296f1c13bd6", "8508a58e-67dd-4815-8b48-c48366a9d379", "8586bab2-97e5-4ff3-b96d-f61beb7b022f", "881deaf7-0617-4705-8a24-998ed37e9af1", "898492fe-f91e-466e-8dda-38850f7331c4", "8c70d15c-e9c4-41f8-9ac8-0854597d11f3", "9636f9cd-0a36-44a3-a04a-b33ec8fc6ea0", "97da6295-ce00-472f-b401-0739a12920bb", "987766dc-3833-4dbd-8327-9b881a2b2531", "9aac4e36-249d-4c2d-82b5-4f760881036f", "9d480e85-b171-40b0-a2a8-563cc6e82721", "a19d70d0-bf7f-47bb-824e-dcfffbbb62a4", "b09c13a5-e4f3-45fb-8af5-21d2f4e0c8c7", "b1763f63-4a70-449e-85c7-1276e5247617", "b23d96a7-49a5-4ace-bb41-8b90148dfaab", "b2443f6f-ee29-45ed-b053-5b89854241a4", "b2e5c69d-4408-434f-99d2-7eb0985fa0a6", "b638118a-6a3f-4d7a-b29a-bd5f1cc95f70", "b7b718be-327c-43de-9a3d-51b144ab82ec", "bf4642e7-1890-4c9d-b42a-e0630dddcc12", "c162e1a8-6566-4753-838f-a36532927976", "c22aef3d-eb44-41fb-a8b6-e24049bf0b3f", "c85f2c86-4dc8-447c-b3e6-b5cda9918e73", "cb5ab5a7-95a9-4ad1-a00c-8f5127a05c53", "d7f2c945-b293-46f9-95dd-f30e82d1dfda", "da589b08-bc38-4a39-8742-a2c9f77165c2", "e007ccfc-8bd8-40e0-9285-74941e4e5ce4", "e6e40580-c92b-4265-940f-7f6e45c8eb1f", "ec01733d-273e-498a-95d6-f90a8af2ca85", "ec7a61d5-81d5-477d-914b-12db5eb6434e", "ee809ead-133a-4e37-aa5d-09a125cc37f6", "f068e814-f9ac-42f0-b759-d121db5a50c3", "f078fe82-a687-49eb-941b-7d685efbaec3", "ffd9c070-acd3-4d56-b6a8-012f23292f8b"], "title": "Automated composition of Web services via planning in asynchronous domains", "venue": "Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2010, "id": "eb83f326-ed79-423c-ae70-55cba3e1dbc6"}
{"abstract": "We consider efficiently routing permutations in a class of switch-based interconnects. Permutation is an important communication pattern in parallel and distributed computing systems. We present a generic approach to realizing arbitrary permutations in a class of unique-path, self-routable interconnects. It is well-known that this type of interconnect has low hardware cost, but can realize only a small portion of all possible permutations between its inputs and outputs in a single pass. We consider routing arbitrary permutations with link-disjoint paths and node-disjoint paths in such interconnects in a minimum number of passes. In particular, routing with node-disjoint paths has important applications in emerging optical interconnects. We employ and further expand the Latin square technique used in all-to-all personalized exchange algorithms for this class of interconnects for general permutation routing. Our implementation of permutation routing is optimal in terms of the number of passes that messages are transmitted through the network, and it is near-optimal in network transmission time for sufficiently long messages.

{"abstract": "Fault tree analysis is a traditional deductive safety analysis technique that is applied during the system design stage. However, traditional fault trees often suffer from a lack of formal semantics to check the correctness or consistency of the descriptions. To overcome this limitation, we first propose a formal fault tree construction model in which the correctness of the fault tree is proved by the construction process per se, while at the same time subtler and more precise system safety properties are discovered. Then, based on analyzing the results of our formal fault tree model, we demonstrate how CafeOBJ, a wide spectrum specification language based on multiple logical foundations, can be used to formally model, specify, and verify a system as well as its important safety properties. Thus, we propose an integrated system analysis platform that enables engineers to find, analyze, and solve problems more efficiently and effectively.", "authors": ["Jianwen Xiang", "Kokichi Futatsugi", "Yanxiang He"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0d97c1f3-a55a-4b0f-bff1-a6764c59695b", "1c5b3b84-766f-4a6c-ae2a-de5f09a501f8", "44acd90a-ec2a-4a0f-a3cf-7d164370b0da", "4a2e8608-faf3-4c7b-8942-194f573a8e47", "77d2ea65-9174-464d-a871-60b33377035c", "8845d77c-d230-4c06-8e7b-551e94756cea", "bd03422b-5f39-4d6c-814d-36d6e344a0d1", "f99efcca-ee26-40fa-8660-19b910a7fb2a", "fdc10fc5-728a-4a39-ad0d-ca44f167650c"], "title": "Fault tree and formal methods in system safety analysis", "venue": "computer and information technology", "year": 2004, "id": "90ade178-0367-4b5a-b7c9-d0944e64d0d7"}

{"abstract": "In distributed real-time systems it is often useful for a process p to know that another process q will not use a certain piece of information that p has sent to q beyond a certain deadline. If p can learn about the occurrence of the deadline by simply measuring the passage of time on its own local clock, we call this kind of information exchange `communication by time'. It is shown that communication by time is possible in systems where there exists no a priori known upper bound on the transmission delay of messages and where clocks are not synchronised. It is sufficient if one can compute an a posteriori upper bound on the transmission delay of a message m, i.e. at the time when m is delivered. The authors show how one can compute an a posteriori upper bound on the one-way message transmission delay of a message even if the clocks of the sender and receiver process are not synchronised. The method is used to design a fail-aware datagram service. This service supports communication by time by delivering all messages whose computed one-way transmission delays are smaller than a given bound as `fast' and all other messages as `slow'.The properties of this service are specified and an efficient implementation is provided for it. To illustrate how this service supports communication by time, a leader election protocol that guarantees the existence of at most one leader at any real time is sketched and it is shown how this allows the detection of out-of-date sensor information in process control applications.", "authors": ["Christof Fetzer", "Flaviu Cristian"], "n_citation": 64, "references": ["18a8ae2c-1126-4ab5-a6f6-b93a56a6196c", "868645aa-fea0-4a4a-ac5e-24143b493bad", "8dd37c4a-1463-4b77-9523-3cdf10aaaa70", "a7d3cedd-a245-4e6a-8d91-6830ed92b35b", "b0aa0b70-a367-4be3-aad5-22ff7ef04c60", "c454b0ea-2c63-48d9-9468-5d76417afbf7"], "title": "Fail-aware datagram service", "venue": "Iee Proceedings-software", "year": 1999, "id": "8aed0a4b-9d4f-48e5-ac38-08fd92dbfd03"}

{"abstract": "The first decades of the new millennium will witness an explosive growth in the number and diversity of networked devices and portals. We foresee high degrees of mobility, heterogeneity, and interactions among computing devices connected to global networks. While previous research in distributed operating systems solved many problems related to resource management, they seldom addressed the problems of heterogeneity and dynamic adaptability. On the other hand, middleware solutions, like CORBA and Java/Jini, solve part of the heterogeneity problem by permitting seamless communication among different platforms. But, they do not address dynamic resource management and adaptability for applications requiring high-performance distributed computing.

It uses the novel heuristic method of simulating an evolutionary process to minimize the cell interconnection wire length. While achieving comparable results to popular simulated annealing algorithms, ESP usually requires less CPU time. A concurrent version designed to run on a network of loosely coupled processors, such as workstations connected via Ethernet, has also been developed. For medium to large circuits (>250 cells per processor) concurrent ESP achieves linear speedup. >", "authors": ["Ralph-Michael Kling", "Prithviraj Banerjee"], "n_citation": 167, "references": ["015df20c-e5d8-40b8-8863-ca8ae7e5a57e", "0ecf7efc-d4db-40ef-81bd-50a31d4ebbd3", "2174b19d-aa10-450e-9a70-907b6a1d6a87", "26befadc-c1fe-449c-bdf5-8d1548318150", "429b1799-cf02-44e2-8bda-f476bf53a878", "4b305ece-17ce-4425-859b-88976ad2d70d", "5d1c9e58-fee8-4bc2-8ef9-9225bfc428f4", "752591ae-935f-430d-ab8c-4780a8542a7f", "8510c67e-d6ba-417b-b789-654276799318", "9580444d-28fe-4778-9c15-627a7b5a0707", "9913d501-edc0-4a62-bab6-ee6c88ebee62", "aa340d26-b1ec-47d9-a883-a4c3890cd2f6", "bf03b746-9823-4f23-94bf-48d305c97261", "de063b5d-f48e-4e99-9517-51e7525f201e", "fd3ab23a-4392-4c6b-b1f6-1393f759105a"], "title": "ESp: Placement by simulated evolution", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems", "year": 1989, "id": "fe7f648a-f093-46d4-bbef-5625c5ef8b70"}
{"abstract": "We consider the minimum cost spanning tree problem under the restriction that all degrees must be at most a given value k. We show that we can efficiently find a spanning tree of maximum degree at most k+2 whose cost is at most the cost of the optimum spanning tree of maximum degree at most k. This is almost best possible. The approach uses a sequence of simple algebraic, polyhedral and combinatorial arguments. It illustrates many techniques and ideas in combinatorial optimization as it involves polyhedral characterizations, uncrossing, matroid intersection, and graph orientations (or packing of spanning trees). The result generalizes to the setting where every vertex has both upper and lower bounds and gives then a spanning tree which violates the bounds by at most two units and whose cost is at most the cost of the optimum tree. It also gives a better understanding of the subtour relaxation for both the symmetric and asymmetric traveling salesman problems.

In this survey, we give an overview of the basic and advanced techniques, reviewing over 20 variants and discussing their application in distributed systems, in particular for caching, peer-to-peer systems, routing and forwarding, and measurement data summarization.", "authors": ["Sasu Tarkoma", "Christian Esteve Rothenberg", "Eemil Lagerspetz"], "n_citation": 257, "references": ["00eb3335-fd62-4a7b-925e-0f29be92feb7", "02d72362-7c70-4f30-a6ba-441fb67c0b89", "05e15c00-9f57-48e7-bed9-523b6e64f8dc", "17fe5a88-477d-4961-993c-f104b16673a4", "1ae23798-95d7-4264-9df4-0467c1765a25", "1ca33e21-98b9-469b-ae02-da8ffed6b818", "1cc64868-4f72-4939-aed4-fc8fb0b45118", "1dc807ac-4408-42ef-9646-4dbdf83bad7a", "26a6d6c6-6b8d-4b08-8b31-a4efab52181a", "26ef5157-fab8-4ba1-8336-4ff20779581b", "27773467-d314-4603-9b6a-5f1aade109c9", "277f0f79-972e-48b5-bcb6-dbe182e6a04d", "2a4c40db-2770-4eff-b6eb-852ccb3b13d3", "2e0c0709-138c-461c-af4f-64037b7feee4", "36feb6fa-63c8-4c9a-bdcf-7c9fde2d52c5", "3f0285ce-cdd6-43d4-b052-8511a3851f95", "3fa4da2b-61d9-4f86-826e-0cc2fd188c44", "41c52748-a71f-4579-a082-5df1b71b65a0", "47572265-8712-4dc6-a67b-441164423abe", "48103f22-c8f3-4cb7-8de0-8637350b25c2", "4a369f17-828e-4321-a6d2-51085f8d1d28", "502bcc3c-d14b-4edb-8ca2-a2ec0925c41a", "52f9cb64-adee-41fc-a832-38ebbea7f39f", "54731ed3-1f85-414d-bf05-57a4e2a3c5ff", "5512ce3f-aeb7-4497-98b5-97a3f7f0fcd3", "565520cf-d254-4994-9360-cf0867f4f0f2", "56f83dd7-cbfc-4448-8f63-697cfa0ae023", "575e74dd-6c80-425d-b618-a4accdf8e280", "582ae3ef-34c4-48ef-8ec1-66242bb8b74d", "585fb4f7-6878-4f1b-8ffe-6aa0bdab731f", "5c2aa09f-4776-4590-91a2-b6c0fb20d152", "5c7c2767-1699-4e96-a4cd-1653c68fe9c3", "64b71788-7be6-4a23-a8f8-bfd9e4f8e5c4", "6783f4ac-5eb8-4975-a64f-852d3600d976", "67b5e105-ec80-4edc-aca2-637cf8ae439c", "68289f75-f137-4f44-8700-2363b46cfdb4", "684e0fa1-fb19-4d9a-aa3e-eac7bb985777", "6d645f43-bd4b-4bc4-9ed6-da0b86426808", "6dba5c61-b85f-4362-a9aa-8ccc7582d6e5", "6fdb51a7-14cd-4f95-ab3c-67e2addf2a09", "74de9f8a-ef46-4dfe-8178-44269c6cd77c", "74ec9465-2534-4e43-bb9c-a88589f8d20b", "78108bde-d7c1-48f4-aff1-6f0fa7d6fdd9", "7c0ca860-1887-47fc-8a91-ef5bf5646276", "7c5673e8-5bb8-4ef1-93c3-770df0b133db", "7c59e237-04e6-419a-9440-9c42ff511576", "7db6fbc0-e7a6-456c-8f70-c7a94abfde5f", "7e036d39-c434-40d1-9993-968d218dc3c7", "8093aa90-979b-4663-b394-138a0af0d5db", "814cc015-494c-4f32-b9f0-803f6d5d12e0", "82ea6eed-a94d-4439-8ca6-5d26d0aa71ce", "85e26c5b-985e-4032-881e-809c535b6c9f", "8824af63-9749-4f17-b7cd-1547611d3630", "8f81b9fb-f19d-498e-8210-b87b8f977ed0", "90ef9074-bd72-4b31-b9c0-0c20e3e7eb2e", "92e2fe8e-1f02-4a73-880d-f528b2ce4b74", "93449e22-b34d-4c2b-a37e-8802cf4b178b", "950e8595-5c28-41df-b999-42fd5caf9962", "98233a3b-7934-4b58-8fcd-873e18da0bb8", "99be0179-f75d-492e-8387-7ec39260698d", "9bca4ec4-daff-41e2-ade4-e059530cc772", "9d966424-58e9-4501-9fd1-9f3c8bc967a1", "a287bfb3-5b67-4fc8-a737-e55b5f858ebb", "aec7f44b-160b-41ff-846b-3e6b8db44e7b", "b0e41432-fadf-4a70-be74-7505b8d43cbd", "ba88245a-8ad0-4920-ad6d-71fe80ec6d65", "be61f5d7-5008-463c-9611-fc81ca7295fb", "c08b8857-29ee-4928-a2f2-76004f7b19bc", "c35a27ef-41ba-45fe-9da2-34e35ed2f17a", "c3d20994-0e7a-4f0f-bbe6-bd3589271ef5", "c3d34a4d-c580-4491-9a31-376e05e00eb1", "c4168dc3-ffb9-4906-836b-3ad95f4d10d2", "c44e07f8-5480-42e0-b9d0-fa7091cad604", "c4583612-ec29-40bc-80ff-8aa1b140d801", "c549477a-a7aa-49aa-bc5f-8f4e7d4e6197", "c5e86c59-24f8-4fc3-ba08-89cb3242a4e2", "c6adfd66-b4bf-45ca-aeba-cea4688b9364", "c8a7e095-2533-4ed6-8413-7b0a50475907", "c98a4fcb-5121-42fc-a821-7478baf418a9", "c9c9c230-47d4-4857-adc8-e501934495b7", "cbcdeab9-2af5-47c4-9eb8-e3e6e83a6efc", "cc9efe76-4069-40b4-971c-e07c0bb765b2", "cf67f4c1-ff76-4210-ba80-0356733c5be7", "dcbba265-fa46-46ed-b6e7-43745b43542b", "dcd4480b-6b27-4e53-9781-883383696ce8", "dd15cbda-5596-4b68-a323-6f716d0f18fc", "de14b1d0-2fe6-41b6-925f-dd8e9762cce4", "df679fe6-01de-4027-b068-83c58baf3996", "e0cf2bc7-dd8b-4adf-bc30-b78695774f56", "e4c1a591-ce47-4d1c-96d3-17aabf95f599", "e515e1ed-192e-4903-be00-15a79bcfde07", "e55d1a6b-8a7b-4a78-92f7-8fd0c3292426", "e568f435-4be6-45ca-bcc9-30d85a98d677", "e72f4b1d-9f53-4587-a6f5-dd2ecbe0bc06", "e81a9c22-39b3-4be6-8773-b9b5cabb0d8e", "ea0db8a3-904e-4c16-8c89-77d94d5c7c78", "ebc791b2-ff42-49b2-b416-c0c7daf95849", "ec020194-68b1-4130-bee1-0395535068ab", "f019b456-3fcf-4cf6-ba93-99284af888d6", "f208bf80-558e-4770-9af9-0e92a929bd0a", "f24c25c2-3164-4dbd-9571-054d1a255ff3", "f72fd7aa-bfe9-4373-a85d-e84f894333cd", "fac7a68f-9e3f-466a-a80d-1ed4a5d4ecfd", "fbac4dfb-8113-4939-9dbd-e8eb21b4f2a0"], "title": "Theory and Practice of Bloom Filters for Distributed Systems", "venue": "IEEE Communications Surveys and Tutorials", "year": 2012, "id": "d7649360-48de-4ca2-8203-e13715e566bc"}

While the annotation mode of CREAM allows creation of metadata for existing Web pages, the authoring mode lets authors create metadata--almost for free--while putting together the content of a page.As a feature of our framework, CREAM allows creating relational metadata, i.e., metadata that instantiate interrelated definitions of classes in a domain ontology rather than a comparatively rigid template-like schema such as Dublin Core. We discuss some of the requirements one has to meet when developing such an ontology-based framework, e.g., the integration of a metadata crawler, inference services, document management and a meta-ontology, and describe its implementation, viz.

{"abstract": "Can we use social networks to combat spam? This paper investigates the feasibility of MailRank, a new email ranking and classification scheme exploiting the social communication network created via email interactions. The underlying email network data is collected from the email contacts of all MailRank users and updated automatically based on their email activities to achieve an easy maintenance. MailRank is used to rate the sender address of arriving emails such that emails from trustworthy senders can be ranked and classified as spam or non-spam. The paper presents two variants: Basic MailRank computes a global reputation score for each email address, whereas in Personalized MailRank the score of each email address is different for each MailRank user. The evaluation shows that MailRank is highly resistant against spammer attacks, which obviously have to be considered right from the beginning in such an application scenario. MailRank also performs well even for rather sparse networks, i.e., where only a small set of peers actually take part in the ranking of email addresses.", "authors": ["Paul-Alexandru Chirita", "J\u00f6rg Diederich", "Wolfgang Nejdl"], "n_citation": 156, "references": ["1511a658-ccdc-405a-b1e0-321f4c924e2e", "1d211499-4434-469e-a20a-94359b67190a", "5445ef1f-80af-4420-a80d-469a8a25c6b9", "5bf5a964-8f0e-462f-aff5-716cfa0083d0", "91607150-f585-48ce-9475-737d58280e8a", "9f9c74c4-8573-48b7-bc6c-208f83057563", "a4bcdae0-9957-417f-8a38-61cdbc428129", "ba197833-1e73-4b97-958a-a7f593d9939c", "cb5922c5-575b-4b50-8d58-809f8256e948", "ccc5cb4e-4af9-44b4-b510-d87bea1e4500", "ed660060-755f-4f71-9268-c85518038e9d"], "title": "MailRank: using ranking for spam detection", "venue": "conference on information and knowledge management", "year": 2005, "id": "ba576ca6-2bcc-4c14-b795-ec7318cf45fb"}

{"abstract": "The development of new Web services through the composition of existing ones has gained a considerable momentum as a means to realise business-to-business collaborations. Unfortunately, given that services are often developed in an ad hoc fashion using manifold technologies and standards, connecting and coordinating them in order to build composite services is a delicate and time-consuming task. In this paper, we describe the design and implementation of a system in which services are composed using a model-driven approach, and the resulting composite services are orchestrated following a peer-to-peer paradigm. The system provides tools for specifying composite services through statecharts, data conversion rules, and multi-attribute provider selection policies. These specifications are interpreted by software components that interact in a peer-to-peer way to coordinate the execution of the composite service. We report results of an experimental evaluation showing the relative advantages of this peer-to-peer approach with respect to a centralised one.", "authors": ["Boualem Benatallah", "Marlon Dumas", "Quan Z.

{"abstract": "A comprehensive novel multi-view dynamic face model is presented in this paper to address two challenging problems in face recognition and facial analysis: modelling faces with large pose variation and modelling faces dynamically in video sequences. The model consists of a sparse 3D shape model learnt from 2D images, a shape-and-pose-free texture model, and an affine geometrical model. Model fitting is performed by optimising (1) a global fitting criterion on the overall face appearance while it changes across views and over time, (2) a local fitting criterion on a set of landmarks, and (3) a temporal fitting criterion between successive frames in a video sequence. By temporally estimating the model parameters over a sequence input, the identity and geometrical information of a face is extracted separately. The former is crucial to face recognition and facial analysis. The latter is used to aid tracking and aligning faces. We demonstrate the results of successfully applying this model on faces with large variation of pose and expression over time.", "authors": ["Yongmin Li", "Shaogang Gong", "Heather M.

{"abstract": "Continuous monitoring of temperature distribution in lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries is critical in preventing rapid degradation, mismatch in cell capacity, and potentially thermal runaway. A model based on virtual thermal sensor (VTS) for automotive grade Li-ion batteries is presented in this paper.

First, the thermal model of the battery is developed and the characteristic parameters of the battery are tuned using the prediction error minimization method. Then, the tuned model is combined with a Kalman filter to estimate the temperature distribution of the battery under unknown initial values and model uncertainty.

The new algorithm can be performed in the fields (or rings) generated by the input values, which enables us to decrease the precision of the computations [by using modular (residue) arithmetic] and to simplify our computations further in the case whereu=O(logn). Our algorithm allows NC and simultaneously processor efficient parallel implementation.

{"abstract": "This paper develops a framework for the estimation of a time-varying random signal using a distributed sensor network. Given a continuous time model sensors collect noisy observations and produce local estimates according to the discrete time equivalent system defined by the sampling period of observations. Estimation is performed using a maximum a posteriori probability estimator (MAP) within a given window of interest. To mediate the incorporation of information from other sensors we introduce Lagrange multipliers to penalize the disagreement between neighboring estimates. We show that the resulting distributed (D)-MAP algorithm is able to track dynamical signals with a small error. This error is characterized in terms of problem constants and vanishes with the sampling time as long as the log-likelihood function which is assumed to be log-concave satisfies a smoothness condition. We implement the D-MAP algorithm for a linear and a nonlinear system model to show that the performance corroborates with theoretical findings.", "authors": ["Felicia Y.

{"abstract": "This paper investigates the effect of sub-Nyquist sampling upon the capacity of an analog channel. The channel is assumed to be a linear time-invariant Gaussian channel, where perfect channel knowledge is available at both the transmitter and the receiver. We consider a general class of right-invertible time-preserving sampling methods which includes irregular nonuniform sampling, and characterize in closed form the channel capacity achievable by this class of sampling methods, under a sampling rate and power constraint. Our results indicate that the optimal sampling structures extract out the set of frequencies that exhibits the highest signal-to-noise ratio among all spectral sets of measure equal to the sampling rate. This can be attained through filterbank sampling with uniform sampling grid employed at each branch with possibly different rates, or through a single branch of modulation and filtering followed by uniform sampling. These results reveal that for a large class of channels, employing irregular nonuniform sampling sets, while are typi- cally complicated to realize in practice, does not provide capacity gain over uniform sampling sets with appropriate preprocessing. Our findings demonstrate that aliasing or scrambling of spectral components does not provide capacity gain in this scenario, which is in contrast to the benefits obtained from random mixing in spectrum-blind compressive sampling schemes.", "authors": ["Yuxin Chen", "Andrea J.

Until now, these MIPS environments have been handcrafted.

{"abstract": "A key element in the solution of reinforcement learning problems is the value function. The purpose of this function is to measure the long-term utility or value of any given state and it is important because an agent can use it to decide what to do next. A common problem in reinforcement learning when applied to systems having continuous states and action spaces is that the value function must operate with a domain consisting of real-valued variables, which means that it should be able to represent the value of infinitely many state and action pairs. For this reason, function approximators are used to represent the value function when a close-form solution of the optimal policy is not available. In this paper, we extend a previously proposed reinforcement learning algorithm so that it can be used with function approximators that generalize the value of individual experiences across both, state and action spaces. In particular, we discuss the benefits of using sparse coarse-coded function approximators to represent value functions and describe in detail three implementations: CMAC, instance-based, and case-based. Additionally, we discuss how function approximators having different degrees of resolution in different regions of the state and action spaces may influence the performance and learning efficiency of the agent. We propose a simple and modular technique that can be used to implement function approximators with non-uniform degrees of resolution so that it can represent the value function with higher accuracy in important regions of the state and action spaces.

{"abstract": "This paper develops a distinctive class of color error diffusion algorithm, called hierarchical error diffusion (HED). It aims to achieve perceptually pleasing color halftone through neither conventional joint quantization nor interchannel error diffusion. Instead, it explicitly controls three critical factors sequentially to yield high-quality color halftone: dot-overlapping control, dot-positioning control, and dot-coloring control. A specific implementation of HED is presented with the objective of minimum brightness variation rendering (MBVR). First, an optimal color transform is derived for dot-overlapping control to achieve minimum brightness variation color density (MBVCD). Then, the embedded monochrome error diffusion is employed in dot-positioning control. By sequentially thresholding the elements in partial density sum vector, better dot-positioning is encouraged for more visible color dots. The ldquoblue noiserdquo characteristics of dot-positioning from the monochrome error diffusion are inherited by the color halftone.

{"abstract": "This paper considers the problem of constrained nonlinear trajectory tracking control for unmanned air vehicles (UAVs). We assume that the UAV is equipped with longitudinal and lateral autopilots which reduces the 12-state model to a six-state model with altitude, heading, and velocity command inputs. One of the novel features of our approach is that we explicitly account for heading rate and velocity input constraints. For a UAV, the velocity is constrained to lie between two positive constants, and therefore presents particular challenges for the control design. We propose a control Lyapunov function (CLF) approach. We first introduce a CLF for the input constrained case, and then construct the set of all constrained inputs that are feasible with respect to this CLF. The control input is then selected from this \"feasible\" set. The proposed approach is applied to a simulation scenario, where the UAV is assigned to transition through several targets in the presence of multiple dynamic threats.", "authors": ["Wei Ren", "Randal W.

{"abstract": "Placement of wavelength converters in an arbitrary mesh network is known to be a NP-complete problem. So far, this problem has been solved by heuristic strategies or by the application of optimization tools such as genetic algorithms. In this paper, we introduce a novel evolutionary algorithm: particle swarm optimization (PSO) to find the optimal solution to the converters placement problem. The major advantage of this algorithm is that does not need to build up a search tree or to create auxiliary graphs in find the optimal solutions. In addition, the computed results show that only a few particles are needed to search the optimal solutions of the placement of wavelength converters problem in an arbitrary network. Experiments have been conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed evolutionary algorithm. It was found that the efficiency of PSO can even exceed 90% under certain circumstances. In order to further improve the efficiency in obtaining the optimal solutions, four strategic initialization schemes are investigated and compared with the random initializations of PSO particles.", "authors": ["Choon Fang Teo", "Yun Cie Foo", "Su Fong Chien", "Andy Lock Yen Low", "A.

{"abstract": "Context: Many metrics are used in software engineering research as surrogates for maintainability of software systems. Aim: Our aim was to investigate whether such metrics are consistent among themselves and the extent to which they predict maintenance effort at the entire system level. Method: The Maintainability Index, a set of structural measures, two code smells (Feature Envy and God Class) and size were applied to a set of four functionally equivalent systems. The metrics were compared with each other and with the outcome of a study in which six developers were hired to perform three maintenance tasks on the same systems. Results: The metrics were not mutually consistent. Only system size and low cohesion were strongly associated with increased maintenance effort. Conclusion: Apart from size, surrogate maintainability measures may not reflect future maintenance effort. Surrogates need to be evaluated in the contexts for which they will be used. While traditional metrics are used to identify problematic areas in the code, the improvements of the worst areas may, inadvertently, lead to more problems for the entire system.

The representation formalism should be expressive, efficient, useful, and applicable. First-order logic needs to be restricted in order to be efficient for inductive and deductive reasoning.

In this article, a learning algorithm, KLUSTER, is described that represents concept definitions in this formalism. KLUSTER enhances the representation language if this is necessary for the discrimination of concepts. Hence, KLUSTER is a constructive induction program.

The theory of type classes is well understood, but the practical issues involved in the implementation of such systems have not received a great deal of attention. In addition to the basic type checking algorithm, an implmenentation of type classes also requires some form of program transformation. In all current Haskell compilers this takes the form of dictionary conversion, using functions as hidden parameters to overloaded values.

As a result of learning, a representation of the continuous two-dimensional (2-D) manifold in the high-dimensional input space is found. The representation consists of a population of localized overlapping place fields covering the 2-D space densely and uniformly. This space coding is comparable to the representation provided by hippocampal place cells in rats. Place fields are learned by extracting spatio-temporal properties of the environment from sensory inputs. The visual scene is modeled using the responses of modified Gabor filters placed at the nodes of a sparse Log-polar graph. Visual sensory aliasing is eliminated by taking into account self-motion signals via path integration. This solves the hidden state problem and provides a suitable representation for applying reinforcement learning in continuous space for action selection. A temporal-difference prediction scheme is used to learn sensorimotor mappings to perform goal-oriented navigation. Population vector coding is employed to interpret ensemble neural activity.

{"abstract": "Many clustering algorithms, including cluster ensembles, rely on a random component. Stability of the results across different runs is considered to be an asset of the algorithm. The cluster ensembles considered here are based on k-means clusterers. Each clusterer is assigned a random target number of clusters, k and is started from a random initialization. Here, we use 10 artificial and 10 real data sets to study ensemble stability with respect to random k, and random initialization. The data sets were chosen to have a small number of clusters (two to seven) and a moderate number of data points (up to a few hundred). Pairwise stability is defined as the adjusted Rand index between pairs of clusterers in the ensemble, averaged across all pairs. Nonpairwise stability is defined as the entropy of the consensus matrix of the ensemble. An experimental comparison with the stability of the standard k-means algorithm was carried out for k from 2 to 20. The results revealed that ensembles are generally more stable, markedly so for larger k. To establish whether stability can serve as a cluster validity index, we first looked at the relationship between stability and accuracy with respect to the number of clusters, k. We found that such a relationship strongly depends on the data set, varying from almost perfect positive correlation (0.97, for the glass data) to almost perfect negative correlation (-0.93, for the crabs data). We propose a new combined stability index to be the sum of the pairwise individual and ensemble stabilities. This index was found to correlate better with the ensemble accuracy.

{"abstract": "A novel modeling and control methodology is proposed in this paper for real-time compensation of nonlinearities along with precision trajectory control of piezoelectric actuators in various range of frequency operation. By integrating a modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii hysteresis operator with a second-order linear dynamics, a nonlinear dynamic model and an inverse feedforward controller are developed and experimentally validated for a piezoelectrically driven nanopositioning stage. This modeling and control framework, however, lacks the accuracy due to the hysteresis model limitation, parametric uncertainties, and ever present unmodeled dynamics. Utilizing the sliding mode control strategy coupled with a perturbation estimation technique, a robust controller is then proposed for trajectory tracking of the actuator displacement. The controller gains are adjusted based on an intelligent comparison of the dynamic model and the control law. Eventually, the performance of the proposed controller is verified for the nanopositioning stage which is equipped with a high resolution capacitive position sensor. Experimental results demonstrate that the controller is capable of precisely tracking triangular and multiple frequency sinusoidal trajectories, which are common practices in many scanning probe microscopy systems.", "authors": ["Saeid Bashash", "Nader Jalili"], "n_citation": 151, "references": ["9bc97fdb-2ad0-401b-9751-bde2bdcffad1", "cac4c3b0-5eec-4765-bccf-ae9f6d3dc7dd", "e8e9bc56-8564-4065-8710-89981b2f3491", "ead30679-a92f-45f9-a3bd-0c76a4a0b479"], "title": "Robust Multiple Frequency Trajectory Tracking Control of Piezoelectrically Driven Micro/Nanopositioning Systems", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Control Systems and Technology", "year": 2007, "id": "236ba6d9-2daa-4eb3-a800-0765589b5165"}

{"abstract": "A local graph partitioning algorithm finds a cut near a specified starting vertex, with a running time that depends largely on the size of the small side of the cut, rather than the size of the input graph.

We derive a mixing result for PageRank vectors similar to that for random walks, and show that the ordering of the vertices produced by a PageRank vector reveals a cut with small conductance. In particular, we show that for any set C with conductance \\Phi and volume k, a PageRank vector with a certain starting distribution can be used to produce a set with conductance O\\left( {\\sqrt {\\Phi \\log k} } \\right). We present an improved algorithm for computing approximate PageRank vectors, which allows us to find such a set in time proportional to its size.

{"abstract": "Organizations deploy intranets to provide access to documents for those who use them. But the web of computing comprises more than just documents: people, tools, and processes are critical to organizational function. In particular, people may need guidance on how to perform tasks, as well as access to information necessary to carry out those tasks.In this paper, we present a language for describing process-oriented hypertexts. A process-oriented hypertext links information, tools, and activities into a seamless organizational web. Using such a hypertext, the process performer can enact a process by browsing, and receive guidance on how to perform the process activities, where to find relevant information, and what tools to use.We have developed a process scripting language called PML that provides a way for process engineers to specify process models in terms of activities, and the sequence in which they should be performed. The specification can be elaborated with descriptions of resources and tools required and provided by activities, and the skills necessary to carry out an activity. The resulting models are then translated into one or more process-oriented hypertexts that represent instances of the process currently being performed.PML includes features that allow the modeler to specify how the process activities should be dynamically linked to information and resource nodes at the time the process is performed. This enables processes to be described as abstract models that can be instantiated as process-oriented hypertexts in different organizational settings.We used PML to model processes in a case study of the grants management process at the US Office of Naval Research.

(1) any derivative of a regular expression  r  can be represented by a finite set of partial derivatives of  r ;   2.   (2) the set of all partial derivatives of  r  is finite and its cardinality is less than or equal to one plus the number of occurrences of letters from A appearing in  r ;   3.

{"abstract": "This paper presents an optimization of the power saving mechanism in the Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) in an Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) of the IEEE 802.11 standard. In the power saving mode specified for DCF, time is divided into so-called beacon intervals. At the start of each beacon interval, each node in the power saving mode periodically wakes up for a duration called the ATIM Window. Nodes are required to be synchronized to ensure that all nodes wake up at the same time. During the ATIM window, the nodes exchange control packets to determine whether they need to stay awake for the rest of the beacon interval. The size of the ATIM window has a significant impact on energy saving and throughput achieved by the nodes. This paper proposes an adaptive mechanism to dynamically choose a suitable ATIM window size. We also allow the nodes to stay awake for only a fraction of the beacon interval following the ATIM window. On the other hand, the IEEE 802.11 DCF mode requires nodes to stay awake either for the entire beacon interval following the ATIM window or not at all. Simulation results showthat the proposed approach outperforms the IEEE 802.11 power saving mechanism in terms of throughput and the amount of energy consumed.", "authors": ["Eun Sun Jung", "Nitin H.

{"abstract": "Choreography and orchestration languages deal with business processes design and specification. Referring to Web Services technology, the most credited proposals are WS-CDL about choreography and WS-BPEL about orchestration. A closer look to such a kind of languages highlights two distinct approaches for system representation and management.

{"abstract": "Searching for motifs in graphs has become a crucial problem in the analysis of biological networks. In the context of metabolic network analysis, Lacroix et al. [V. Lacroix, C.G. Fernandes, M.-F. Sagot, IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinfor-matics 3 (4) (2006) 360-368] introduced the NP-hard general problem of finding occurrences of motifs in vertex-colored graphs, where a motifM is a multiset of colors and an occurrence of M in a vertex-colored graph G, called the target graph, is a subset of vertices that induces a connected graph and the multiset of colors induced by this subset is exactly the motif. Pursuing the line of research pioneered by Lacroix et al. and aiming at dealing with approximate solutions, we consider in this paper the above-mentioned problem in two of its natural optimization forms, referred hereafter as the Min-CC and the Maximum Motif problems. The Min-CC problem seeks for an occurrence of a motif M in a vertex-colored graph G that induces a minimum number of connected components whereas the Maximum Motif problem is concerned with finding a maximum cardinality submotif M^'@?M that occurs as a connected motif in G. We prove the Min-CC problem to be APX-hard even in the extremal case where the motif is a set and the target graph is a path. We complement this result by giving a polynomial-time algorithm in case the motif is built upon a fixed number of colors and the target graph is a path. Also, extending [M. Fellows, G. Fertin, D. Hermelin, S. Vialette, in: Proc. 34th International Colloquium on Automata, Languages and Programming (ICALP), Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 4596, Springer, 2007, pp. 340-351], we prove the Min-CC problem to be fixed-parameter tractable when parameterized by the size of the motif, and we give a faster algorithm in case the target graph is a tree. Furthermore, we prove the Min-CC problem for trees not to be approximable within ratio clogn for some constant c>0, where n is the order of the target graph, and to be W[2]-hard when parameterized by the number of connected components in the occurrence of the motif. Finally, we give an exact exponential-time algorithm for the Min-CC problem in case the target graph is a tree. We prove that the Maximum Motif problem is APX-hard even in the case where the target graph is a tree of maximum degree 3, the motif is actually a set and each color occurs at most twice in the tree. Next, we strengthen this result by proving that the problem is not approximable within factor 2^l^o^g^^^@d^n, for any constant @d<1, unless NP@?DTIME(2^p^o^l^y^l^o^g^n). We complement these results by presenting two fixed-parameter algorithms for the problem, where the parameter is the size of the solution.

This paper presents (1) three design schemes of dynamic rerouting networks to tolerate faults and prevent collisions; (2) design schemes that enable a dynamic rerouting network to use destination tag routing to save hardware cost in switches for computing rerouting tags; (3) a method to prevent a packet from re-encountering the faulty element again after rerouting to reduce the number of rerouting hops and improve the arrival ratio; and (4) simulation results of related dynamic rerouting networks to realize the factors which influence the arrival ratio including the fault tolerant capability and the number of rerouting hops.

{"abstract": "John McLeanCenter for High Assurance Computer SystemsNaval Research LaboratoryWashington, D.C. 20375Many claim that the security model developed by Bell and LaPadula and used as a basis for numerous pro-totype military computer systems is superior to others partly because its authors prove a \"Basic SecurityTheorem\" that applies to it. This paper shows that the theorem does not support such claims since it can beproven for security models that are obviously not secure. Further, the theorem provides little help to thosewho design and implement secure systems.1. IntroductionThe security model developed by Bell and LaPadula [1] has been widely used as a basis for design-ing systems with speci\ufb01ed security properties [2]. It has been argued that one reason developers shouldhave con\ufb01dence in the security provided by systems based on this model is a theorem, called the \"BasicSecurity Theorem\" (BST) [1, p. 20], proven about a formalization of the model by its authors [1,p.90,corollary A1]. Several authors have proven similarly named theorems about related security models[3,4,5]. This note reviews the Bell-LaPadula model brie\ufb02y and shows that the BST can be proven for sys-tems that directly contradict the notion of security embodied in the Bell-LaPadula model. We concludethat the value of the BST is much overrated since there is a great deal more to security than it captures.Further, what is captured by the BST is so trivial that it is hard to imagine a realistic security model forwhich it doesn\u2019t hold.2. Bell-LaPadula ModelThe Bell-LaPadula model is based on a state machine in which subjects apply operations (rules) thatmay require access to objects. The state of the system includes a set of triples that de\ufb01ne the current accessmode each subject has to each object in the system. Permissible access is determined partly by a securitylevel (classi\ufb01cation orclearance) associated with each object and subject. These security levels are par-tially ordered. Each subject also has a current security level that is bounded above by its clearance. Thereis also an access matrix that further constrains the access mode an arbitrary subject is allowed to have to anarbitrary object.The following formal description of the Bell-LaPadula model corresponds to the original notation [1]as closely as possible, but nonessential details are omitted. Consider the sets S, O, and A whose elementsare known as subjects, objects, and access modes, respectively. Intuitively, S consists of all system usersand programs; O consists of all system \ufb01les; andA is {read, execute ,write ,append}, the set of all modesin which an element of S can have access to an element of O. Bell and LaPadula de\ufb01ne asystem state vas an element of V=(B\u00d7M\u00d7F\u00d7H), whereB is the set of current accesses, a subset of S\u00d7O\u00d7A that gives the access modes each subjectcurrently has to each object,M is the access permission matrix, where M", "authors": ["John McLean"], "n_citation": 155, "references": ["18ff6bac-ef14-4284-bf1b-3ff70e560b98", "4fa82f0a-be9f-4452-ad79-e63092e09bf7"], "title": "A comment on the `basic security theorem' of Bell and LaPadula", "venue": "Information Processing Letters", "year": 1985, "id": "85e8ebf8-9524-4ba6-99b5-a94bbabe5b33"}

{"abstract": "Hypo, a computer program that performs case-based reasoning in the legal domain, helps attorneys analyze and make arguments about new fact situations in terms of the most relevant precedent cases. To perform this task, Hypo must make factual comparisons of cases relative to the problem situation and determine the legal significance of comparisons in terms of arguments about the problem situation. The authors describe techniques that Hypo uses to compare cases, choose the best cases for evaluating, and construct arguments about a new fact situation. They demonstrate how Hypo critically compares a problem situation to the most relevantly similar precedent cases to outline an argument regarding how to decide the current fact situation (CFS) based on its significant similarities to and differences from most on point cases (MOPCS). Hypo's main tool for this task is the claim lattice mechanism. The authors present a detailed example of a claim lattice actually generated by Hypo to analyze a real legal case. >", "authors": ["Kevin D. Ashley", "Edwina L.

{"abstract": "Despite considerable advancements in the area of access control and authorization languages, current approaches to enforcing access control are all based on monolithic and complete specifications. This assumption is too restrictive when access control restrictions to be enforced come from the combination of different policy specifications, each possibly under the control of independent authorities, and where the specifics of some component policies may not even be known apriori. Turning individual specifications into a coherent policy to be fed into the access control system requires a nontrivial combination and translation process. This article addresses the problem of combining authorization specifications that may be independently stated, possibly in different languages and according to different policies. We propose an algebra of security policies together with its formal semantics and illustrate how to formulate complex policies in the algebra and reason about them. A translation of policy expressions into equivalent logic programs is illustrated, which provides the basis for the implementation of the algebra. The algebra's expressiveness is analyzed through a comparison with first-order logic.", "authors": ["Piero A.

By using a parametric solution to a class of generalized Sylvester matrix equations, a parametrization is proposed for the residual generator on the basis of a Luenberger function observer. By further properly constraining the design parameters provided in the Luenberger observer design, the effect of the unknown disturbance is decoupled from the residual signal.

{"abstract": "This paper describes our work on dialogue systems that can mimic human conversation, with the goal of providing intuitive access to a wide range of applications by expanding the user's options in the interaction. We concentrate on practical dialogue: dialogues in which the participants need to accomplish some objective or perform some task. Two hypotheses regarding practical dialogue motivate our research. First, that the conversational competence required for practical dialogues, while still complex, is significantly simpler to achieve than general human conversational competence. And second, that within the genre of practical dialogue, the bulk of the complexity in the language interpretation and dialogue management is independent of the task being performed. If these hypotheses are true, then it should be possible to build a generic dialogue shell for practical dialogue, by which we mean the full range of components required in a dialogue system, including speech recognition, language processing, dialogue management and response planning, built in such a way as to be readily adapted to new applications by specifying the domain and task models.

{"abstract": "This paper describes new algorithms for approximately solving the concurrent multicommodity flow problem with uniform capacities. These algorithms are much faster than algorithms discovered previously. Besides being an important problem in its own right, the uniform-capacity concurrent flow problem has many interesting applications. Leighton and Rao used uniform-capacity concurrent flow to find an approximately \"sparsest cut\" in a graph and thereby approximately solve a wide variety of graph problems, including minimum feedback arc set, minimum cut linear arrangement, and minimum area layout. However, their method appeared to be impractical as it required solving a large linear program. This paper shows that their method might be practical by giving an $O(m^2 \\log m)$ expected-time randomized algorithm for their concurrent flow problem on an $m$-edge graph. Raghavan and Thompson used uniform-capacity concurrent flow to solve approximately a channel width minimization problem in very large scale integration. An $O(k^{3/2} (m + n \\log n))$ expected-time randomized algorithm and an $O(k\\min{n,k} (m+n\\log n)\\log k)$ deterministic algorithm is given for this problem when the channel width is $\\Omega(\\log n)$, where $k$ denotes the number of wires to be routed in an $n$-node, $m$-edge network.", "authors": ["Philip N.

We study stability in the presence of measurement noise and illustrate the tradeoff when selecting the observer gain between state reconstruction speed and robustness to model uncertainty on the one hand versus amplification of noise on the other. Based on this tradeoff we propose a high-gain observer that switches between two gain values. This scheme is able to quickly recover the system states during large estimation error and reduce the effect of measurement noise in a neighborhood of the origin of the estimation error.

{"abstract": "The integration of object-oriented concepts into deductive databases has been investigated for a certain time now. Various approaches to incorporate updates into deduction have been proposed. The current paper presents an approach which is based on object versioning; different versions of one object may be created and referenced during an update-process. By means of such versions it becomes possible to exert explicit control on the update process during bottom-up evaluation in a rather intuitive way. The units for updates are the result sets of base methods, i.e. methods, whose results are stored in the object-base and are not defined by rules. However, the update itself may be defined by rules. Update-programs have fixpoint semantics; the fixpoint can be computed by a bottom-up evaluation according to a certain stratification.", "authors": ["Michael Kramer", "Georg Lausen", "Gunter Saake"], "n_citation": 34, "references": ["1b548618-58cb-4d62-a8e1-37d595876380", "1e3a6174-5b6b-4980-a311-2f796df2c6f3", "20c9ccf0-b55c-4584-aace-619ffe1b7e1b", "3ac19b2b-e8a4-4e2b-adea-f228c3f24959", "4dca46ee-7e17-4676-88ad-c0981b70463c", "63dcecd9-302c-4153-a0ee-53593392970f", "7b7ff85a-3f13-46d6-a799-28a86a5b0de7", "8d6430dc-a8ca-40ed-bead-a523aa31850c", "997e2b1f-327d-4212-a71f-a5936b723772", "a150ee36-6e12-4ec2-a974-5df716b2ed32", "a1ca4cd3-19e1-46a2-80bd-574b89c015ba", "a47b1672-c110-4805-baa1-a63c30cd5108", "a82105a8-d66e-4fcf-9e39-25047e11a683", "b520d589-e0d1-4208-8d60-d6ad736e0e72", "b70206c7-d406-4d8f-b6b2-9c5cb1866b40", "d1e73660-9287-4e9a-b5d2-5bbce248933c", "d979841a-b2ca-42bf-a39d-99c30c62fd20", "e9cb4f12-f852-4a0d-bc43-822771528cbd", "eb80e1f9-db49-43fb-99f9-db722b571533"], "title": "Updates in a Rule-Based Language for Objects", "venue": "very large data bases", "year": 1992, "id": "44d956a9-9089-43c8-9d5e-198e3a49217b"}

{"abstract": "Software developers often face the task of determining how the behaviors of one version of a program unit differ from (or are the same as) the behaviors of a (slightly) dif- ferent version of the same program unit. In such situations, developers would like to generate tests that exhibit the be- havioral differences between the two versions, if any dif- ferences exist. We call this type of testing differential unit testing. Some examples of differential unit testing include regression testing, N-version testing, and mutation testing. We propose a framework, called Diffut, that enables dif- ferential unit testing of object-oriented programs. Diffut en- ables \"simultaneous\" execution of the pairs of correspond- ing methods from the two versions: methods can receive the same inputs (consisting of the object graph reachable from the receiver and method arguments), and Diffut compares their outputs (consisting of the object graph reachable from the receiver and method return values). Given two versions of a Java class, Diffut automatically synthesizes annota- tions (in the form of preconditions and postconditions) in the Java Modeling Language (JML) and inserts them into the unit under test to allow the simultaneous execution of the corresponding methods.", "authors": ["Tao Xie", "Kunal Taneja", "Shreyas Kale", "Darko Marinov"], "n_citation": 30, "references": ["05dd259f-bc12-4b6f-8290-49f9edc589a2", "076e53a8-7022-4c3f-8033-39a160853e95", "10fcc683-8c95-4095-a8a8-5891edd7dad6", "148b67e3-da2b-472f-b259-216733ea669d", "573c1623-923d-44b8-b86f-4414060e3f7d", "70838b11-9aa9-41c0-bb4f-a9b2750138d3", "91ab327c-9299-49d0-94cc-57247851c2c3", "a7122806-c66c-49e6-8876-70093d70f605", "adae4167-6e4a-47d0-bda0-f7090a978ece", "bb4559e0-a286-41ed-a6cb-cef0f6daca3e", "de0526f8-c7a6-4134-9b60-5d76d46e080e", "fd3c0d46-0bfd-4635-bf91-21eb295a9fb2", "fe0f5106-bb0b-4f6b-a584-db40281a659e"], "title": "Towards a Framework for Differential Unit Testing of Object-Oriented Programs", "venue": "automation of software test", "year": 2007, "id": "d9b54ac7-b54e-4d6a-806c-8bf70ea03bee"}

{"abstract": "Abstraction of semantics of blocks of a binary is termed as 'juice.' Whereas the denotational semantics summarizes the computation performed by a block, its juice presents a template of the relationships established by the block. BinJuice is a tool for extracting the 'juice' of a binary. It symbolically interprets individual blocks of a binary to extract their semantics: the effect of the block on the program state. The semantics is generalized to juice by replacing register names and literal constants by typed, logical variables. The juice also maintains algebraic constraints between the numeric variables. Thus, this juice forms a semantic template that is expected to be identical regardless of code variations due to register renaming, memory address allocation, and constant replacement. The terms in juice can be canonically ordered using a linear order presented. Thus semantically equivalent (rather, similar) code fragments can be identified by simple structural comparison of their juice, or by comparing their hashes. While BinJuice cannot find all equivalent constructs, for that would solve the Halting Problem, it does significantly improve the state-of-the-art in both the computational complexity as well as the set of equivalences it can establish.

{"abstract": "The trend toward physically dispersed work groups has necessitated a fresh inquiry into the role and nature of team leadership in virtual settings. To accomplish this, we assembled thirteen culturally diverse global teams from locations in Europe, Mexico, and the United States, assigning each team a project leader and task to complete. The findings suggest that effective team leaders demonstrate the capability to deal with paradox and contradiction by performing multiple leadership roles simultaneously (behavioral complexity). Specifically, we discovered that highly effective virtual team leaders act in a mentoring role and exhibit a high degree of understanding (empathy) toward other team members. At the same time, effective leaders are also able to assert their authority without being perceived as overbearing or inflexible. Finally, effective leaders are found to be extremely effective at providing regular, detailed, and prompt communication with their peers and in articulating role relationships (responsibilities) among the virtual team members.

{"abstract": "Although compile-time optimizations generally improve program performance, degradations caused by individual techniques are to be expected. One promising research direction to overcome this problem is the development of dynamic, feedback-directed optimization orchestration algorithms, which automatically search for the combination of optimization techniques that achieves the best program performance. The challenge is to develop an orchestration algorithm that finds, in an exponential search space, a solution that is close to the best, in acceptable time. In this paper, we build such a fast and effective algorithm, called combined elimination (CE). The key advance of CE over existing techniques is that it takes the least tuning time (57% of the closest alternative), while achieving the same program performance. We conduct the experiments on both a Pentium IV machine and a SPARC II machine, by measuring performance of SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks under a large set of 38 GCC compiler options. Furthermore, through orchestrating a small set of optimizations causing the most degradation, we show that the performance achieved by CE is close to the upper bound obtained by an exhaustive search algorithm.

{"abstract": "We investigate the notion of Long Range Contact graphs. Roughly speaking, such a graph is defined by (1) an underlying network topology G, and (2) one (or possibly more) extra link connecting every node u to a \"long distance\" neighbor, called the long range contact of u. This extra link represents the a priori knowledge that a node has about far nodes and is set up randomly according to some probability distributions p. To illustrate the claim that Long Range Contact graphs are a good model for the small world phenomenon, we study greedy routing in these graphs. Greedy routing is the distributed routing protocol in which a node u makes use of its long range contact to progress toward a target, if this contact is closer to the target, than the other neighbors. We give upper and lower bounds on greedy routing on the n-node ring Cn augmented with links chosen using the r-harmonic distributions. In particular, we show a tight ?(log2 n)-bound for the expected number of steps required for routing in Cn augmented using the 1-harmonic distribution. Hence, our study shows that the model of Kleinberg [11] can be simplified by using the ring rather than the mesh while preserving the main features of the model. Our study also demonstrates the significant difference (in term of both diameter and routing) between the ring augmented with long range contacts chosen with the harmonic distribution and the ring augmented with a random matching as introduced by Bollobas and Chung [3]. Finally, using epimorphisms of a graph onto another, for any network G, we show how to define a probability distribution p and study the performance of greedy routing in G augmented with p. For appropriate embeddings (if they exist), this performance turns out to be O(log2 n).", "authors": ["Lali Barri\u00e8re", "Pierre Fraigniaud", "Evangelos Kranakis", "Danny Krizanc"], "n_citation": 141, "references": ["05332f60-3d2e-45bb-9ecd-a7c7aa7774dc", "169cd5aa-8bb3-466d-90a8-8fd1889b0746", "1a24e9c7-d0ce-4be4-8e3a-c849b4630851", "39f345dd-6fb3-42b0-b9bd-528ef1c528fb", "3f610d75-809b-4a12-858f-95e346c17e8c", "50d9c6d7-da7f-4b45-862d-d8fdab48267b", "62c0d7d2-9cc5-4b96-9a84-42d5ba0bed10", "6e6cac85-1ca8-4d49-8e16-aa3d353fc20a", "7192626f-12df-45f7-889d-c78e4da08773", "b9a9151a-158f-4d23-acb4-b1a45b6c527e"], "title": "Efficient Routing in Networks with Long Range Contacts", "venue": "international symposium on distributed computing", "year": 2001, "id": "0ce6f34d-d4c3-4c71-ad8e-f1c46bd4726d"}

{"abstract": "A multi-UAV system relies on communications to operate. Failure to communicate remotely sensed mission data to the base may render the system ineffective, and the inability to exchange command and control messages can lead to system failures. This paper describes a unique method to control communications through distributed task allocation to engage under-utilized UAVs to serve as communication relays and to ensure that the network supports mission tasks. The distributed algorithm uses task assignment information, including task location and proposed execution time, to predict the network topology and plan support using relays. By explicitly coupling task assignment and relay creation processes the team is able to optimize the use of agents to address the needs of dynamic complex missions. The framework is designed to consider realistic network communication dynamics including path loss, stochastic fading, and information routing. The planning strategy is shown to ensure that agents support both datarate and interconnectivity bit-error-rate requirements during task execution.

{"abstract": "This paper is about analytical models for calculating the average bandwidth shares obtained by TCP controlled finite file transfers that arrive randomly and share a single (bottleneck) link. Owing to the complex nature of the TCP congestion control algorithm, a single model does not work well for all combinations of network parameters (i.e., mean file size, link capacity, and propagation delay). We propose two models, develop their analyses, and identify the regions of their applicability. One model is obtained from a detailed analysis of TCP's AIMD adaptive window mechanism; the analysis accounts for session arrivals and departures, and finite link buffers. It is essentially a processor sharing (PS) model with time varying service rate; hence we call it TCP-PS. The other model is a simple modification of the PS model that accounts for large propagation delays; we call this model rate limited-PS (RL-PS). The TCP-PS model analysis accommodates a general file size distribution by approximating it with a mixture of exponentials. The RL-PS model can be used for general file size distributions. We show that the TCP-PS model converges to the standard PS model as the propagation delay approaches zero. We also observe that the PS model provides very poor estimates of throughput unless the propagation delay is very small. We observe that the key parameters affecting the throughput are the bandwidth delay product (BDP), file size distribution, the link buffer and the traffic intensity. Several numerical comparisons between analytical and simulation results are provided. We observe that the TCP-PS model is accurate when the BDP is small compared to the mean file size, and the RL-PS model works well when the BDP is large compared to the mean file size.", "authors": ["Arzad Alam Kherani", "Anurag Kumar"], "n_citation": 84, "references": ["19fd2686-d688-4667-b07e-47be406f29f2", "424f2255-521f-4c89-8c4f-7137ff20bcd2", "5c271d49-1d58-4aec-89eb-cea9ac926c14", "61f1e9de-09c9-4d37-aac0-fbf16c7b70a7", "6b0ac2f1-d418-4cf8-9641-ad4969aae0d2", "987bf791-88f9-42d5-92af-894882950016", "a0ac4524-3393-4f4a-91f7-222a522f0be5", "b1dfee62-882f-4cf0-a252-39989350d975", "b3a8234e-4125-4067-9cb4-95d9bdbc9dec", "b5a0fc66-a990-4c1e-878f-923e74fa99d7", "bcaf96a6-a570-41e6-91ab-b688a2338b58", "cca8a182-5bad-45d6-8091-d11882e3f2ba", "dcfaaf88-edad-4ec3-9aee-feb06cd04421", "fb12a191-07ba-4fdf-91bd-19773b588c4a"], "title": "Stochastic models for throughput analysis of randomly arriving elastic flows in the Internet", "venue": "international conference on computer communications", "year": 2002, "id": "b3a8a7bf-6d67-4c3b-b57d-f17904dbbe0b"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents an intra-process dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique targeted toward non real-time applications running on an embedded system platform. The key idea is to make use of runtime information about the external memory access statistics in order to perform CPU voltage and frequency scaling with the goal of minimizing the energy consumption while translucently controlling the performance penalty. The proposed DVFS technique relies on dynamically-constructed regression models that allow the CPU to calculate the expected workload and slack time for the next time slot, and thus, adjust its voltage and frequency in order to save energy while meeting soft timing constraints. This is in turn achieved by estimating and exploiting the ratio of the total off-chip access time to the total on-chip computation time.

{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#The Automatic Identification System (AIS) is a VHF communication system that provides identification/location information to vessels and shore stations by exchanging data such as position, identification, course, speed, etc. Recently, the interest in detecting and tracking ships at distances from coastlines larger than what can be accomplished by normal terrestrial VHF communications has grown, driven by requirements of long-range applications such as better handling of hazardous cargo, improved security and countering illegal operations. This paper presents an extension of AIS to a long-range positioning reporting through a constellation of LEO satellites. It outlines technical challenges like the high rate of message collisions from ships in the field of view of a satellite. Technical solutions are proposed at system and sub-system level to address these challenges. A computer-based system simulator is used to assess the system performance and carry out a high-level system sizing. Results show that a relatively small constellation of LEO satellites can guarantee good ship position detection probability as well as a reporting time interval of a few hours. System performance aspects to be addressed in future work are the possible impact of terrestrial mobile communications interference as well as variations of the estimated traffic data.

{"abstract": "XML is studied and used as a key technology in many research and applications today. Accordingly there is an increasing need for the efficient XML document retrieval. Bitmap indexing is an efficient technique for determining true and false fast and it has been used mainly for reducing search extent rather than retrieving data. BitCube, an existing three-dimensional bitmap indexing for XML document retrieval, constructs bitmap from the entire index. In case high volumes of documents are loaded in a single cluster, however, this causes significant performance degradation in memory usage and operation speed. xPlaneb which is another bitmap indexing technique solves this problem by reconstructing three-dimensional bitmap index of BitCube using linked list. xPlaneb, however, has a high memory usage problem compared with BitCube when low volumes of documents are loaded because BitCube index consists of small field of one bits. This paper proposes X-Square which is a hybrid of BitCube and xPlaneb. X-Square takes both advantages of BitCube and xPlaneb. Experimental results show that X-Square has better performance in memory usage than xPlaneb and BitCube although the operation speed is a bit worse than xPlaneb.", "authors": ["Jaemin Lee", "Byung-Yeon Hwang", "Bogju Lee"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["3453caf3-77f8-4680-893a-9609c5fa64ea"], "title": "X-Square: A Hybrid Three-Dimensional Bitmap Indexing for XML Document Retrieval", "venue": "web information systems engineering", "year": 2004, "id": "ad840534-165d-4280-b602-053f9ec73987"}

{"abstract": "We present a sparse dynamic programming algorithm that, given two strings s and t , a gap penalty \u03bb, and an integer p, computes the value of the gap-weighted length-p subsequences kernel. The algorithm works in time O(p |M| log |t|), where M = {(i,j) | si = tj} is the set of matches of characters in the two sequences. The algorithm is easily adapted to handle bounded length subsequences and different gap-penalty schemes, including penalizing by the total length of gaps and the number of gaps as well as incorporating character-specific match/gap penalties.The new algorithm is empirically evaluated against a full dynamic programming approach and a trie-based algorithm both on synthetic and newswire article data. Based on the experiments, the full dynamic programming approach is the fastest on short strings, and on long strings if the alphabet is small. On large alphabets, the new sparse dynamic programming algorithm is the most efficient. On medium-sized alphabets the trie-based approach is best if the maximum number of allowed gaps is strongly restricted.", "authors": ["Juho Rousu", "John Shawe-Taylor"], "n_citation": 54, "references": ["01f15552-88f8-48ca-a75a-663822a6199a", "2880319c-c0a0-4f4f-92c2-8945175154cf", "28ec4934-a067-4b61-8c65-464fead521f8", "2da998e0-c787-4081-8f36-d7dc40284756", "3c383c6f-3503-458d-bdd7-a34cb8f4515f", "5f8feb36-c7b6-4d23-a118-00b59f962f95", "61bc81a5-52b7-4eff-89ad-0bce55dd290d", "6f18ce4a-d6e0-41e8-82e2-7b8b97f3816f", "9b3fc334-7ee0-4d93-8eff-9c59a78ea978", "a916da2d-dae1-4627-bb17-b0f978dc208d", "b546dd1a-7e2d-4527-ba3c-2e6ce5e0a405", "b70da948-06c7-468f-a4db-5e718eadb3c7", "e957957c-3edc-465f-84d8-a9e2b485c059", "e9abffef-c6bf-44da-a673-be480773dbbb", "fad419f7-a267-4501-a5c7-f197af9ae026"], "title": "Efficient Computation of Gapped Substring Kernels on Large Alphabets", "venue": "Journal of Machine Learning Research", "year": 2005, "id": "e8fba9b4-d8a9-4ac5-8e30-4c66e65a56ec"}

Methods: Adjectival modifiers are removed from terms extracted from the corpus (three million noun phrases extracted from MEDLINE), and demodified terms are searched for in the terminology (UMLS Metathesaurus, restricted to disorders and procedures). A phrase from MEDLINE becomes a candidate term in the Metathesaurus if the following two requirements are met: 1) a demodified term created from this phrase is found in the terminology and 2) the modifiers removed to create the demodified term also modify existing terms from the terminology, for a given semantic category. A manual review of a sample of candidate terms was performed. Results: Out of the 3 million simple phrases randomly extracted from MEDLINE, 125,000 new terms were identified for inclusion in the UMLS. 83% of the 1000 terms reviewed manually were associated with a relevant UMLS concept.

Signed-digit representations limit carry-propagation to one position to the left during the operations of addition and subtraction in digital computers.

The addition time for signed-digit numbers of any length is equal to the addition time for two digits.

Batching of requests coupled with a one-to-many delivery mechanism such as multicast can increase scalability and efficiency. There is very little insight into pricing such services in a manner that utilizes network and system resources efficiently while also maximizing the expectation of revenue. In this paper, we investigate simple, yet effective mechanisms to price content in a batching context. We observe that if customer behavior is well understood and temporally invariant, a fixed pricing scheme can maximize expectation of revenue if there are infinite resources. However, with constrained resources and potentially unknown customer behavior, only a dynamic pricing algorithm can maximize expectation of revenue. We formulate the problem of pricing as a constrained optimization problem and show that maximizing the expectation of revenue can be intractable even when the customer behavior is well known. Since customer behavior is unlikely to be well known in an Internet setting, we develop a model to understand customer behavior online and a pricing algorithm based on this model. Using simulations, we characterize the performance of this algorithm and other simple and deployable pricing schemes under different customer behavior and system load profiles.

Importantly, GA and the gradient descent learning algorithm are used alternatively in an iterative manner to adjust the parameters until the error is less than the required value. Unlike traditional methods, we not only consider the data of the prediction factor, but also consider the hybrid factors related to the prediction factor.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of routing connections with quality of service (QoS) requirements across networks when the information available for making routing decisions is inaccurate. Such uncertainty about the actual state of a network component arises naturally in a number of different environments. The goal of the route selection process is then to identify a path that is most likely to satisfy the QoS requirements. For end-to-end delay guarantees, this problem is intractable. However, we show that by decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local delay constraints, efficient and tractable solutions can be established. Moreover, we argue that such decomposition better reflects the interoperability between the routing and reservation phases. We first consider the simpler problem of decomposing the end-to-end constraint into local constraints for a given path. We show that, for general distributions, this problem is also intractable. Nonetheless, by defining a certain class of probability distributions, which includes typical distributions, and restricting ourselves to that class, we are able to establish efficient and exact solutions.

{"abstract": "In human-human communication, dialogue participants are con-tinuously sending and receiving signals on the status of the inform-ation being exchanged. We claim that if spoken dialogue systems were able to detect such cues and change their strategy accordingly, the interaction between user and systemwould improve. Therefore, the goals of the present study are as follows: (i) to find out which positive and negative cues people actually use in human-machine interaction in response to explicit and implicit verification questions and (ii) to see which (combinations of) cues have the best predictive potential for spotting the presence or absence of problems. It was found that subjects systematically use negative/marked cues (more words, marked word order, more repetitions and corrections, less new information etc.) when there are communication problems. Using precision and recall matrices it was found that various combinations of cues are accurate problem spotters. This kind of information may turn out to be highly relevant for spoken dia-logue systems, e.g., by providing quantitative criteria for changing the dialogue strategy or speech recognition engine.", "authors": ["Emiel Krahmer", "Marc Swerts", "Mari\u00ebt Theune", "Mieke F.

{"abstract": "We introduce a new model of ad-hoc mobile networks, which we call hierarchical, that are comprised of dense subnetworks of mobile users (corresponding to highly populated geographical areas, such as cities), interconnected across access ports by sparse but frequently used connections (such as highways). For such networks, we present an efficient routing protocol which extends the idea (introduced in [4]) of exploiting the co-ordinated motion of a small part of an ad-hoc mobile network (the \u201csupport\u201d) to achieve very fast communication between any two mobile users of the network. The basic idea of the new protocol presented here is, instead of using a unique (large) support for the whole network, to employ a hierarchy of (small) supports (one for each city) and also take advantage of the regular traffic of mobile users across the interconnection highways to communicate between cities. We combine here theoretical analysis (average case estimations based on random walk properties) and experimental implementations (carried out using the LEDA platform) to claim and validate results showing that such a hierarchical routing approach is, for this class of ad-hoc mobile networks, significantly more efficient than a simple extension of the basic \u201csupport\u201d idea presented in [4].", "authors": ["Ioannis Chatzigiannakis", "Sotiris E.

{"abstract": "This paper examines learning curves in the health care setting to determine whether organizations achieve performance improvements from cumulative experience at different rates. Although extensive research has shown that cumulative experience leads to performance improvement across numerous contexts, the question of how much of this improvement is due to mere experience and how much is due to collective learning processes has received little attention. We argue that organizational learning processes may allow some organizations to benefit more than others from equivalent levels of experience. We thus propose that learning curves can vary across organizations engaged in the same \"learning task,\" due to organizational learning effects. To investigate this proposition, we investigate cardiac surgery departments implementing a new technology for minimally invasive cardiac surgery. Data on operative procedure times from a sample of 660 patients who underwent the new operation at 16 different institutions are analyzed. The results confirm that cumulative experience is a significant predictor of learning, and further reveal that the slope of the learning curve varies significantly across organizations.

{"abstract": "Data centers are often under-utilized due to over-provisioning as well as time-varying resource demands of typical enterprise applications. One approach to increase resource utilization is to consolidate applications in a shared infrastructure using virtualization. Meeting application-level quality of service (QoS) goals becomes a challenge in a consolidated environment as application resource needs differ. Furthermore, for multi-tier applications, the amount of resources needed to achieve their QoS goals might be different at each tier and may also depend on availability of resources in other tiers. In this paper, we develop an adaptive resource control system that dynamically adjusts the resource shares to individual tiers in order to meet application-level QoS goals while achieving high resource utilization in the data center. Our control system is developed using classical control theory, and we used a black-box system modeling approach to overcome the absence of first principle models for complex enterprise applications and systems. To evaluate our controllers, we built a testbed simulating a virtual data center using Xen virtual machines. We experimented with two multi-tier applications in this virtual data center: a two-tier implementation of RUBiS, an online auction site, and a two-tier Java implementation of TPC-W. Our results indicate that the proposed control system is able to maintain high resource utilization and meets QoS goals in spite of varying resource demands from the applications.", "authors": ["Pradeep Padala", "Kang G.

{"abstract": "Without good testing, systems cannot be made secure or robust. Without metrics for the quality and security of system components, no guarantees can be made about the systems they are used to construct. This paper describes how firms can make the testing process faster and more cost effective while simultaneously providing a reliable metric of quality as one of the outputs of the process. This is accomplished via a market for defect reports, in which testers maximize profits by minimizing the cost of finding defects. The power of competition is harnessed to ensure that testers are paid a fair price for the defects they discover, thereby aligning their incentives with those of the firm developing the system. The price to find, demonstrate, and report a defect that is set by the market serves as the measure of quality.", "authors": ["Stuart E.

{"abstract": "We describe  computation migration , a new technique that is based on compile-time program transformations, for accesing remote data in a distributed-memory parallel system. In contrast with RPC-style access, where the access is performed remotely, and with data migration, where the data is moved so that it is local, computation migration moves part of the current thread to the processor where the data resides. The access is performed at the remote processor, and the migrated thread portion continues to run on that same processor; this makes subsequent accesses in the thread portion local.  We describe an implementation of computation migration that consists of two parts: an implementation that migrates single activation frames, and a high-level language annotation that allows a programmer to express when migration is desired.

The algorithms are based on the causal delivery of log records where each record corresponds to one transaction instead of one operation. The first algorithm in this family is a pessimistic protocol that ensures serializability and guarantees strict executions. Since we expect the epidemic algorithms to be used in environments with low probability of conflicts among transactions, we develop a variant of the pessimistic algorithm which is optimistic in that transactions commit as soon as they terminate locally and inconsistencies are detected asynchronously as the effects of committed transactions propagate through the system. The last member of the family of epidemic algorithms is pessimistic and uses voting with quorums to resolve conflicts and improve transaction response time.

{"abstract": "This paper presents an efficient algorithm for solving a balanced regularization problem in the frame-based image restoration. The balanced regularization is usually formulated as a minimization problem, involving an  l  2  data-fidelity term, an  l  1  regularizer on sparsity of frame coefficients, and a penalty on distance of sparse frame coefficients to the range of the frame operator. In image restoration, the balanced regularization approach bridges the synthesis-based and analysis-based approaches, and balances the fidelity, sparsity, and smoothness of the solution. Our proposed algorithm for solving the balanced optimal problem is based on a variable splitting strategy and the classical alternating direction method. This paper shows that the proposed algorithm is fast and efficient in solving the standard image restoration with balanced regularization. More precisely, a regularized version of the Hessian matrix of the  l  2  data-fidelity term is involved, and by exploiting the related fast tight Parseval frame and the special structures of the observation matrices, the regularized Hessian matrix can perform quite efficiently for the frame-based standard image restoration applications, such as circular deconvolution in image deblurring and missing samples in image inpainting.

In order to improve accuracy, therefore, it is important to design complementary classifiers with respect to each other. The authors propose a method to design a classifier complementary to an existent one, which satisfies the requirements: (a) it can recognize patterns misrecognized by the existent classifier with high accuracy, and (b) the number of patterns which are correctly recognized by the existent classifier but turn out to be misrecognized after combination can be minimized. In the proposed method, features are obtained by projection of original features onto axes such that the scatter of projection of patterns of a given class is small and that the squared mean of projection of patterns misrecognized in the given class is large. As the discriminant function, Fisher's linear discriminant function is applied using not only linear terms but also quadratic terms. Through experiments using handwritten numeral data included in the NIST database, it has been confirmed that the requirements mentioned above are satisfied.

Starting point of our study is a recent proposal for a system called Alternating-time Temporal Epistemic Logic (ATEL). We show that, assuming that agents act under uncertainty in some states of the system, the notion of allowable strategy should be defined with some caution. Moreover, we demonstrate a subtle difference between an agent knowing that he has a suitable strategy and knowing the strategy itself. We also point out that the agents should be assumed similar epistemic capabilities in the semantics of both strategic and epistemic operators. Trying to implement these ideas, we propose two different modifications of ATEL. The first one, dubbed Alternating-time Temporal Observational Logic (ATOL), is a logic for agents with bounded recall of the past. With the second, ATEL-R*, we present a framework to reason about both perfect and imperfect recall, in which we also incorporate operators for reasoning about the past.

{"abstract": "Functional electrical stimulation (FES) of pedaling provides a means by which individuals with spinal cord injury can obtain cardiorespiratory exercise. However, the early onset of muscle fatigue is a limiting factor in the cardiorespiratory exercise obtained while pedaling an FES ergometer. One objective of this study was to determine muscle excitation timing patterns to increase muscle endurance in FES pedaling for three upper leg muscle groups and to compare these timing patterns to those used in a commercially available FES ergometer. The second objective was to determine excitation timing patterns for a lower leg muscle group in conjunction with the three upper leg muscle groups. The final objective was to determine the mechanical energy contributions of each of the muscle groups to drive the crank. To fulfill these objectives, we developed a forward dynamic simulation of FES pedaling to determine electrical stimulation on and off times that minimize the muscle stress-time integral of the stimulated muscles. The computed electrical stimulation on and off times differed from those utilized by a commercially available FES ergometer and resulted in 17% and 11% decrease in the muscle stress-time integral for the three upper leg muscle groups and four upper and lower leg muscle groups, respectively. Also, the duration of muscle activation by the hamstrings increased by 5% over a crank cycle for the computed stimulation on and off times, and the mechanical energy generated by the hamstrings increased by 20%. The lower leg muscle group did not generate sufficient mechanical energy to reduce the energy contributions of the upper leg muscle groups. The computed stimulation on and off times could prolong FES pedaling, and thereby provide improved cardiorespiratory and muscle training outcomes for individuals with spinal cord injury. Including the lower leg muscle group in FES pedaling could increase cardiorespiratory demand while not affecting the endurance of the muscles involved in the pedaling task.", "authors": ["Nils A.

{"abstract": "Although a number of studies have reported that force feedback gravity wells can improve performance in \"point-and-click\" tasks, there have been few studies addressing issues surrounding the use of gravity wells for multiple on-screen targets. This paper investigates the performance of users, both with and without motion-impairments, in a \"point-and-click\" task when an undesired haptic distractor is present. The importance of distractor location is studied explicitly. Results showed that gravity wells can still improve times and error rates, even on occasions when the cursor is pulled into a distractor. The greatest improvement is seen for the most impaired users. In addition to traditional measures such as time and errors, performance is studied in terms of measures of cursor movement along a path. Two cursor measures, angular distribution and temporal components, are proposed and their ability to explain performance differences is explored.", "authors": ["Faustina Hwang", "Simeon Keates", "Patrick Langdon", "P.

{"abstract": "Approximate joint diagonalization of a set of matrices is an essential tool in many blind source separation (BSS) algorithms. A common measure of the attained diagonalization of the set is the weighted least-squares (WLS) criterion. However, most well-known algorithms are restricted to finding an orthogonal diagonalizing matrix, relying on a whitening phase for the nonorthogonal factor. Often, such an approach implies unbalanced weighting, which can result in degraded performance. We propose an iterative alternating-directions algorithm for minimizing the WLS criterion with respect to a general (not necessarily orthogonal) diagonalizing matrix. Under some mild assumptions, we prove weak convergence in the sense that the norm of parameters update is guaranteed to fall below any arbitrarily small threshold within a finite number of iterations. We distinguish between Hermitian and symmetrical problems. Using BSS simulations results, we demonstrate the improvement in estimating the mixing matrix, resulting from the relaxation of the orthogonality restriction.", "authors": ["Arie Yeredor"], "n_citation": 444, "references": ["20071b25-7c90-494a-9525-586e3caad4d5", "276b162e-29ec-4831-ad19-f091c7ff2265", "2acf7918-7e66-4b46-96ac-193c9b79c279", "5b38ca35-a974-4203-9aa5-d8f4eaccc55a", "67bce244-8014-45d9-a05e-fe93942641ea", "7b899dee-62d3-4446-bfb5-8fdd384cc5d8", "9d054c72-dbe5-468c-a77f-e879fc8368ad", "ad63e63c-6e0d-430e-955e-8bdda9975d9f", "c34127a1-0ddc-44d1-8e5e-ccb1d4af87d3", "cb9096d3-2cfe-4d47-926e-66ff12d687c5", "dc2beba8-c7cc-4407-88be-e0e5cef35be3"], "title": "Non-orthogonal joint diagonalization in the least-squares sense with application in blind source separation", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "year": 2002, "id": "d10004d8-a4c0-492c-aa9d-b4a78fae5d46"}

The model is utilized for investigating how many packet data channels should be allocated for GPRS under a given amount of traffic in order to guarantee appropriate quality of service. The presented model constitutes a continuous-time Markov chain. The Markov model represents the sharing of radio channels by circuit switched GSM connections and packet switched GPRS sessions under a dynamic channel allocation scheme. In contrast to previous work, the Markov model explicitly represents the mobility of users by taking into account arrivals of new GSM and GPRS users as well as handovers from neighboring calls. Furthermore, we take into account TCP flow control for the GPRS data packets. To validate the simplifications necessary for making the Markov model amenable to numerical solution, we provide a comparison of the results of the Markov model with a detailed simulator on the network level.", "authors": ["Christoph Lindemann", "Axel Th\u00fcmmler"], "n_citation": 93, "references": ["063e1b6b-585c-4180-890e-99682525718e", "0897faba-25ce-482c-ac78-eb139a228347", "0a6f3371-995d-410e-a58d-ca96abbfc51e", "6019c6b6-5da8-4e0f-907b-feb3cae25733", "6fa8d6b8-defd-4647-904d-09b08669e9cd", "715dc497-8561-4180-9f5c-7cfe465db132", "9efefea1-9483-4e02-bd01-88ae777335e2", "a20de26e-8ddb-49ec-b252-07c980eb01da", "b3ccb5a6-0a11-4e69-ad57-115302232adc", "c86ac16b-f72d-419f-8f51-7dd6b248cc24"], "title": "Performance analysis of the general packet radio service", "venue": "Computer Networks", "year": 2003, "id": "b01eab12-7d04-48e8-8a6c-6ca9608248ec"}

In contrast to existing approaches enhancing model checking through performing parallel matrix operations on the GPU, we parallelize the breadth-first layered construction of the state space graph. For efficient processing, the input model is translated to the reverse Polish notation, resulting in a representation as an integer vector. The proposed GPU exploration algorithm then divides into two parallel stages. In the first stage, each state is replaced with a Boolean vector to denote which transitions are enabled. In the second stage, pairs consisting of replicated states and enabled transition IDs are copied to the GPU then all transitions are applied in parallel to produce the successors. Bitstate hashing is used as a Bloom filter to remove duplicates from the set of successors in RAM. The experiments show speed-ups of about one order of magnitude.

{"abstract": "A central problem in learning in complex environments is balancing exploration of untested actions against exploitation of actions that are known to be good. The benefit of exploration can be estimated using the classical notion of Value of Information-the expected improvement in future decision quality that might arise from the information acquired by exploration. Estimating this quantity requires an assessment of the agent's uncertainty about its current value estimates for states. In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian approach to maintaining this uncertain information. We extend Watkins' Q-learning by maintaining and propagating probability distributions over the Q-values. These distributions are used to compute a myopic approximation to the value of information for each action and hence to select the action that best balances exploration and exploitation.

To tackle the scheduling problem, eTrack introduces a first-of-its-kind closed-loop coverage control technique that allocates resources of sensor nodes for each target in proportion with its required tracking accuracy. To handle the identity management problem, eTrack exploits the fact that targets prefer certain paths through a mixing region and takes advantage of the spatio-temporal correlation of events detected by different sensor nodes within the mixing region for the same target. Simulation results that eTrack significantly reduces the computation and communication overhead with mixing regions while achieving better tracking accuracy than existing multiple target tracking techniques.", "authors": ["Hidayet Ozgur Sanli", "Hasan Cam"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["24f63fb5-77e9-44ea-b9de-517dafcb5818", "3c24e98a-ef68-4e47-bb92-09ec0991ea0a", "7e74ee40-25ad-461b-95e7-14ed7e1e9755", "7efa5768-3ec1-45cf-8307-62579c4bca6c", "9849930a-a2a8-4157-a77f-a28dddee54f5", "99d73311-7908-4108-9bae-8db9e08158a0", "c2e07117-43ad-48cb-b701-882fc6dafb8d", "c9b6480d-5fe3-4931-be22-0ef5bfd29881", "e8ffa661-c577-45d7-ab2d-39297c13bed3", "f1580e55-32fc-479f-bff6-a5fe1819a0fc"], "title": "Joint Coverage Scheduling and Identity Management for Multiple-Target Tracking in Wireless Sensor Networks", "venue": "global communications conference", "year": 2008, "id": "486dddb7-5fd5-48f1-ac4a-a2f33c80b801"}
{"abstract": "The problem of dynamic sensor activation for event diagnosis in partially observed discrete event systems is considered. Diagnostic agents are able to activate sensors dynamically during the evolution of the system. Sensor activation policies for diagnostic agents are functions that determine which sensors are to be activated after the occurrence of a trace of events. The sensor activation policy must satisfy the property of diagnosability of centralized systems or codiagnosability of decentralized systems. A policy is said to be minimal if there is no other policy, with strictly less sensor activation, that achieves diagnosability or codiagnosability. To compute minimal policies, we propose language partition methods that lead to efficient computational algorithms. Specifically, we define ''window-based'' language partitions for scalable algorithms to compute minimal policies. By refining partitions, one is able to refine the solution space over which minimal solutions are computed at the expense of more computation. Thus a compromise can be achieved between fineness of solution and complexity of computation.", "authors": ["Weilin Wang", "St\u00e9phane Lafortune", "Anouck R.

{"abstract": "Most benign breast tumors possess well-defined, sharp boundaries that delineate them from surrounding tissues, as opposed to malignant tumors. Computer techniques proposed to date for tumor analysis have concentrated on shape factors of tumor regions and texture measures. While shape measures based on contours of tumor regions can indicate differences in shape complexities between circumscribed and spiculated tumors, they are not designed to characterize the density variations across the boundary of a tumor. Here, the authors propose a region-based measure of image edge profile acutance which characterizes the transition in density of a region of interest (ROI) along normals to the ROI at every boundary pixel. The authors investigate the potential of acutance in quantifying the sharpness of the boundaries of tumors, and propose its application to discriminate between benign and malignant mammographic tumors. In addition, they study the complementary use of various shape factors based upon the shape of the ROI, such as compactness. Fourier descriptors, moments, and chord-length statistics to distinguish between circumscribed and spiculated tumors. Thirty-nine images from the Mammographic Image Analysis Society (MIAS) database and an additional set of 15 local cases were selected for this study. The cases included 16 circumscribed benign, 7 circumscribed malignant, 12 spiculated benign, and 19 spiculated malignant lesions. All diagnoses were proven by pathologic examinations of resected tissue. The contours of the lesions were first marked by an expert radiologist using X-Paint and X-Windows on a SUN-SPARCstation 2 Workstation. For computation of acutance, the ROI boundaries were iteratively approximated using a split/merge and end-point adjustment technique to obtain the best-fitting polygonal approximation. The jackknife method using the Mahalanobis distance measure in the BMDP (Biomedical Programs) package was used for classification of the lesions using acutance and the shape factors as features in various combinations. Acutance alone resulted in a benign/malignant classification accuracy of 95% the MIAS cases. Compactness alone gave a circumscribed/spiculated classification rate of 92.3% with the MIAS cases. Acutance in combination with a moment-based shape measure and a Fourier descriptor-based measure gave four-group classification rate of 95% with the MIAS cases. The results indicate the importance of including lesion edge definition with shape information for classification of tumors, and that the proposed measure of acutance fills this need.", "authors": ["Rangaraj M.

{"abstract": "Concurrent programs are well known for containing errors that are difficult to detect, reproduce, and diagnose. Deadlock is a common concurrency error, which occurs when a set of threads are blocked, due to each attempting to acquire a lock held by another. This paper presents a collection of highly scalable static and dynamic techniques for exposing potential deadlocks. The basis is a known algorithm, which, when locks are acquired in a nested fashion, captures the nesting order in a lock graph. A cycle in the graph indicates a deadlock potential. We propose three extensions to this basic algorithm to eliminate, or label as low severity, false warnings of possible deadlocks (false positives). These false positives may be due to cycles within one thread, cycles guarded by a gate lock (an enclosing lock that prevents deadlocks), and cycles involving several code fragments that cannot possibly execute in parallel. We also present a technique that combines information from multiple runs of the program into a single lock graph, to find deadlock potentials that would not be revealed by analyzing one run at a time. Finally, this paper describes the use of static analysis to automatically reduce the overhead of dynamic checking for deadlock potentials.", "authors": ["Rahul Agarwal", "Saddek Bensalem", "Eitan Farchi", "Klaus Havelund", "Yarden Nir-Buchbinder", "Scott D.

Based on real geographic data, we perform a detailed empirical performance evaluation and compare the cluster organization to other organization models not using global clustering. We will show that global clustering speeds up the processing of window queries as well as spatial joins without decreasing the performance of the insertion of new objects and of selective queries such as point queries.

Our approach is based on the introduction of auxiliary dynamical systems (playing the role of velocity observers in a certain sense) to generate the individual and relative damping terms in the absence of the actual angular velocities and relative angular velocities. Our main focus, in this technical note, is to address the following two problems: 1) Design a velocity-free attitude tracking and synchronization control scheme, that allows the team members to align their attitudes and track a time-varying reference trajectory (simultaneously). 2) Design a velocity-free synchronization control scheme, in the case where no reference attitude is specified, and all spacecraft are required to reach a consensus by aligning their attitudes with the same final time-varying attitude. In this work, one important and novel feature (besides the non-requirement of the angular velocity measurements), consists in the fact that the control torques are naturally bounded and the designer can arbitrarily assign the desired bounds on the control torques,  a priori , through the control gains, regardless of the angular velocities.

{"abstract": "Investigations of network security breaches are both complex and costly. Even a moderate amount of forensic preparation in an organization can mitigate the impact of a major incident and can enable the organization to obtain restitution. A case study of an intrusion is outlined in which the victim organization worked with law enforcement agencies to apprehend the perpetrator. This case study contains examples of challenges that can arise during this type of investigation, and discusses practical steps that an organization can take to prepare for a major incident. The overlapping roles of System Administrators, Incident Handlers, and Forensic Examiners in a network intrusion are explored, with an emphasis on the need for collaboration and proper evidence handling. This case study also shows how effective case management and methodical reconstruction of events can help create a more complete picture of the crime and help establish links between computer intruders and their illegal activities.", "authors": ["Eoghan Casey"], "n_citation": 16, "title": "Case study: Network intrusion investigation - lessons in forensic preparation", "venue": "Digital Investigation", "year": 2005, "id": "798c4f32-41f3-4154-bfb7-1d1a784afafd"}
{"abstract": "An important implementation decision in polymorphically typed functional programming language is whether to represent data in boxed or unboxed form and when to transform them from one representation to the other. Using a language with explicit representation types and boxing/unboxing operations we axiomatize equationally the set of all explicitly boxed versions, called  completions , of a given source program. In a two-stage process we give some of the equations a rewriting interpretation that captures eliminating boxing/unboxing operations without relying on a specific implementation or even semantics of the underlying language. The resulting reduction systems operate on congruence classes of completions defined by the remaining equations  E , which can  be understood as moving boxing/unboxing operations along data flow paths in the source program. We call a completion  e opt  formally optimal  if every other completion for the same program (and at the same representation type) reduces to  e opt   under this two-stage reduction.  We show that every source program has formally optimal completions, which are unique modulo  E . This is accomplished by first \u201cpolarizing\u201d the equations in  E  and orienting them to obtain two canonical (confluent and strongly normalizing) rewriting systems. The completions produced by Leroy's and Poulsen's algorithms are generally not formally optimal in our sense.  The rewriting systems have  been implemented and applied to some simple Standard ML programs. Our results show that the amount of boxing and unboxing operations is also in practice substantially reduced in comparison to Leroy's completions. This analysis is intended to be integrated into Tofte's region-based implementation of Standard ML currently underway at DIKU.", "authors": ["Fritz Henglein", "Jesper J\u00f8rgensen"], "n_citation": 76, "references": ["08e3dbcd-e01f-47c5-86cd-dfa7cb396c6e", "35e42283-c1a0-4c2c-a150-f2217e2bc406", "639bc67d-ead6-43c7-a7f1-0fc3027fba8e", "6ea787d2-47e4-4594-aed6-2748cac825f1", "7f9ca117-de6d-4c5b-8e4a-947aab3e1fec", "801d79fc-df14-436f-9350-568e22ff92c3", "a42b0711-68b1-4490-8eda-bbcffb00921d", "b5cc3906-2ac1-45cd-bbf6-de94b8a65c1b", "d4f5860d-0fa6-4ffd-b940-b0773b27b0ad", "d829589f-9900-4ba2-9948-543e969c74d2", "e1e554b6-ef93-435f-9f6d-009fc7cca820", "e435c51c-247b-4386-8238-0f4d5d754eca", "e955b928-fc12-4e79-84d1-e936ea6a49d7", "edb7a8e6-909c-42eb-9a92-b3653fbefa83", "f7867b82-b89d-415a-9aca-1ccc4844731e"], "title": "Formally optimal boxing", "venue": "symposium on principles of programming languages", "year": 1994, "id": "5f8680a9-9872-447d-b6f4-946f42f6129a"}

Most importantly, automatic composition can provide access methods for all activities on the WWW. As a result of this popularity, a number of people are researching this area.

{"abstract": "Abstract   Most previous attempts at producing word classes (thesauri) by statistical analysis have used very limited distributional information such as word co-occurrence in a document or a sentence. This paper describes an automatic procedure which uses the syntactic relations as the basis for grouping words into classes. It forms classes by grouping together nouns that occur as subject (or object) of the same verbs, and similarly by grouping together verbs occurring with the same subject or object. The program was applied to a small corpus of sentences in a subfield of pharmacology. This procedure yielded the word classes for the subfield, in good agreement with the word classes recognized by pharmacologists. The word classes can be used to describe the informational patterns that occur in texts of the subfield, to disambiguate parses of a sentence, and perhaps to improve the performance of current information retrieval systems.", "authors": ["Lynette Hirschman", "Ralph Grishman", "Naomi Sager"], "n_citation": 112, "references": ["a4786848-6e4c-4f25-91b7-2c9c77e40c2d", "b890b439-6915-4b95-bdaa-62c4cd66388b", "c3f97c38-8db9-44de-b19d-1021fca1af69"], "title": "Grammatically-Based Automatic Word Class Formation.", "venue": "Information Processing and Management", "year": 1975, "id": "acdf4140-0647-438d-868c-3b13a2c3bc60"}

{"abstract": "Reducing power consumption has become a crucial design tenet for both mobile and other small computing devices that are not constantly connected to a power source. However, unlike devices that have a limited and predefined set of functionality, recent mobile smart phone devices have a very rich set of components and can handle multiple general purpose programs that are not a-priori known or profiled. In this paper, we present a general methodology for collecting measurements and modelling power usage on smart phones. Our goal is to characterize the device subsystems and perform accurate power measurements. We implemented a system that effectively accounts for the power usage of all of the primary hardware subsystems on the phone: CPU, display, graphics, GPS, audio, microphone, and Wi-Fi.

{"abstract": "The Hebbian neural learning algorithm that implements Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can be extended for the analysis of more realistic forms of neural data by including higher than two-channel correlations and non-Euclidean 1p metrics. Maximizing a dth rank tensor form which correlates d channels is equivalent to raising the exponential order of variance correlation from 2 to d in the algorithm that implements PCA. Simulations suggest that a generalized version of Oja's PCA neuron can detect such a dth order principal component. Arguments from biology and pattern recognition suggest that neural data in general is not symmetric about its mean; performing PCA with an implicit 1l metric rather than the Euclidean metric weights exponentially distributed vectors according to their probability, as does a highly nonlinear Hebb rule. The correlation order d and the 1p metric exponent p were each roughly constant for each of several Hebb rules simulated. High-order correlation analysis may prove increasingly useful as data from large networks of cells engaged in information processing becomes available.", "authors": ["William R. Softky", "Daniel M.

The analogous result is known to hold by a folklore random coding argument for the case of non-linear codes, but the linear case is more subtle and has remained open.We prove our result by exhibiting an infinite family of binary linear codes of \"large\" minimum distance with a super-polynomial number (in blocklength) of codewords all within a Hamming ball of radius close to the Johnson bound. Even the existence of codes with a super-polynomial number of codewords in a ball of radius bounded away from the minimum distance (let alone radius close to the Johnson bound) was open prior to our work.

{"abstract": "Reuse of domain models is often limited to the reuse of the structural aspects of the domain (e.g. by means of generic data models). In object-oriented models, reuse of dynamic aspects is achieved by reusing the methods of domain classes. Because in the object-oriented approach any behavior is attached to a class, it is impossible to reuse behavior without at the same time reusing the class. In addition, because of the message passing paradigm, object interaction must be specified as a method attached to one class which is invoked by another class. In this way object interaction is hidden in the behavioral aspects of classes. This makes object interaction schemas difficult to reuse and customize. The focus of this paper is on improving the reuse of object-oriented domain models. This is achieved by centering the behavioral aspects around the concept of business events.", "authors": ["Monique Snoeck", "Geert Poels"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["05342eb2-391b-47aa-ba7d-757cef19b0a6", "0f128db0-b5da-4979-9525-706e09a9de6e", "3f1a0fb8-770c-4e27-bb60-809d99eaf1c8", "41f23592-7546-4143-87df-a15bcd98ae1c", "50189eb4-52fc-4a6a-86ee-6a7b279e1e4e", "8c62e9aa-e102-4285-ac5b-69ba005bce51", "8d1688b3-232b-4c48-80f6-d7f5e1b732d8", "8f467997-aa17-4759-b36b-90d0ad92268a", "9373b0cd-a177-4605-87f5-f54559c494c2", "b2f7f088-f746-4ff7-a08e-952de99194b0", "daa1d519-0370-491b-90ae-dca562b7aacb"], "title": "Improving the reuse possibilities of the behavioral aspects of object-oriented domain models", "venue": "international conference on conceptual modeling", "year": 2000, "id": "7db07eeb-3d3d-4bc4-b802-a90ebf54475a"}
{"abstract": "A position tracking control system is developed for a rotorcraft-based unmanned aerial vehicle (RUAV) using robust integral of the signum of the error (RISE) feedback and neural network (NN) feedforward terms. While the typical NN-based adaptive controller guarantees uniformly ultimately bounded stability, the proposed NN-based adaptive control system guarantees semi-global asymptotic tracking of the RUAV using the RISE feedback control. The developed control system consists of an inner-loop and outer-loop. The inner-loop control system determines the attitude of the RUAV based on an adaptive NN-based linear dynamic model inversion (LDI) method with the RISE feedback. The outer-loop control system generates the attitude reference corresponding to the given position, velocity, and heading references, and controls the altitude of the RUAV by the LDI method with the RISE feedback. The linear model for the LDI is obtained by a linearization of the nonlinear RUAV dynamics during hover flight. Asymptotic tracking of the attitude and altitude states is proven by a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, and a numerical simulation is performed on the nonlinear RUAV model to validate the effectiveness of the controller.", "authors": ["Jongho Shin", "H.

{"abstract": "The performances of the current face recognition systems suffer heavily from the variations in lighting. To deal with this problem, this paper presents an illumination normalization approach by relighting face images to a canonical illumination based on the harmonic images model. Benefiting from the observations that human faces share similar shape, and the albedos of the face surfaces are quasi-constant, we first estimate the nine low-frequency components of the illumination from the input facial image. The facial image is then normalized to the canonical illumination by re-rendering it using the illumination ratio image technique. For the purpose of face recognition, two kinds of canonical illuminations, the uniform illumination and a frontal flash with the ambient lights, are considered, among which the former encodes merely the texture information, while the latter encodes both the texture and shading information. Our experiments on the CMU-PIE face database and the Yale B face database have shown that the proposed relighting normalization can significantly improve the performance of a face recognition system when the probes are collected under varying lighting conditions.", "authors": ["Laiyun Qing", "Shiguang Shan", "Wen Gao", "Bo Du"], "n_citation": 33, "references": ["0b4adacc-78a1-4851-916a-9fbeab0fe7c4", "0ca59764-4f3f-472c-9880-e9934a7bd979", "32d158dc-6f9f-426a-973b-8edc5e4c5dad", "3d7f1929-7aa4-4553-bf39-30b7863523be", "56f4b72a-ec39-47ac-8220-899296e7fb18", "599c6c79-eb7d-4c3b-b900-d49ab1e0fe3c", "5e8b0e8a-d687-4333-bfe9-73b4c1bebde5", "831a0211-1a23-4f1e-86bb-bd9496ad765d", "894c5634-efa9-4c2b-8360-d559fa002748", "8a1dc9e1-78f3-4e07-b868-10ea4613f3d5", "9025d4f2-c1f7-4aa1-9632-a859a845a2d4", "a149919e-1c00-4ef2-8535-60634a5532a4", "bf1d8c69-aefb-4a7a-8b02-f815b754833c", "c23df197-74d6-4d07-b1e5-2492bd49ae2a", "c8cc88b8-d971-49e9-8810-e784c856872f", "cacef546-cc48-4fb9-814f-9c12141662d8", "d75d2735-844d-4446-ac4e-1677e338e624"], "title": "FACE RECOGNITION UNDER GENERIC ILLUMINATION BASED ON HARMONIC RELIGHTING", "venue": "International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2005, "id": "4117bff0-88e9-47bd-be30-a3dffac59dd3"}

{"abstract": "Data structure corruptions are insidious bugs that reduce the reliability of software systems. Constraint-based datastructure repair promises to help programs recover from potentially crippling corruption errors. Prior work repairs a variety of relatively small data structures, usually with hundreds of nodes.   We present STARC which uses static analysis to repair data structures with tens of thousands of nodes. Given a Java predicate method that describes the integrity constraints of a structure, STARC statically analyzes the method to identify: (1) the recurrent fields, i.e., fields that the predicate method uses to traverse the structure; and (2) local field constraints, i.e., how the value of an object field is related to the value of a neighboring object field. STARC executes the predicate method on the structure and monitors its execution to identify corrupt object fields, which STARC then repairs using a systematic search of a neighborhood of the given structure. Each repair action is guided by the result of the static analysis, which enables more efficient and effective repair compared to prior work. Experimental results showthat STARC can repair structures with tens of thousands of nodes, up to 100 times larger than prior work.   STARC efficiency is probably not practical for very large data structures in deployed systems, but opens a promising direction for future work.", "authors": ["Bassem Elkarablieh", "Sarfraz Khurshid", "Duy Vu", "Kathryn S.

Huge benefits regarding the reduction of time-to-markets, reduction of effort, and quality improvement have been reported as a result of adopting a product line approach. Since a product line program involves major investments, considerable risks are associated with it. Thus, it is important to evaluate at the start of a product line project, i.e., before the major investments are performed, its potential benefits and risks. In this paper we describe an approach that allows to identify the benefits and risks in a systematic manner, thus enabling the early development of risk-avoiding measures.

{"abstract": "Given the small bit allocation for motion information in very low bit-rate coding, motion compensation using the block matching (BMA) algorithm fails to maintain an acceptable level of prediction errors. The reason is that the motion model, or spatial transformation, assumed in block matching cannot approximate the motion in the real world precisely with a small number of parameters (i.e. motion vectors). To develop an effective motion compensation method for very low bit-rate video coding, The authors address the issues of 1) adopting more sophisticated spatial transformations than block matching, and 2) developing a motion estimation algorithm that is suitable for these spatial transformations. The spatial transformations discussed are affine transformation, bilinear transformation and perspective transformation. Two new motion estimation algorithms, a matching-based algorithm and its fast version, are presented. The performance of the motion compensation methods, which combine the spatial transformations and the proposed motion estimation algorithms, is evaluated theoretically and experimentally using the following criteria: prediction error, amount of motion information, and computational cost. The simulation results show that in the proposed method, the amount of motion information required to achieve a fixed level of prediction error is reduced to one fourth that of block matching. The authors combine the designed motion compensation method with the discrete cosine transform to simulate coding of CIF format images at the transmission rate of 16 kb/s. >", "authors": ["Yuichiro Nakaya", "Hiroshi Harashima"], "n_citation": 388, "references": ["5e29c1d4-2a4a-4b28-8835-a9dea9bb185d", "630a1be4-eafc-4280-aacc-e241691c29d2", "6c59bf4c-3520-4742-9d36-6ab5175bdda6", "9688aeb6-f5b6-4ddd-a832-e78d550af3af"], "title": "Motion compensation based on spatial transformations", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Circuits and Systems for Video Technology", "year": 1994, "id": "c63a2ddb-cf12-4d68-9760-025de4afd88a"}

{"abstract": "An essential aspect of programmers' work is the correctness of their code. This makes current HCI techniques ill-suited to analyze and design the programming systems that programmers use everyday, since these techniques focus more on problems with learnability and efficiency of use, and less on error-proneness.

The framework is based on both old and new studies of programming, as well as general research on the mechanisms of human error.

{"abstract": "In a typical very large scale integration/printed circuit board (VLSI/PCB) design, some modules are preplaced in advance, and the other modules are requested to be placed without overlap with each other and with these preplaced modules. The presence of such obstacles introduces inconsistency to a coding scheme, called sequence pair, which has been proposed for an obstacle free placement problem. We solve this difficulty by proposing a procedure called \"adaptation\" which transforms an inconsistent sequence pair to a consistent one with the utmost consideration for minimizing the modification. It is shown that a simulated annealing is well organized so that it tests only feasible placements by the adaptation procedure. As a design example, a Microelectronics Center of North Carolina (MCNC) benchmark data \"ami49\" is packed with treating ten modules among 49 modules as preplaced ones.

{"abstract": "Wavelet theory has a profound impact on signal processing as it offers a rigorous mathematical framework to the treatment of multiresolution problems. The combination of soft computing and wavelet theory has led to a number of new techniques. On the other hand, as a new generation of learning algorithms, support vector regression (SVR) was developed by Vapnik et al. recently, in which e-insensitive loss function was defined as a trade-off between the robust loss function of Huber and one that enables sparsity within the SVs. The use of support vector kernel expansion also provides us a potential avenue to represent nonlinear dynamical systems and underpin advanced analysis. However, for the support vector regression with the standard quadratic programming technique, the implementation is computationally expensive and sufficient model sparsity cannot be guaranteed. In this article, from the perspective of model sparsity, the linear programming support vector regression (LP-SVR) with wavelet kernel was proposed, and the connection between LP-SVR with wavelet kernel and wavelet networks was analyzed. In particular, the potential of the LP-SVR for nonlinear dynamical system identification was investigated.", "authors": ["Zhao Lu", "Jing Sun", "Ken Butts"], "n_citation": 38, "references": ["044bc22d-9fd3-4e53-8c3d-909b277a8601", "09556d05-aec0-40d2-83f1-16df6e504039", "36fba016-5e8a-449b-9257-95235402e295", "4bbd7777-9751-415d-bb7a-6ce26f6d9271", "948a791e-a967-4cda-97b9-09f9c00eacfc", "9836613c-d506-47ca-be5c-9b126f250ddc", "a083a1b9-8dfb-45d6-99a9-fa30c4a6e9f5", "ce7b221e-edb3-4c37-bbf1-a2996f3f65f1", "d28477a9-8c99-4e71-82f9-3aa2998a5496", "ec8e7ce2-f44d-473f-8654-8f0df25e6793", "ed39daac-748d-415e-8480-7359dd777395", "f685b04e-8f4b-449a-9b0f-9c4fef557304"], "title": "Linear programming support vector regression with wavelet kernel: A new approach to nonlinear dynamical systems identification", "venue": "Mathematics and Computers in Simulation", "year": 2009, "id": "5a1b6dbe-c1fb-4252-96ca-38b7b03fab34"}

A coordination control method was developed by decomposing the robotic deburring system into two subsystems: the arm and the deburring tool. A decentralized control approach was pursued in which suitable controllers were designed for the two subsystems in the coordination scheme. Robust feedback linearization was utilized to minimize the undesirable effect of external disturbances, such as static and Coulomb friction and nonlinear compliance of the pneumatic cylinder stemming from the compressibility of air. The developed coordination control method demonstrated its efficacy in terms of deburring accuracy and speed.

{"abstract": "To produce quality software and evolve them in an economic and timely fashion, enactable software process models are used for regulating development activities with the support of Process-Centered Software Engineering Environments (PCSEEs). However, due to the dynamically changing development environment, the developers do not always follow the process model in presence of unforeseen situations. As human with creativity and variant nature, each developer has his or her own way of doing development that may not be allowed by the process model. As a result, various inconsistencies arise in software processes and then the authority of the process model will be undermined. In this paper, we propose an algebraic approach to promote the efficient management of inconsistencies. With the approach, potential inconsistencies can be precisely detected and valuable diagnostic information is available to help process designers efficiently locate the detected inconsistencies. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated by experimenting it on an example process.", "authors": ["Qiusong Yang", "Mingshu Li", "Qing Wang", "Guowei Wen Yang", "Jian Zhai", "Juan D.

{"abstract": "Abstract   The objective of this paper is to present the theoretical basis and practical application of incremental development in the Cleanroom software engineering process. Incremental development is based on the mathematical principle of referential transparency. Cleanroom uses incremental development to build systems in a succession of cumulative subsets of user function. The increments accumulate top-down into the final product in a development and certification pipeline. Increment planning occurs after top-level specification, and results in a construction plan for the software. Factors determining the composition of increments include clarity of requirements, usage probability of user functions, reliability requirements for subsystems, coordination with the hardware development schedule, dependencies between functions, complexity, reuse, or other factors that pose risks to the project. Each increment involves a complete development and certification cycle. The first increment is a minimal system, and the final increment is the complete system. User feedback on each increment is a gauge on whether the right system is being built, and quality measures in each increment are a gauge on whether the system is being built right. Benefits of incremental development include customer feedback on the evolving system, intellectual control of the technical work, and management control of the schedule and budget. While incremental development may be used with other development methods, it is particularly effective when used with the formal methods in the Cleanroom process.", "authors": ["Carmen J.

These automata, together with the automaton modeling normal mode, describe a discrete-event system with faults.

We assume that fault-tolerant control takes actions (disablements) only when the occurrence of a fault is certain. We consider cases of both full event observation and partial event observation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of fault-tolerant control. We also provide formulas and algorithms to calculate control actions if the necessary and sufficient conditions are satisfied.

{"abstract": "We describe a framework and equations used to model and predict the behavior of multi- agent systems (MASs) with learning agents. A difference equation is used for calculating the progression of an agent's error in its decision function, thereby telling us how the agent is expected to fare in the MAS. The equation relies on parameters which capture the agent's learning abilities, such as its change rate, learning rate and retention rate, as well as relevant aspects of the MAS such as the impact that agents have on each other. We validate the framework with experimental results using reinforcement learning agents in a market system, as well as with other experimental results gathered from the AI literature. Finally, we use PAC-theory to show how to calculate bounds on the values of the learning With the steady increase in the number of multi-agent systems (MASs) with learning agents (5, 9, 10, 31) the analysis of these systems is becoming increasingly impor- tant. Some of the research in this area consists of experiments where a number of learning agents are placed in a MAS, then different learning or system parameters are varied and the results are gathered and analyzed in an effort to determine how changes in the individual agent behaviors will affect the system behavior. We have learned about the dynamics of market-based MASs using this approach (34). How- ever, in this article we will take a step beyond these observation-based experimental results and describe a framework that can be used to model and predict the behav- ior of MASs with learning agents. We give a difference equation that can be used to calculate the progression of an agent's error in its decision function. The equa- tion relies on the values of parameters which capture the agents' learning abilities and the relevant aspects of the MAS. We validate the framework by comparing its predictions with our own experimental results and with experimental results gath- ered from the AI literature. Finally, we show how to use probably approximately correct (PAC) theory to get bounds on the values of some of the parameters. The types of MAS we study are exemplified by the abstract representation shown in Figure 1.

Its purpose is to be a label which is holographically attached to the content. Moreover, it can only be removed by malicious and deliberate attacks (without a great loss of content quality) if some secret parameter K is known. In contrast, a watermark should be readily detectable by electronic means. This implies that electronic watermark detection is only feasible if the watermark detector is aware of the secret K. In many watermarking business scenarios the watermark detector will be available to the public as a black box D.

{"abstract": "Many popular scripting languages such as Ruby, Python, and Perl include highly dynamic language constructs, such as an eval method that evaluates a string as program text. While these constructs allow terse and expressive code, they have traditionally obstructed static analysis. In this paper we present PRuby, an extension to Diamondback Ruby (DRuby), a static type inference system for Ruby. PRuby augments DRuby with a novel dynamic analysis and transformation that allows us to precisely type uses of highly dynamic constructs. PRuby's analysis proceeds in three steps. First, we use run-time instrumentation to gather per-application profiles of dynamic feature usage. Next, we replace dynamic features with statically analyzable alternatives based on the profile. We also add instrumentation to safely handle cases when subsequent runs do not match the profile. Finally, we run DRuby's static type inference on the transformed code to enforce type safety.   We used PRuby to gather profiles for a benchmark suite of sample Ruby programs. We found that dynamic features are pervasive throughout the benchmarks and the libraries they include, but that most uses of these features are highly constrained and hence can be effectively profiled. Using the profiles to guide type inference, we found that DRuby can generally statically type our benchmarks modulo some refactoring, and we discovered several previously unknown type errors. These results suggest that profiling and transformation is a lightweight but highly effective approach to bring static typing to highly dynamic languages.", "authors": ["Michael Furr", "Jong-hoon (David) An", "Jeffrey S.

{"abstract": "Integration of multiple heterogeneous data sources continues to be a critical problem for many application domains and a challenge for researchers world-wide. One aspect of integration is the translation of schema and data across data model boundaries. Researchers in the past have looked at both customized algorithmic approaches as well as generic meta-modeling approaches as viable solutions. We now take the meta-modeling approach the next step-forward. In this paper we propose a flexible, extensible and re-usable transformation modeling framework which allows users to (1) model their transformations; (2) to choose from a set of possible execution strategies to translate the underlying schema and data; and (3) to access and re-use a library of transformation generators. In this paper we present the core of our modeling framework - a set of cross algebra operators that covers the class of linear transformations, and two different techniques of composing these operators into larger transformation expressions. We also present an evaluation strategy to execute the modeled transformation, and thereby transform the input schema and data into the target schema and data assuming that data model wrappers are provided for each data model. The proposed framework has been implemented, and we give an overview of this prototype system.", "authors": ["Kajal T. Claypool", "Elke A.

{"abstract": "Wireless and satellite networks often have non-negligible packet corruption rates that can significantly degrade TCP performance. This is due to TCP's assumption that every packet loss is an indication of network congestion (causing TCP to reduce the transmission rate). This problem has received much attention in the literature. In this paper, we take a broad look at the problem of enhancing TCP performance under corruption losses, and include a discussion of the key issues. The main contributions of this paper are: (i) a confirmation of previous studies that show the reduction of TCP performance in the face of corruption loss, and in addition a plausible upper bound achievable with perfect knowledge of the cause of loss, (ii) a classification of the potential mitigation space, and (iii) the introduction of a promising new mitigation that employs rich cumulative information from intermediate nodes in a path to form a better congestion response.We first illustrate the performance implications of corruption-based loss for a variety of networks via simulation. In addition, we show a rough upper bound on the performance gains a TCP could get if it could perfectly determine the cause of each segment loss--independent of any specific mechanism for TCP to learn the root cause of packet loss. Next, we provide a taxonomy of potential practical classes of mitigations that TCP end-points and intermediate network elements can cooperatively use to decrease the performance impact of corruption-based loss. Finally, we briefly consider a potential mitigation, called cumulative explicit transport error notification (CETEN), which covers a portion of the solution space previously unexplored. CETEN is shown to be a promising mitigation strategy, but a strategy with numerous formidable practical hurdles still to overcome.", "authors": ["Rajesh Krishnan", "James P. G. Sterbenz", "Wesley M.

The first genetic programming variant is weighting data records for calculating the classification error and modifying the weights during the run. Hereby the algorithm is defining its own fitness function in an on-line fashion giving higher weights to 'hard' records. Another novel feature we study is the atomic representation, where `Booleanization' of data is not performed at the root, but at the leafs of the trees and only Boolean functions are used in the trees' body.

{"abstract": "Dynamic capacity provisioning is a useful technique for handling the multi-time-scale variations seen in Internet workloads. In this article, we propose a novel dynamic provisioning technique for multi-tier Internet applications that employs (1) a flexible queuing model to determine how much of the resources to allocate to each tier of the application, and (2) a combination of predictive and reactive methods that determine when to provision these resources, both at large and small time scales. We propose a novel data center architecture based on virtual machine monitors to reduce provisioning overheads. Our experiments on a forty-machine Xen/Linux-based hosting platform demonstrate the responsiveness of our technique in handling dynamic workloads. In one scenario where a flash crowd caused the workload of a three-tier application to double, our technique was able to double the application capacity within five minutes, thus maintaining response-time targets. Our technique also reduced the overhead of switching servers across applications from several minutes to less than a second, while meeting the performance targets of residual sessions.", "authors": ["Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Prashant J.

Discovering associations between items in a large database is one such data mining activity. In finding associations, support is used as an indicator as to whether an association is interesting. In this paper, we discuss three alternative interest measures for associations: any-confidence, all-confidence, and bond. We prove that the important downward closure property applies to both all-confidence and bond. We show that downward closure does not hold for any-confidence. We also prove that, if associations have a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond, then those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum support and the rules produced from those associations will have a given lower bound on their minimum confidence as well. However, associations that have that minimum support (and likewise their rules that have minimum confidence) may not satisfy the minimum all-confidence or minimum bond constraint. We describe the algorithms that efficiently find all associations with a minimum all-confidence or minimum bond and present some experimental results.", "authors": ["Edward Omiecinski"], "n_citation": 466, "references": ["0303c6e1-c932-4837-bd04-6e65ced69cb0", "1232fee4-0fa0-481b-aba7-9e204e9138a7", "19a221c9-6349-444b-8599-aea3a4c6e633", "2242e79e-04eb-43b8-8218-744cf73a37df", "24188611-1420-4eb7-8ca3-3466ef9b7f0a", "326fc9e5-9d69-4b89-ae23-987c90bd0f89", "34b7e270-80d7-46d5-a6f1-e50087a8d045", "46f6963a-2459-4e2c-8667-a8d0fcde43e9", "51a2a139-ff14-4e03-9ee7-4a3806385a31", "6487b9d5-8289-4383-8ac3-fc6a7e0f1324", "7a71e7df-2886-4884-83f0-810618e5dd0b", "82c534c6-c89d-4856-b6fc-e1cad5be4482", "8a6a4c08-fdc8-49c4-8e73-23e7fdb466d6", "9054b15d-a1d5-4326-93a1-01d759993e56", "99d9d092-40a9-4a69-bc24-e544ba77b3a2", "c4710c73-497d-44f0-ae10-64613eca18d4", "c49e6979-a8e3-4d37-b515-b2a5400e9522", "c99baeec-d70e-4cc0-aa54-cf39fb18cf9b", "cd2aad6d-33dc-40bd-a79e-b4c2cf4b4e17", "d95db242-72e8-4bef-a9fc-8c47b6e73754", "e75d8e62-a86d-4241-953f-1b315005d920", "e8ab235f-d709-4d84-87d4-c2dba5b73d32", "ecd6a845-8439-49b0-abe8-f71fff81da23", "fbdedd40-b9f0-4d4f-9c44-a4f592d11342", "fecef8e6-3a71-4101-9df7-498287c49eb7", "ff9e63a5-c40a-4113-958c-0a86033ac430"], "title": "Alternative interest measures for mining associations in databases", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": 2003, "id": "101bc171-1661-486a-9ba2-11afe756528c"}

{"abstract": "Today, orchestration of composite services is typically carried out by dedicated central engines. A central engine, however, can easily become a performance bottleneck. Furthermore, centralized orchestration is infeasible for the composite of services beyond enterprise boundaries. Decentralized orchestration approaches are therefore devised to overcome these drawbacks. Decentralized orchestration, however, is generally regarded as more complex for certain orchestration management tasks due to absence of centralized states. Among the challenging tasks are fault handling and recovery.

{"abstract": "This paper studies weak proximity drawings of graphs and demonstrates their advantages over strong proximity drawings in certain cases. Weak proximity drawings are straight line drawings such that if the proximity region of two points p and q \u00a0 representing vertices is devoid of other points representing vertices, then segment (p,q)(p,q) is allowed, but not forced, to appear in the drawing. This differs from the usual, strong, notion of proximity drawing in which such segments must appear in the drawing.#R##N##R##N#Most previously studied proximity regions are associated with a parameter \u03b2 \u00a0, 0\u2a7d\u03b2\u2a7d\u221e0\u2a7d\u03b2\u2a7d\u221e. For fixed \u03b2, weak \u03b2-drawability is at least as expressive as strong \u03b2-drawability, as a strong \u03b2-drawing is also a weak one. We give examples of graph families and \u03b2 values where the two notions coincide, and a situation in which it is NP-hard to determine weak \u03b2-drawability. On the other hand, we give situations where weak proximity significantly increases the expressive power of \u03b2-drawability: we show that every graph has, for all sufficiently small \u03b2, a weak \u03b2-proximity drawing that is computable in linear time, and we show that every tree has, for every \u03b2 less than 2, a weak \u03b2-drawing that is computable in linear time.", "authors": ["Giuseppe Di Battista", "Giuseppe Liotta", "Sue Whitesides"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["10266ea6-f35e-402a-b440-e954fc317f45", "17ef7dac-e01d-4d4f-8150-64fc66a2e882", "226349e4-7b0f-4d43-b155-f85e30441b59", "22edaeae-5899-46cd-86b2-736378ba69b8", "22fad823-1800-4713-a2a0-3c2582857bb3", "310849d3-2280-475e-9e57-8b19599085aa", "501f5230-c31e-48bd-9215-88da20db0907", "a8d45486-560e-477b-af46-476b3e22ff4d", "c0f70bdc-d9ae-401a-b21b-9afd48655f5d", "cd256750-7b6b-499b-971c-faed5f8ed3d3", "ce0ea27e-0190-4450-8806-404fa582274e", "d4bd4c2d-60d3-44b9-afef-f48938d0df50", "eb7ff8e6-5481-487b-8e1b-09e01a9b01d1"], "title": "The strength of weak proximity", "venue": "Journal of Discrete Algorithms", "year": 2006, "id": "f59a1b9c-59a4-40df-95d7-9ea2dd39db91"}

{"abstract": "This paper concerns the asynchronously switched control problem for a class of switched linear systems with average dwell time (ADT) in both continuous-time and discrete-time contexts. The so-called asynchronous switching means that the switchings between the candidate controllers and system modes are asynchronous. By further allowing the Lyapunov-like function to increase during the running time of active subsystems, the extended stability results for switched systems with ADT in nonlinear setting are first derived. Then, the asynchronously switched stabilizing control problem for linear cases is solved. Given the increase scale and the decrease scale of the Lyapunov-like function and the maximal delay of asynchronous switching, the minimal ADT for admissible switching signals and the corresponding controller gains are obtained. A numerical example is given to show the validity and potential of the developed results.", "authors": ["Lixian Zhang", "Huijun Gao"], "n_citation": 459, "references": ["1384b135-1a2b-4af4-bf56-b9e040727df3", "22f41b0f-eb9a-4412-8ea5-b459ab80578b", "3ca82f03-fc8c-432e-9aac-56f04609562c", "3ffc1845-eca6-4d14-8f3d-25b21c8e4edb", "45518bf3-e6ee-4ea9-96bb-08b3a5e597f1", "485a8485-2e88-4e49-8dff-cdcec121fec6", "7a2df906-8479-4d18-bbe8-aa7c1dc19336", "7aefdb89-17c9-4d16-96ee-5eb44e82cf81", "93135584-ab8f-4f79-b842-063b6589cbaa", "e9e60556-ed1a-485b-b2c4-81978acf893e"], "title": "Technical communique: Asynchronously switched control of switched linear systems with average dwell time", "venue": "Automatica", "year": 2010, "id": "c0fa193e-27a3-4bb4-91d1-eb2b4553b027"}
{"abstract": "We consider the problem of comparison between unordered trees, i.e., trees for which the order among siblings is unimportant. The criterion for comparison is the distance as measured by a weighted sum of the costs of deletion, insertion and relabel operations on tree nodes. Such comparisons may contribute to pattern recognition efforts in any field (e.g., genetics) where data can naturally be characterized by unordered trees. In companion work, we have shown this problem to be NP-complete. This paper presents an efficient enumerative algorithm and several heuristics leading to approximate solutions. The algorithms are based on probabilistic hill climbing and bipartite matching techniques. The paper evaluates the accuracy and time efficiency of the heuristics by applying them to a set of trees transformed from industrial parts based on a previously proposed morphological model. >", "authors": ["Dennis E.

{"abstract": "LEO is a comprehensive way to repair incorrect statistics and cardinality estimates of a query execution plan. LEO introduces a feedback loop to query optimization that enhances the available information on the database where the most queries have occurred, allowing the optimizer to actually learn from its past mistakes. We demonstrate how LEO learns outdated table access statistics on a TPC-H like database schema and show that LEO improves the estimates for table cardinalities as well as filter factors for single predicates. Thus LEO enables the query optimizer to choose a better query execution plan, resulting in more efficient query processing. We not only demonstrate learning by repetitive execution of a single query, but also illustrate how similar, but not identical queries benefit from learned knowledge. In addition, we show the effect of both learning cardinalities and adjusting related statistics.", "authors": ["Volker Markl", "Guy M.

{"abstract": "Advances in hardware-related technologies promise to enable new data management applications that monitor continuous processes. In these applications, enormous amounts of state samples are obtained via sensors and are streamed to a database. Further, updates are very frequent and may exhibit locality. While the R-tree is the index of choice for multi-dimensional data with low dimensionality, and is thus relevant to these applications, R-tree updates are also relatively inefficient. We present a bottom-up update strategy for R-trees that generalizes existing update techniques and aims to improve update performance. It has different levels of reorganization--ranging from global to local--during updates, avoiding expensive top-down updates. A compact main-memory summary structure that allows direct access to the R-tree index nodes is used together with efficient bottom-up algorithms. Empirical studies indicate that the bottom-up strategy outperforms the traditional top-down technique, leads to indices with better query performance, achieves higher throughput, and is scalable.", "authors": ["Mong Li Lee", "Wynne Hsu", "Christian S.

{"abstract": "Cellular automata can be applied to modelling the dynamics of spatially extended physical systems, and represent an alternative to the classical PDE approach. In this paper a macroscopic cellular automata model for simulating the bioremediation of contaminated soils is introduced. The choice of macroscopic automata is motivated by the aim to simulate large-scale systems. It is suggested that in some cases, where the basic laws of continuum mechanics cannot be directly applied without adding phenomenological assumptions, and where the equation system is not amenable to analytical solution, direct discrete modelling may represent a convenient alternative to the use of continuum models, followed by numerical discretization. This hypothesis is empirically tested in the bioremediation case. The model describes the bioremediation of contaminated soils, which relies upon the use of indigeneous microorganisms to degrade the contaminant: bioremediation models pose particular challenges as several physical, chemical and biological phenomena interact in a disordered and partially unknown matrix (the soil). The model is hierarchical, and is composed by a fluid dynamical layer, a solute description layer and a biological layer. The model has been tested in a pilot plant, in the case of contamination by phenol. The values of the phenomenological parameters have been determined by the use of genetic algorithms. The model has proven capable to carefully describe experimental results in a wide range of experimental conditions. It has also been run on a MIMD parallel architecture, achieving a high speed-up. It therefore represents an example of application of cellular automata to a real-world problem which has a very high social and economic importance, and where progresses in modelling may greatly improve the effectiveness of the decontamination interventions.", "authors": ["S.

{"abstract": "Higher hardware utilization and SLA fulfillment are two main objectives of any infrastructure cloud, thus, making resource allocation to virtual machines as one of the most critical aspect. Haizea is a popular cloud lease manager which supports a variety of resource leases according to the application requirements. These leases are: Immediate, Best-Effort, Deadline Sensitive and Advance Reservation (AR). But all these leases are static in nature viz. once resources are allocated to a lease, these resources cannot be altered during the complete lifetime of the lease. This contradicts with the philosophy and implementation of a pure on-demand elastic cloud where resources of a lease are continuously monitored against the utilization and altered based on the requirements. Our work aims at the inclusion of three important features to mitigate this shortcoming in Haizea. First, it introduces a new class of lease: Dynamic lease to accommodate resource changes. Second, it examines virtual machine resource utilization to decide about the demand and need of allocation change and third, it accommodates the expected changes in resource allocation by introducing two new sub-leases which allow dynamic resource allocation in the schedule. Lease experiments are performed on Haizea to validate the introduced features.", "authors": ["Pratick Chokhani", "Gaurav Somani"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["22118097-47bb-4f36-8e8f-32beeea87f66", "42c56aa8-0d48-4b76-9e94-12a951849a95", "73efde63-c75a-41fd-9b93-2efa1dff2079", "84482772-50e3-4a41-96ca-631eca3a7e6b", "a857060c-c25a-4ebf-bd65-597c54452a9f", "acc00fea-bff2-414a-8106-e0d21723c166", "b25773c3-7488-4bd1-ada6-fcb0f7303c09", "b3ceb858-b800-4a92-8eb4-3e9fd1bbc446", "cd186f2b-ef1f-4bb3-936e-9c6f5e8592c9", "f6b232b2-f7a4-4b5c-b622-b812c6157402"], "title": "Dynamic resource allocation using auto-negotiation in Haizea", "venue": "international conference on contemporary computing", "year": 2013, "id": "ddb074fe-8c99-465c-aa2a-0a20e43403f8"}

To extend transport layer functionality, the Internet Engineering Task Force approved the stream control transmission protocol (SCTP) as a proposed standard in October 2000. SUP was spawned from an effort started in the IETF Signaling Transport (Sigtrans) working group to develop a specialized transport protocol for call control signaling in voice-overt (VoIP) networks.

{"abstract": "Document properties are a compelling infrastructure on which to develop document management applications. A property-based approach avoids many of the problems of traditional heierarchical storage mechanisms, reflects document organizations meaningful to user tasks, provides a means to integrate the perspectives of multiple individuals and groups, and does this all within a uniform interaction framework. Document properties can reflect not only categorizations of documents and document use, but also expressions of desired system activity, such as sharing criteria, replication management, and versioning. Augmenting property-based document management systems with active properties that carry executable code enables the provision of document-based services on a property infrastructure.   The combination of document properties as a uniform mechanism for document management, and active properties as a way of delivering document services, represents a new paradigm for document management infrastructures. The Placeless Documents system is an experimental prototype developed to explore this new paradigm. It is based on the seamless integration of user-specific, active properties. We present the fundamental design approach, explore the challenges and opportunities it presents, and show our architectures deals with them.", "authors": ["Paul Dourish", "W.

{"abstract": "Many cellular channel assignment policies have been proposed to improve efficiency beyond that resulting from fixed channel allocation. The performance of these policies, however, has rarely been compared due to a lack of formal metrics, particularly under nonhomogeneous call distributions. In this paper, we introduce two such metrics: the worst-case number of channels required to accommodate all possible configurations of N calls in a cell cluster, and the set of cell states that can be accommodated with M channels. We first measure two extreme policies, fixed channel allocation and maximum packing, under these metrics. We then prove a new lower bound, under the first metric, on any channel assignment policy. Next, we introduce three intermediate channel assignment policies, based on commonly used ideas of channel ordering, hybrid assignment, and partitioning. Finally, these policies are used to demonstrate the tradeoff between the performance and the complexity of a channel allocation policy.", "authors": ["Scott Jordan", "Eric J.

{"abstract": "The Open Agent Architecture (OAA), developed and used for several years at SRI International, makes it possible for software services to be provided through the cooperative efforts of distributed collections of autonomous agents. Communication and cooperation between agents are brokered by one or more facilitators, which are responsible for matching requests, from users and agents, with descriptions of the capabilities of other agents. Thus it is not generally required that a user or agent know the identities, locations, or number of other agents involved in satisfying a request. OAA is structured so as to minimize the effort involved in creating new agents and \"wrapping\" legacy applications, written in various languages and operating on various platforms; to encourage the reuse of existing agents; and to allow for dynamism and flexibility in the makeup ofagent communities.

{"abstract": "Context: Complex software-intensive systems comprise many subsystems that are often based on heterogeneous technological platforms and managed by different organizational units. Multi product lines (MPLs) are an emerging area of research addressing variability management for such large-scale or ultra-large-scale systems. Despite the increasing number of publications addressing MPLs the research area is still quite fragmented. Objective: The aims of this paper are thus to identify, describe, and classify existing approaches supporting MPLs and to increase the understanding of the underlying research issues. Furthermore, the paper aims at defining success-critical capabilities of infrastructures supporting MPLs. Method: Using a systematic literature review we identify and analyze existing approaches and research issues regarding MPLs. Approaches described in the literature support capabilities needed to define and operate MPLs. We derive capabilities supporting MPLs from the results of the systematic literature review. We validate and refine these capabilities based on a survey among experts from academia and industry. Results: The paper discusses key research issues in MPLs and presents basic and advanced capabilities supporting MPLs. We also show examples from research approaches that demonstrate how these capabilities can be realized. Conclusions: We conclude that approaches supporting MPLs need to consider both technical aspects like structuring large models and defining dependencies between product lines as well as organizational aspects such as distributed modeling and product derivation by multiple stakeholders. The identified capabilities can help to build, enhance, and evaluate MPL approaches.", "authors": ["Gerald Holl", "Paul Gr\u00fcnbacher", "Rick Rabiser"], "n_citation": 58, "references": ["01d431db-ab3b-47b7-b7ce-06f58ae99837", "02ce6911-5881-4439-80ff-ca13035c377c", "0b8fa924-acb9-4033-8d14-7f051c0fe5b1", "0ea98fca-2104-4498-a7d5-757de243ea84", "10e0904d-b8ed-467d-96c9-a6295f35c90f", "1154b436-a9ae-4f9b-8fb6-4e84eddc9d15", "237c2c3b-f1d0-47af-b4ad-61faeec2c034", "25ee1fe9-2bb6-4b96-aeec-09fd60aaf710", "2696c685-2e26-4c4a-9b39-8cf1c032bb1f", "26b4363f-3015-467a-86b8-b56d02d0c022", "28e5238f-52ac-4de8-a238-709fb8653a97", "2ea16b73-aba1-4f7c-8f45-69ddf284c3f3", "2fa89208-874a-4fb9-9386-b6a366913fab", "33621a6e-4a79-43ef-8151-ba54de716008", "3a17fa73-0e2b-40d5-abe2-9d888240a79f", "3e1bb0e6-21c9-4604-908f-16346dac936a", "3e6731f9-3725-42f3-8c9f-19afd246beb3", "5774b886-eb01-4e01-a412-7958b604e440", "59bcfee7-3e4f-4a58-a4ab-ab693588c6aa", "6137c294-579c-4a1f-b808-a451ca1d0444", "639d2eb1-8652-4e23-b490-725c6058ab1b", "72b6ac59-b142-4eb3-8b45-0bc137606ca0", "7302c3b3-4a92-4803-b45b-dbeed7d1cc18", "730f2812-48ba-47ce-a85a-be2518c927a4", "778587d3-3a60-40f3-adc1-42862c27c624", "7f8d9581-286c-417f-ad52-010191c12d0b", "832d241a-72ab-42b7-97f3-e34e49c59af1", "8842db59-61ad-4398-937e-88954ecc609e", "92d7dc3a-f12d-4ef0-89fb-9f8a8e66de46", "9cec3086-a32a-4c4c-b103-3083fa610cbd", "9f084a1a-aae1-4c18-965c-09d1440cfec4", "b3390ea4-e26c-4ad7-9b6d-a1b40b2c2b72", "b3a7caa5-c6f1-439c-b8c0-5394087bfee5", "bb75daab-8f61-419d-8730-46d489a55c89", "bbb207d1-5756-4a63-8575-0f5e84fa0e6d", "bc3546dd-1d07-4e2f-a4f1-d4a66e10a7fd", "ca392089-1214-436e-bda5-1760e6af2226", "ce86b58c-7e61-4ff0-a08f-ddf992132932", "d8756d9c-7dde-4c11-a93d-9e6999b57eb0", "d8ff14c7-1a1b-433d-a27d-9bce2c5a8604", "dd836b0b-b14c-4b1c-a80d-421d3817b24a", "e5bcbc27-2466-45dd-81fc-f6970b954589", "eaa8bd27-b7f7-4bea-8a03-7deb3f2b967e", "edc0ca4d-bbed-4a24-a907-64d67c461251", "f63120fa-408b-42f8-99ef-d767c4e238b7", "fc3c191e-c6f7-4818-ad2e-d7a1639da149", "fd70f5d7-f649-4295-998f-20ade6610ba0"], "title": "A systematic review and an expert survey on capabilities supporting multi product lines", "venue": "Information & Software Technology", "year": 2012, "id": "d86ada5c-ea59-4692-bc34-67df93547b20"}

{"abstract": "Long-term therapy with antiretroviral (ARV) agents in HIV-infected patients often results in failure to suppress the viral load. Imperfect adherence and drug susceptibility to prescribed antiviral drugs are important factors explaining the resurgence of virus. A better understanding of the factors responsible for the virological failure is critical for the development of new treatment strategies. In this paper, we develop a mechanism-based reparameterized differential equation model for characterizing long-term viral dynamics with ARV therapy. In this model we directly incorporate drug susceptibility and drug adherence (measured by medication event monitoring system (MEMS) and questionnaires) into a function of treatment efficacy. A Bayesian nonlinear mixed-effects modeling approach is investigated for estimating dynamic parameters by fitting the model to viral load data from an AIDS clinical trial. The effects of drug adherence interaction with drug resistance-based models are compared using (i) the sum of the squared residual (SSR) from individual subjects and (ii) the deviance information criterion (DIC), a Bayesian version of the classical deviance for model assessment, designed from complex hierarchical model settings. The results indicate that the drug adherence combined with confounding factor, drug resistance in viral dynamic modeling significantly predict virologic responses. Our study suggests that long-term reparameterized dynamic models are powerful and effective in establishing a relationship of antiviral responses with drug adherence and susceptibility.", "authors": ["Yangxin Huang"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["9cd08b95-b048-4afb-a0fa-14536dd0b1d0"], "title": "Long-term HIV dynamic models incorporating drug adherence and resistance to treatment for prediction of virological responses", "venue": "Computational Statistics & Data Analysis", "year": 2008, "id": "269ba8e2-0a98-4892-8097-f85beff41746"}

We discuss the extensions needed to deal with XML data and XPath queries. A single peer can hold a whole document or a partial/complete fragment of the latter. Each XML fragment/document is identified by a distinct path expression, which is encoded in a distributed hash table. Our framework differs from content-based routing mechanisms, biased towards finding the most relevant peers holding the data. We perform fragments placement and enable fragments lookup by solely exploiting few path expressions stored on each peer. By taking advantage of quasi-zero replication of global catalogs, our system supports fast full and partial XPath querying.

{"abstract": "Sequences of events are an important special form of data that arises in several contexts, including telecommunications, user interface studies, and epidemiology. We present a general and flexible framework of specifying classes of generalized episodes. These are recurrent combinations of events satisfying certain conditions. The framework can be instantiated to a wide variety of applications by selecting suitable primitive conditions. We present algorithms for discovering frequently occurring episodes and episode rules. The algorithms are based on the use of minimal occurrences of episodes; this makes it possible to evaluate confidences of a wide variety of rules using only a single analysis pass.

{"abstract": "This paper presents the results of handwritten digit recognition on well-known image databases using state-of-the-art feature extraction and classification techniques. The tested databases are CENPARMI, CEDAR, and MNIST. On the test data set of each database, 80 recognition accuracies are given by combining eight classifiers with ten feature vectors. The features include chaincode feature, gradient feature, profile structure feature, and peripheral direction contributivity. The gradient feature is extracted from either binary image or gray-scale image. The classifiers include the k-nearest neighbor classifier, three neural classifiers, a learning vector quantization classifier, a discriminative learning quadratic discriminant function (DLQDF) classifier, and two support vector classifiers (SVCs). All the classifiers and feature vectors give high recognition accuracies. Relatively, the chaincode feature and the gradient feature show advantage over other features, and the profile structure feature shows efficiency as a complementary feature. The SVC with RBF kernel (SVC-rbf) gives the highest accuracy in most cases but is extremely expensive in storage and computation. Among the non-SV classifiers, the polynomial classifier and DLQDF give the highest accuracies. The results of non-SV classifiers are competitive to the best ones previously reported on the same databases.", "authors": ["Cheng-Lin Liu", "Kazuki Nakashima", "Hiroshi Sako", "Hiromichi Fujisawa"], "n_citation": 531, "references": ["042172f1-fe4c-463d-a017-e8edf64817cc", "051c4211-d641-4b90-bfec-633a636845a8", "0ed949f7-7118-45fa-8a4c-63fcf9f4bd8f", "13831b2d-6da0-4b64-add3-795121956d31", "146aac22-d446-44ec-9e85-ca24284d7371", "1ef607fe-5348-4658-8964-25a57fc49270", "33266c8a-9928-4cb4-97b5-836abaea1c12", "38e05dc2-205a-44cd-9822-4cd0dc6e2b96", "3a6e5548-7c05-4e89-83c3-d4463d2ac6bd", "46e35581-d416-438d-a13c-0c1959d89c4f", "4fa95ad7-531a-4695-b312-d76cd83d757a", "693a1be9-5e0a-4cf2-a4a5-6b64f90d78f3", "69e5215c-a851-4498-9617-27ab7fa70cef", "75235960-2f8a-453a-b8d4-bf55d282c817", "7b00f601-7483-4240-817d-047edc06d0f6", "7b57db11-7c4d-4d1e-aa62-3a5d7d1f7987", "91979159-37d8-410f-a245-a33ef80a092b", "94180d73-625d-4a74-9752-12b8a94e2e4a", "94a79856-6526-4dc6-b948-824cfbac0183", "96096b3d-4aba-419a-a1d5-c5921bc938a8", "b17797ae-53e4-4b79-b7d7-90a3729d6460", "b592576f-ff29-4a68-9b2f-8a8ad02e9c70", "bb08006d-9062-471e-b357-36ce7574b3bc", "c1e5cd4e-d1fa-454a-8edd-c5e2138dc5ed", "c23c4c74-f59a-4ed7-8600-f6100358d4bd", "d120a352-5f1e-4a64-b65a-85fda703f3be", "fb763eac-1e1e-423d-b65f-c9d69565dbff"], "title": "Handwritten digit recognition: benchmarking of state-of-the-art techniques", "venue": "Pattern Recognition", "year": 2003, "id": "772c5825-077d-4f3f-8927-ec5fa0fcb828"}
{"abstract": "Joint power control and beamforming schemes are proposed for cellular systems where adaptive arrays are used only at base stations. In the uplink, mobile power and receiver diversity combining vectors at the base stations are calculated jointly. The mobile transmitted power is minimized, while the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratio (SINR) at each link is maintained above a threshold. A transmit diversity scheme for the downlink is also proposed where the transmit weight vectors and downlink power allocations are jointly calculated such that the SINR at each mobile is above a target value. The proposed algorithm achieves a feasible solution for the downlink if there is one and minimizes the total transmitted power in the network. In a reciprocal network it can be implemented in a decentralized system, and it does not require global channel response measurements. In a nonreciprocal network, where the uplink and downlink channel responses are different, the proposed transmit beamforming algorithm needs to be implemented in a centralized system, and it requires a knowledge of the downlink channel responses.

{"abstract": "Abstract   The sceptical inference relation associated with a Poole system without constraints is known to have a simple semantic representation by means of a smooth order directly defined on the set of interpretations associated with the underlying language. Conversely, we prove in this paper that, on a finite prepositional language, any preferential inference relation defined by such a model is induced by a Poole system without constraints. In the particular case of rational relations, the associated set of defaults may be chosen to be minimal; it then consists of a set of formulae, totally ordered through classical implication, with cardinality equal to the height of the given relation. This result can be applied to knowledge representation theory and corresponds, in revision theory, to Grove's family of spheres. In the framework of conditional knowledge bases and default extensions, it implies that any rational inference relation may be considered as the rational closure of a minimal knowledge base. An immediate consequence of this is the possibility of replacing any conditional knowledge base by a minimal one that provides the same amount of information.", "authors": ["Michael Freund"], "n_citation": 24, "references": ["364fe74c-ce06-45b2-a374-2a48c3d40e58", "39a38f11-42bd-4498-85d6-868d5e9c6850", "4cf0f332-ce09-47fb-8aee-b021fe192db8", "6dcf9f47-7a83-40b6-890b-9f6bc8585986", "79f6e265-382f-4427-ab33-a201b74ec81c", "b3a6f742-8207-4274-b7d6-cdbefa3e8938", "b7aa04da-08ef-4e63-958a-6d9246a655e4", "cc47ab23-4478-4b25-a3b9-cd6a82cf0bef", "e210c134-962d-4aa3-a89b-14971e2f5400", "f15553ca-cbcd-4504-8aae-f657bcaf4fd2"], "title": "Preferential reasoning in the perspective of Poole default logic", "venue": "Artificial Intelligence", "year": 1998, "id": "81f62ad9-70dd-4595-bf9e-4d90faf5533b"}

A key point of our approach is that this mapping does not have to be univalent, so that a vertex in a graph may be associated with several vertices of the other graph. Another key point is that the quality of the mapping is determined by generic functions, which can be tuned in order to implement domain-dependant knowledge.

{"abstract": "Clouds are emerging as an important class of distributed computational resources and are quickly becoming an integral part of production computational infrastructures. An important but oft-neglected question is, what new applications and application capabilities can be supported by clouds as part of a hybrid computational platform? In this paper we use the ensemble Kalman-filter based dynamic application workflow and investigate how clouds can be effectively used as an accelerator to address changing computational requirements as well as changing Quality of Service constraints (e.g., deadlines). Furthermore, we explore how application and system-level adaptivity can be used to improve application performance and achieve a more effective utilization of the hybrid platform. Specifically, we adapt the ensemble Kalman-filter based application formulation (serial versus parallel, different solvers etc.) so as to execute efficiently on a range of different infrastructure (from High Performance Computing grids to clouds that support single core and many-core virtual machines). Our results show that there are performance advantages to be had by supporting application and infrastructure level adaptivity. In general, we find that grid-cloud infrastructure can support novel usage modes, such as deadline-driven scheduling, for applications with tunable characteristics that can adapt to varying resource types.", "authors": ["Hyunjoo Kim", "Yaakoub El-Khamra", "Shantenu Jha", "Manish Parashar"], "n_citation": 30, "references": ["03ea940d-dba9-40e6-b734-8b08e34021cf", "15778a8c-2361-49fa-b073-c5aae4516d99", "2f19a945-40a7-49d4-b9ae-30a2e2df9903", "33393cb8-0623-4735-ad5b-02f8cc7151f2", "4730cf22-f153-43e3-bf74-cbb71f426e32", "4c36f482-1f7d-4a6c-a6f9-2e0a5b7056a4", "52aa08bc-4589-4d6f-a51d-ab596a173daa", "5c03a5f2-f936-48c3-a94e-2134e2e737a7", "767b2d09-96ce-4d47-bd06-f3e3c15c9651", "9cdc54f0-f1a0-4422-ac16-d9164d9371ee", "ba5894c1-78f3-4953-9f01-5294d990acbb", "cde64ce3-ee1a-4653-948a-d86312be2c99", "cf1df8a0-5e05-4434-b399-8d675a25f2b8", "e54dd975-fd02-4e21-afc2-bf76d24e99a3", "f320820a-587c-4bfb-8328-ef945af1dd60", "f5cdf232-159a-455a-af90-c84831cbb810"], "title": "Exploring application and infrastructure adaptation on hybrid grid-cloud infrastructure", "venue": "high performance distributed computing", "year": 2010, "id": "672be37f-7ae9-4496-b9ad-715331ed65ce"}

In fact, depth perception is one of the most important subjects in computer vision. Stereovision is an attractive and widely used method, but, it is rather limited to make 3D surface maps, due to the correspondence problem. The correspondence problem can be improved using a method based on structured light concept, projecting a given pattern on the measuring surfaces. However, some relations between the projected pattern and the reflected one must be solved. This relationship can be directly found codifying the projected light, so that, each imaged region of the projected pattern carries the needed information to solve the correspondence problem.", "authors": ["Joan Batlle", "El Mustapha Mouaddib", "Joaquim Salvi"], "n_citation": 554, "references": ["02ec35cb-b0a1-49f1-a87e-946be9eb7aa6", "144e305d-2552-4a79-a1f1-91be1bf34151", "21ee7407-6407-4ead-8929-876df1e21dba", "2d79357d-a188-4774-83be-9bad3f6f580e", "307feaf0-4c60-4eaa-8629-c8f2340f41a8", "3314e154-01d9-40b0-8c90-9d6d043154ec", "48d01929-2170-4edf-a8db-c948cb33d72d", "527c0292-894b-4d20-b12d-82dd51d4c143", "54958788-ddd4-41b0-be8b-7d215b2c9815", "58a7ad05-5ed0-4a75-a2a5-62c4d94bfa97", "6775ce2b-db8f-4bc1-9bae-8d444ce5ecee", "68fc5986-175c-4f60-a39b-91d54973e0d1", "6aebbcd0-624c-477c-a6f0-c2f3ebc549f9", "6d4fdbb8-ae11-4fab-9da2-f8631f71170a", "73047f1f-1acf-4f2a-86d1-98b5dd57fa4f", "755c9ea5-0e65-4865-a5ca-d7148153594f", "776d131c-9163-477e-a61f-cffe29aad721", "79b00807-adb2-46ad-b019-b3bb9902533d", "7bb8eb4a-bb3f-47b0-86bf-811f80041233", "7c5f892e-c8a0-4623-a8a3-5175ab438ca4", "81251c93-acf8-4031-8acc-4b570c5759cc", "82478cab-00f3-4d64-9120-57d0d5e21715", "888acabf-83b0-4d45-835e-317862049801", "8c0bdf2e-74bd-46c6-ae3d-784f37594c7f", "944c75de-28c2-4ecd-8a59-ae65f42573b9", "988e51d5-75de-4102-8659-b2d9a87db947", "995d40e0-dfcf-4c53-b70e-9c5b4a6fd68b", "9ec83b3d-7cf6-415e-9591-ef5c30baae46", "9f91c3c3-2b1a-470a-bcdf-c5c26d7d7f0b", "9fc98931-7ade-41eb-aa86-a2b8072ff49c", "a54d0b46-d7ba-4036-abd2-d30c95130f35", "b03710a7-0fe2-475c-9335-9ac1dfb1a15e", "b9e764c2-73ca-4df6-a8cd-228317bf928b", "d5b730c4-7c2f-4071-b267-1c56d82a5bbd", "f39486db-a4d9-49b4-a659-44c63900a7d5", "fc95549e-7237-4ca0-8c96-924add128901"], "title": "RECENT PROGRESS IN CODED STRUCTURED LIGHT AS A TECHNIQUE TO SOLVE THE CORRESPONDENCE PROBLEM: A SURVEY", "venue": "Pattern Recognition", "year": 1998, "id": "7e119298-7b58-46c9-9e07-0a4b07085c51"}
{"abstract": "Algebraic Theory of Processes provides the first general and systematic introduction to the semantics of concurrent systems, a relatively new research area in computer science. It develops the mathematical foundations of the algebraic approach to the formal semantics of languages and applies these ideas to a particular semantic theory of distributed processes. The book is unique in developing three complementary views of the semantics of concurrent processes: a behavioral view where processes are deemed to be equivalent if they cannot be distinguished by any experiment; a denotational model where processes are interpreted as certain kinds of trees; and a proof-theoretic view where processes may be transformed into equivalent processes using valid equations or transformations. It is an excellent guide on how to reason about and relate behavioral, denotational, and proof-theoretical aspects of languages in general: all three views are developed for a sequence of increasingly complex algebraic languages for concurrency and in each case they are shown to be equivalent. Algebraic Theory of Processes is a valuable source of information for theoretical computer scientists, not only as an elegant and comprehensive introduction to the field but also in its discussion of the author's own theory of the behavioral semantics of processes (\"testing equivalence\") and original results in example languages for distributed processes, It is self-contained; the problems addressed are motivated from the standpoint of computer science, and all the required algebraic concepts are covered.

{"abstract": "Most Java-based systems that support portable parallel and distributed computing either require the programmer to deal with intricate low-level details of Java which can be a tedious, time-consuming and error-prone task, or prevent the programmer from controlling locality of data. In this paper we describe JavaSymphony, a programming paradigm for distributed and parallel computing that provides a software infrastructure for wide classes of heterogeneous systems ranging from small-scale cluster computing to large scale wide-area meta-computing. The software infrastructure is written entirely in Java and runs on any standard compliant Java virtual machine. In contrast to most existing systems, JavaSymphony provides the programmer with the flexibility to control data locality and load balancing by explicit mapping of objects to computing nodes. Virtual architectures are specified to impose a virtual hierarchy on a distributed system of physical computing nodes. Objects can be mapped and dynamically migrated to arbitrary components of virtual architectures. A high-level API to hardware/software system parameters is provided to control mapping, migration, and load balancing of objects. Objects can interact through synchronous asynchronous and one-sided method invocation. Selective remote class loading may reduce the overall memory requirement of an application. Moreover; objects can be made persistent by explicitly storing and loading objects to/from external storage. A prototype of the JavaSymphony software infrastructure has been implemented. Preliminary experiments on a heterogeneous cluster of workstations are described that demonstrate reasonable performance values.", "authors": ["Thomas Fahringer"], "n_citation": 48, "references": ["29fb4215-67a2-4edc-9f50-8fdf144480c1", "302afa84-817d-409d-86d6-5a835840da29", "36c05ec1-7f89-44d4-a180-49820c36e4a0", "38d01c27-c3d1-47e3-a657-c8c08ca505aa", "3afb6b36-2e35-4fc5-9705-fc3ce8742709", "52fe633e-1582-4469-a060-772e11825a36", "5c7e3099-b047-4152-bb6d-de884f94cafc", "72f01f3d-df21-4e9e-9294-a641409d1c2d", "7785cef3-d29d-4c0b-b975-d670270f09fb", "792b33b5-d338-4928-bcf0-d556c8ad639b", "7c3fe6ff-c49d-423b-b4b5-85bc94085ffd", "9216df4b-e768-4845-a6ec-98e4d72c8c85", "a56d5279-c1d1-44d3-ad30-18ef519c6c88", "c799623d-1413-47ae-9805-a7328a494165", "cb6d0d02-942b-4119-a0c4-a2a7e0e27630", "d06572a2-5335-47c6-ba44-cbd6e65a9a91"], "title": "JavaSymphony: a system for development of locality-oriented distributed and parallel Java applications", "venue": "international conference on cluster computing", "year": 2000, "id": "4d2b5e11-c9fb-4f31-a912-858418a02cb7"}
{"abstract": "This article presents an improved method for semiautomatic bug localization, by extending our previous generalized algorithm debugging technique, (GADT) [Fritzson et al. 1991], which uses declarative assertions about program units such as procedures and operational assertions about program behavior. For example, functional properties are best expressed through declarative assertions about procedure units, whereas order-dependent properties, or sequencing constraints in general, are more easily expressed using operational semantics. A powerful assertion language, called FORMAN, has been developed to this end. Such assertions can be collected into assertion libraries, which can greatly increase the degree of automation in bug localization. The long-range goal of this work is a semiautomatic debugging and testing system, which can be used during large-scale program development of nontrivial programs. To our knowledge, the extended GADT (EGADT) presented here is the first method that uses powerful operational assertions integrated with algorithmic debugging. In addition to providing support for local-level bug localization within procedures (which is not handled well by basic algorithmic debugging), the operational assertions reduce the number of irrelevant questions to the programmer during bug localization, thus further improving bug localization. A prototype of the GADT, implemented in PASCAL, supports debugging in a subset of Pascal. An interpreter of FORMAN assertions has also been implemented in PASCAL. During bug localization, both declarative and operational assertions are evaluated on execution traces.", "authors": ["Peter Fritzson", "Mikhail Auguston", "Nahid Shahmehri"], "n_citation": 36, "references": ["060541a1-e5e9-41d8-8e68-7e8f73cb3d1d", "08de31d5-74cd-4196-b2e4-3a089ed2968a", "1e9d3d4c-3bbd-4475-b95d-168159c51d23", "2c08d317-3848-40af-9dfa-20c8ce584ce9", "5a06864e-34c8-4c65-88f9-051ad8186d9b", "80742627-4b91-4525-beb7-97255ff4a3b0", "8152327d-ebc8-43a7-86c1-7ce8157ba787", "8bfd8def-3c14-4168-964f-177c9bb0b99c", "a281e196-55f8-4d90-a5b9-93351e86d054", "a4e37dfc-22d4-4afa-b792-6de9ad54c89f", "cd9fc756-ad30-4caa-8879-0ff01bd549e9"], "title": "Using assertions in declarative and operational models for automated debugging", "venue": "Journal of Systems and Software", "year": 1994, "id": "54af53f2-9e3e-4dc8-b91b-5c9a9fcece9b"}

{"abstract": "More than 200 papers, two special issues (Journal of Circuits, Systems, and Computers, March, June, 1993, and IEEE Trans. on Circuits and Systems, vol. 40, no. 10, October, 1993), an International Workshop on Chua\u2019s Circuit: chaotic phenomena and applica tions at NOLTA\u201993, and a book (edited by R.N. Madan, World Scientific, 1993) on Chua\u2019s circuit have been published since its inception a decade ago. This review paper attempts to present an overview of these timely publications, almost all within the last six months, and to identify four milestones of this very active research area. An important milestone is the recent fabrication of a monolithic Chua\u2019s circuit. The robustness of this IC chip demonstrates that an array of Chua\u2019s circuits can also be fabricated into a monolithic chip, thereby opening the floodgate to many unconventional applications in information technology, synergetics, and even music. The second milestone is the recent global unfolding of Chua\u2019s circuit, obtained by adding a linear resistor in series with the inductor to obtain a canonical Chua\u2019s circuit\u2014 now generally referred to as Chua\u2019s oscillator. This circuit is most significant because it is structurally the simplest (it contains only 6 circuit elements) but dynamically the most complex among all nonlinear circuits and systems described by a 21-parameter family of continuous odd-symmetric piecewise-linear vector fields. The third milestone is the recent discovery of several important new phenomena in Chua\u2019s circuits, e.g., stochastic resonance, chaos-chaos type intermittency, 1/f noise spectrum, etc. These new phenomena could have far-reaching theoretical and practical significance. The fourth milestone is the theoretical and experimental demonstration that Chua\u2019s circuit can be easily controlled from a chaotic regime to a prescribed periodic or constant orbit, or it can be synchronized with 2 or more identical Chua\u2019s circuits, operating in an oscillatory, or a chaotic regime. These recent breakthroughs have ushered in a new era where chaos is deliberately created and exploited for unconventional applications, e.g. secure communication.", "authors": ["Leon O.

{"abstract": "Although detractors of functional programming sometimes claim that functional programming is too difficult or counter-intuitive for most programmers to understand and use, evidence to the contrary can be found by looking at the popularity of spreadsheets. The spreadsheet paradigm, a first-order subset of the functional programming paradigm, has found wide acceptance among both programmers and end users. Still, there are many limitations with most spreadsheet systems. In this paper, we discuss language features that eliminate several of these limitations without deviating from the first-order, declarative evaluation model. The language used to illustrate these features is a research language called Forms&#002F;3. Using Forms&#002F;3, we show that procedural abstraction, data abstraction and graphics output can be supported in the spreadsheet paradigm. We show that, with the addition of a simple model of time, animated output and GUI I&#002F;O also become viable. To demonstrate generality, we also present an animated Turing machine simulator programmed using these features.

{"abstract": "Android platform adopts permissions to protect sensitive resources from untrusted apps. However, after permissions are granted by users at install time, apps could use these permissions (sensitive resources) with no further restrictions. Thus, recent years have witnessed the explosion of undesirable behaviors in Android apps. An important part in the defense is the accurate analysis of Android apps. However, traditional syscall-based analysis techniques are not well-suited for Android, because they could not capture critical interactions between the application and the Android system.   This paper presents VetDroid, a dynamic analysis platform for reconstructing sensitive behaviors in Android apps from a novel permission use perspective. VetDroid features a systematic framework to effectively construct permission use behaviors, i.e., how applications use permissions to access (sensitive) system resources, and how these acquired permission-sensitive resources are further utilized by the application. With permission use behaviors, security analysts can easily examine the internal sensitive behaviors of an app. Using real-world Android malware, we show that VetDroid can clearly reconstruct fine-grained malicious behaviors to ease malware analysis. We further apply VetDroid to 1,249 top free apps in Google Play. VetDroid can assist in finding more information leaks than TaintDroid, a state-of-the-art technique. In addition, we show how we can use VetDroid to analyze fine-grained causes of information leaks that TaintDroid cannot reveal. Finally, we show that VetDroid can help identify subtle vulnerabilities in some (top free) applications otherwise hard to detect.", "authors": ["Yuan Zhang", "Min Yang", "Bingquan Xu", "Zhemin Yang", "Guofei Gu", "Peng Ning", "X.

{"abstract": "A set of procedures for assigning codes to internal states of a synchronous sequential machine so as to minimize the internal logic in two-level form is proposed. The procedures are based on interpreting the state table of a sequential machine as a set of mappings from present states into next states, under control of the inputs. Attention is focused on a particular subset of these mappings, called pr mappings. A numerical score is assigned to each pr mapping, which is a measure of the desirability of ``selecting'' the mapping for inclusion in a ``basic set'' of mappings. A basic set has the property of determining a unique code assignment (within a symmetry of the cube of internal states). The procedures are applied to a 3-stage shift register and result in the optimum encoding for that device. Finally, it is briefly indicated how three previous assignment methods, including one developed by the author, are related to those described here. Algorithms are presented for some but not all of the proposed procedures. These algorithms must be completed before the proposals can be implemented by a computer program.", "authors": ["Douglas B.

{"abstract": "We have designed a Bluetooth-based body sensor network platform for physiological diary applications and have addressed its challenges in cost, energy efficiency, and user interface. In our platform, an Internet-capable phone serves as the center and manages every network member. We designed a Bluetooth sensor node for general sensing devices to join the network without much alteration.

It displays information under the instruction of the phone in an ambient fashion, and enables the user to interact with the network conveniently.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a formal definition for HMBS (Hypermedia Model Based on Statecharts). HMBS uses the structure and execution semantics of statecharts to specify both the structural organization and the browsing semantics of hypermedia applications. Statecharts are an extension of finite-state machines and the model is thus a generalization of hypergraph-based hypertext models. Some of the most important features of HMBS are its ability to model hierarchy and synchronization of information; provision of mechanisms for specifying access structures, navigational contexts, access control, multiple tailored versions,and hierarchical views. Analysis of the underlying statechart machine allows verification of page reachability, valid paths, and other properties, thus providing mechanisms to support authors in the development of structured applications.", "authors": ["Maria Cristina Ferreira de Oliveira", "Marcelo Augusto Santos Turine", "Paulo Cesar Masiero"], "n_citation": 105, "references": ["13ca496a-e8a1-4c1b-95c4-f3b3b6107a13", "18f12ed3-e7b8-4549-9e7a-0a745e34628e", "1c2833e0-2d8f-4051-b1a9-d3d756400de6", "2e92b518-c583-49e3-ab2e-c0dc1d925ca1", "434c6641-d180-4295-bc20-87ea8f71bd53", "5034ed41-1ce5-4666-92d9-3e0aa9ea2885", "51e97a65-ed7b-40a7-a5c1-be0034290a01", "558163ff-f5f3-41d8-9c03-2ef4d776bee3", "61b5c310-375e-4b75-8854-2746edce7936", "6a172302-7826-4490-b9c7-4993a0b948f6", "70d19e95-2818-4683-8f4e-8e324be5d245", "7202bdc0-e807-4613-af97-30362e9f5f8f", "882f7b63-74b9-4264-8bb8-ec8df56a5023", "9063024a-a258-49b7-8a17-248e0c5a37cf", "9df343f9-89ad-4aa1-bc2d-21235baa5035", "ad43bb36-a39a-4076-b862-0a015e63d06a", "c18b2bef-5eca-4afc-b3a5-2de6b4fcd113", "c6ded58c-139b-4acc-aecc-62f36e86f9c0", "cef7e531-6f03-4f32-8347-8bb23f1dffa4", "e026f95d-da0a-46e3-84d5-29b8afa307ab", "e77b003c-b9ad-48ed-b47c-9dc1199ab99d", "e7d2d7de-fe9f-4f05-a07f-4ecbe74ff03f", "fb913939-963e-42af-a66f-6c7d5e7b5661"], "title": "A statechart-based model for hypermedia applications", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Information Systems", "year": 2001, "id": "492573b8-e4ed-4ed3-899c-bde9b2ad26f6"}

{"abstract": "We consider adaptive shortest-path routing in wireless networks. In this problem, we aim to optimize the quality of communication between a source and a destination through adaptive path selection. Due to the randomness and uncertainties in the network dynamics, the state of each communication link varies over time according to a stochastic process with unknown distributions. The link states are not directly observable. The aggregated end-to-end cost of a path from the source to the destination is revealed after the path is chosen for communication. The objective is an adaptive path selection algorithm that minimizes regret defined as the additional cost over the ideal scenario where the best path is known a priori. This problem can be cast as a variation of the classic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem with each path as an arm and arms dependent through common links. We show that by exploiting arm dependencies, a regret polynomial with the network size can be achieved while maintaining the optimal logarithmic order with time. This is in sharp contrast with the exponential regret order with the network size offered by a direct application of the classic MAB policies that ignores arm dependencies. Furthermore, our results are obtained under a general model of link state distributions (including heavy-tailed distributions). These results find applications in cognitive radio and ad hoc networks with unknown and dynamic communication environments.", "authors": ["Keqin Liu", "Qing Zhao"], "n_citation": 24, "references": ["34921587-93dc-47b1-99be-675c5b7994c4", "5f0add17-cc01-4c14-b9f6-0b564ccbbc10", "5f6df04e-c149-4352-857c-fc152047a6d2", "dbedb3f1-02e9-49f7-9271-0d49dda9751e", "f2fee27d-66bb-48f6-affa-c0826c8a8ea2", "f9714d05-c463-497a-bd0b-aaf2aa2a7f78", "fc1351af-b5c6-49c7-826b-9f64202821fa"], "title": "Adaptive shortest-path routing under unknown and stochastically varying link states", "venue": "modeling and optimization in mobile, ad-hoc and wireless networks", "year": 2012, "id": "d16f8988-baa8-4816-a080-4ec188941819"}

{"abstract": "This paper introduces a novel approach to scale symbolic execution --- a program analysis technique for systematic exploration of bounded execution paths---for test input generation. While the foundations of symbolic execution were developed over three decades ago, recent years have seen a real resurgence of the technique, specifically for systematic bug finding. However, scaling symbolic execution remains a primary technical challenge due to the inherent complexity of the path-based exploration that lies at core of the technique.   Our key insight is that the state of the analysis can be represented highly compactly: a test input is all that is needed to effectively encode the state of a symbolic execution run. We present ranged symbolic execution, which embodies this insight and uses two test inputs to define a range, i.e., the beginning and end, for a symbolic execution run. As an application of our approach, we show how it enables scalability by distributing the path exploration---both in a sequential setting with a single worker node and in a parallel setting with multiple workers. As an enabling technology, we leverage the open-source, state-of-the-art symbolic execution tool KLEE. Experimental results using 71 programs chosen from the widely deployed GNU Coreutils set of Unix utilities show that our approach provides a significant speedup over KLEE. For example, using 10 worker cores, we achieve an average speed-up of 6.6X for the 71 programs.", "authors": ["Junaid Haroon Siddiqui", "Sarfraz Khurshid"], "n_citation": 32, "references": ["069f4627-8091-4963-afca-a9b3395452bc", "13c57286-b6b5-4beb-8547-dfb7d1cf40a5", "1c18f7e1-9622-4479-9ad2-a0058b3024bb", "1f61c1ee-fa4d-42d1-9542-a1e1a3ac2901", "2daddb7c-4357-4575-8408-4a880ca870d4", "308f18a7-3535-4a2e-9111-08d1ada36185", "312236d2-d0ef-4802-b85b-407cd3463dc3", "339f1184-af6d-4f5e-b4a4-e4b145dbc352", "41cf9713-ed76-43a6-8e9f-538abc2f787c", "469ccf9a-72db-4a03-ae98-9ca9811f32c3", "47a4cd07-1a37-4e47-b303-9b43e42b39c9", "4a0c5712-d803-422d-96b7-a3bf7e72d69a", "4b4e3539-6ea7-455d-a46a-ff33e3a0f3e3", "4c585613-b10f-4d59-9f36-2967eb2fe85f", "4d4ebe56-acba-49f8-aaa6-14ece5133c9f", "5a126ceb-0ba0-496e-8318-2032e5902ee3", "5c3f1cb9-0ea2-4ebd-9271-19791e07702e", "5e71abfe-65fe-4f6b-9b5b-2337ffb8a175", "68b499aa-8335-4fe9-aff0-703bcad2e303", "6c91615b-709c-4f62-96e5-f756018359fd", "71c47dd0-a7ff-4b97-a640-1186dd9ac968", "7c816204-72a6-43ca-a55e-5d1bfc4c4890", "7ee44c7c-2712-4d16-a9c6-cf4ac3575537", "83faa294-ef5a-4d14-846e-7413b38dc71f", "8873cda3-f462-4b6f-a70c-1271f2f00664", "96842a0a-d4f8-4802-b6ea-a4a40afc73e1", "98e22ff9-3d7f-4377-be70-a0c5861d7346", "99be9fc1-70d4-41bc-8442-37468d67e965", "9b2f9fd4-1073-4512-8be2-e25b25e5c789", "9dc0613b-9cda-4c40-9eb0-8e17a870ae83", "b1a82cb5-5952-4d1f-a82f-8873412fedbe", "be24756a-da45-40e3-8629-1c43f522336f", "bf4d1fd6-f445-41d7-95fc-142167a1f473", "c659438c-7f79-49c8-8fee-f86155373ca2", "c758a152-abe4-43f9-b0e1-013d919a9833", "ca3d097b-3f22-414e-8045-0f6affbaa50a", "d6b825c5-a14c-43c0-9b22-770f1db48715", "de0526f8-c7a6-4134-9b60-5d76d46e080e", "e66874a8-4160-449a-971d-75639c6c2f43", "e901df8f-902d-474c-983e-385e908889b4", "f34d8b47-7c5b-4bde-b666-2f471cc823a8", "f530595d-b277-44fd-91fd-59b9e02547c2", "fa99fa37-a4e8-4a98-a590-f19d7b4d5abe", "fd2ab972-8790-4d67-b1cc-9659a9a67a96", "fd43ff1a-8079-4041-977d-d27b1b3efd3f"], "title": "Scaling symbolic execution using ranged analysis", "venue": "conference on object-oriented programming systems, languages, and applications", "year": 2012, "id": "a961c1ab-9f5e-4dc7-876c-8957dd173645"}

{"abstract": "Network throughput can be increased by dividing the buffer storage associated with each network channel into several virtual channels. Each physical channel is associated with several small queues, virtual channels, rather than a single deep queue. The virtual channels associated with one physical channel are allocated independently but compete with each other for physical bandwidth. Virtual channels decouple buffer resources from transmission resources. This decoupling allows active messages to pass blocked messages using network bandwidth that would otherwise be left idle. The paper studies the performance of networks using virtual channels using both analysis and simulation. These studies show that virtual channels increase network throughput, by a factor of four for 10-stage networks, and reduce the dependence of throughput on the depth of the network. >", "authors": ["William J.

Using intensity-based and color-based cues as well as an articulated 3D body model with shape represented by cylinders, a real-time body tracking in monocular cluttered image sequences has been realized. The algorithm runs at 7.5 Hz on a laptop computer and tracks the upper body of a human with two arms. First, experimental results show that the proposed approach has good tracking as well as recovering capabilities despite using a small number of particles. The approach is intended for use on a mobile robot to improve human robot interaction.", "authors": ["Joachim Schmidt", "Jannik Fritsch", "Bogdan Kwolek"], "n_citation": 78, "references": ["037b9625-bad7-41d3-be15-3d6d109298c2", "0e67159f-09a2-4439-95d3-a7d3cf643613", "1396c562-7652-4373-8cce-4d6db592dca4", "3bca7493-1f33-4110-9026-a03ed25c4316", "4d41f722-c172-40a4-beb4-545d242c09f0", "52bbdf97-9085-4469-a12d-6539258ebd24", "79622519-07fe-4809-ab3b-90c01d6fce5b", "91d399d9-4548-470a-92ab-1c19f1b53e7a", "98491104-9858-49ed-9620-9ffa7f5a9bb9", "aaf92472-4b43-4bf6-9706-574b1dc0cc16", "b5e72744-0105-48bf-95ea-753f52280f48", "d8116977-0962-4d4d-832d-f9b0a095c75c"], "title": "Kernel particle filter for real-time 3D body tracking in monocular color images", "venue": "", "year": 2006, "id": "02069abf-d5d8-4bdb-848f-db0aa07b2d9b"}
{"abstract": "Summary form only given. Since the 1980s, the object of design for dependability has been to avoid, detect or tolerate system faults so that these do not result in failures that are detectable outside the system. Whilst this is potentially achievable in medium size systems that are controlled by a single organisations, it is now practically impossible to achieve in large-scale systems of systems where different parts of the system are owned and controlled by different organisations. Therefore, we must accept the inevitability of failure and re-orient our system design strategies to recover from those failures at minimal cost and as quickly as possible. This talk will discuss why such recovery strategies cannot be purely technical but must be socio-technical in nature and argue that design for recovery will require a better understanding of how people recover from failure and the information they need during that recovery process. I will argue that supporting recovery should be a fundamental design objective of systems and explore what this means for current approaches to large-scale systems design.", "authors": ["Ian Sommerville"], "n_citation": 3, "title": "Designing for Recovery: New Challenges for Large-Scale Complex IT Systems", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "id": "de76302a-d76a-4d80-9643-c98221bac640"}

The network design problem is to find a minimum cost subgraph such that for each vertex set S there are at least f(S) arcs leaving the set S. In the last 10 years general techniques have been developed for designing approximation algorithms for undirected network design problems. Recently, Kamal Jain gave a 2-approximation algorithm for the case when the function f is weakly supermodular. There has been very little progress made on directed network design problems. The main techniques used for the undirected problems do not extend to the directed case.#R##N##R##N#Andras Frank has shown that in a special case when the function f is intersecting supermodular the problem can be solved optimally. In this paper, we use this result to get a 2-approximation algorithm for a more general case when f is crossing supermodular. We also extend Jain's techniques to directed problems.

{"abstract": "Sustainable operation of battery powered wireless embedded systems (such as sensor nodes) is a key challenge, and considerable research effort has been devoted to energy optimization of such systems. Environmental energy harvesting, in particular solar based, has emerged as a viable technique to supplement battery supplies. However, designing an efficient solar harvesting system to realize the potential benefits of energy harvesting requires an in-depth understanding of several factors. For example, solar energy supply is highly time varying and may not always be sufficient to power the embedded system. Harvesting components, such as solar panels, and energy storage elements, such as batteries or ultracapacitors, have different voltage-current characteristics, which must be matched to each other as well as the energy requirements of the system to maximize harvesting efficiency. Further, battery non-idealities, such as self-discharge and round trip efficiency, directly affect energy usage and storage decisions. The ability of the system to modulate its power consumption by selectively deactivating its sub-components also impacts the overall power management architecture. This paper describes key issues and tradeoffs which arise in the design of solar energy harvesting, wireless embedded systems and presents the design, implementation, and performance evaluation of Heliomote, our prototype that addresses several of these issues. Experimental results demonstrate that Heliomote, which behaves as a plug-in to the Berkeley/Crossbow motes and autonomously manages energy harvesting and storage, enables near-perpetual, harvesting aware operation of the sensor node.", "authors": ["Vijay Raghunathan", "Aman Kansal", "Jason C.

{"abstract": "Since the early years of the digital computer era, there has been a continuing attempt to gain processing power by organizing hardware processors so as to achieve some form of parallel operation. One important thread has been the use of an array of processors to allow a single control stream to operate simultaneously on a multiplicity of data streams; the most ambitious effort in this direction has been the ILLIAC IV project. Another important thread has been the partitioning of problems so that several control streams can operate in parallel. Often functions have been unloaded from a central processor onto various specialized processors; examples include data channels, display processors, front-end communication processors, on-line data preprocessors---in fact, I/O processors of all sorts. Similarly, dual processor systems have been used to provide load sharing and increased reliability. Still another thread has been the construction of pipeline systems in which sub-pieces of a single (generally large) processor work in parallel on successive phases of a problem. In some of these pipeline approaches the parallelism is \"hidden\" and the user considers only a single control stream.", "authors": ["F. E. Heart", "S. M. Ornstein", "Warren Crowther", "William B.

The proposed multiple QoS path computation algorithm searches for maximally disjoint (i.e., minimally overlapped) multiple paths such that the impact of link/node failures becomes significantly reduced, and the use of multiple paths renders QoS services more robust in unreliable network conditions. The algorithm is not limited to finding fully disjoint paths. It also exploits partially disjoint paths by carefully selecting and retaining common links in order to produce more options. Moreover, it offers the benefits of load balancing in normal operating conditions by deploying appropriate call allocation methods according to traffic characteristics. In all cases, all the computed paths must satisfy given multiple QoS constraints.

Previous work had concluded that, even in deterministic state spaces, initially uninformed reinforcement learning was at least exponential for such problems, or that it was of polynomial worst-case time-complexity only if the learning methods were augmented. We prove that, to the contrary, the algorithms are tractable with only a simple change in the reward structure (\"penalizing the agent for action executions\") or in the initialization of the values that they maintain. In particular, we provide tight complexity bounds for both Watkins' Q-learning and Heger's Q-hat-learning and show how their complexity depends on properties of the state spaces. We also demonstrate how one can decrease the complexity even further by either learning action models or utilizing prior knowledge of the topology of the state spaces. Our results provide guidance for empirical reinforcement-learning researchers on how to distinguish hard reinforcement-learning problems from easy ones and how to represent them in a way that allows them to be solved efficiently.", "authors": ["Sven Koenig", "Reid G.

{"abstract": "In this paper, our contributions are two-fold: first, we enhance the Min-Min and Sufferage heuristics under three risk modes driven by security concerns. Second, we propose a new space-time genetic algorithm (STGA) for trusted job scheduling, which is very fast and easy to implement. Under our new model, a job can possibly fail if the site security level is lower than the job security demand. We consider three security-driven heuristic modes: secure, risky, and f-risky. The secure mode always dispatches jobs to secure sites meeting the job security demands. The risky mode allocates jobs to any available resource site, taking whatever the risk it may face. The f-risky mode tries to limit the risk to be at most certain probability f. Our extensive simulation results indicated that the proposed STGA is highly effective in scheduling two types of practical workloads: NAS (numerical aerodynamic simulation) and PSA (parameter-sweep application).

{"abstract": "This paper will discuss the problem of designing user-friendly interfaces for computer applications. In particular, we will describe an interface that is based on mapping formal into natural languages in a controlled and structured way.  The basic approaches for designing interfaces range from formal or natural language to menu driven ones. Formal language interfaces such as query or programming languages are typically powerful in terms of their manipulative capabilities, safe in terms of their side effects, and optimized in terms of their execution. However, they often are not especially user-friendly with respect to the formal detail they require users to specify or feedback such as error messages or interactive help when mistakes are made. The necessary semantics for execution are embedded in compilers and not accessible to the user in an understandable way.  Designers of natural language interfaces are generally concerned with anticipating how humans communicate within certain applications: what vocabulary and syntactic constructs need to be handled and what the range of variations or synonyms must be. Natural language query systems are a case in point. They are created to allow users to submit their data base requests in more or less natural language, absorbing the burden of mapping different variations of the natural language expressions into a formal or computer interpretable form, thereby also resolving ambiguities. Even though natural language processing has progressed in the last decade, available natural language interfaces still are disappointing with respect to both their natural language coverage on the one hand and their formal capabilities on the other. Moreover, the customizing process for specific applications is necessarily tedious and requires linguistic expertise.  Menu driven systems guide users through prepared screens to their desired state of affairs. They replace the burden of typing and having to formulate problems by predefined menus with choices that have to be followed. While such an approach clearly defines the capabilities of the system and prevents common mistakes, the implementations of such systems tend to lack in flexibility of maneuvering back and forth between states, of skipping screens and undoing decisions without losing the process up to that point. The result is that users have to cope with too many screens that have to be visited to achieve their goals, particularly once they are familiar with the domain.  Our work, represented by the INTERPRET system, is an attempt to combine the best of all three worlds by taking advantage of the power of the formal languages, the ease and friendliness of natural language and the convenience and error security of menu driven systems. To that end, we \u201cinterpret\u201d a well established formal interface for the user in natural language. This means that rather than anticipating what or and how users might express their goal in natural language, we try to semantically describe an existing formal interface using natural language as the target. The formal interface is thereby enriched through natural language modes: for those users who want to take advantage of the formal interface we provide feedback in form of paraphrases of the formal commands and warnings and error messages of possible problems in their commands (PERFORM); for those users that rather use natural language, we provide a controlled mechanism in natural language to construct their commands in a flexible selection process (CONFORM), where the type of language presented here is almost identical to the language used in the feedback mechanism.  For our prototype we chose SQL, a database query language for relational databases. In designing the feedback or interpretation mechanism (PERFORM), our goal was to preserve as much of the SQL structure as necessary to reflect the internal logic to the user, and at the same time represent as natural English paraphrases as possible. Consider the following SQL query: SELECT DEPT, AVG(COMM), MAX(COMM), MIN(COMM) FROM STAFF, ORG WHERE DEPT = DEPTNO AND SAL > 25000 GROUP BY DEPT which is translated by PERFORM into: Display - for each department - the average, largest, and smallest commission for employees with a salary of more than 25000 dollars.  In order to produce such a paraphrase, PERFORM has a semantic model of the SQL language which is database or application independent. For example, it knows the relationship between the term \u201cDEPT\u201d in the \u201cSELECT\u201d-clause and its occurrence in the \u201cGROUP\u201d-clause. Based on that relationship, PERFORM inserts \u201cfor each\u201d and suppresses the entire translation of \u201cGROUP\u201d-clause, since it is not modified any further. In addition to such application independent knowledge, it also has to model relationships between terms such as \u201cDEPT\u201d and \u201cDEPTNO\u201d. In order to recognize the \u201cWHERE\u201d-clause as a join phrase which is also suppressed in this case, and to realize the semantics of \u201cSAL\u201d, resulting in the insertion of \u201cdollars\u201d PERFORM has to gather database specific information. This is accomplished in an interactive knowledge acquisition or customizing process (CUSTOMIZER) which asks users on the average three questions about each term in their database, including a natural language phrase. With this information we build a lexicon that contains syntactic and semantic records for each item in a database.  The same information is also used by CONFORM which allows users to construct their queries with selections from the screen in natural language where a skeleton of the entire query with windows for selections appears on the screen. Users can scroll within windows and go back and forth between those windows to create and edit their query without having to scroll through many different menus. After selecting a general topic which in database terms corresponds to one or more relations, the following query skeleton appears on the screen:   Find the department id number last name manager salary    for employees with the following restrictions:    with a commission equal to first name ending in job description containing phone number greater than zip code smaller than     The window on line 1 moves horizontally after each selection, the windows of line 3 are repeated after each completed selection below the restriction. The user makes selections at every point before submitting the query which will get translated into SQL by the CONFORM system. Since our natural language scope is rather restrictive, the syntax that INTERPRET recognizes is easily described to and learned by users.  Our technical approach to all three aspects (paraphrase, error message, and controlled natural language input) is based on a syntactic analysis of the input which then gets semantically evaluated with an attribute grammar, resulting in the appropriate output. The semantic information required is mainly of referential and datatyping nature and has to be made available to different parts of the syntactic structure of the input string. The attribute grammar formalism has been very useful for these specific tasks and furthermore offers a consistent and transparent way to incrementally increase the semantic coverage. The PERFORM and CUSTOMIZER modules of INTERPRET are implemented for SQL, its CONFORM counterpart, i.e. the natural language front end is in the implementation stage.  The techniques and philosophy of interpreting formal interfaces through natural language seem also promising for the programming environment in general. The challenge in the programming context is to gain a conceptual understanding of the contents of code that would permit, for example, the generation of more insightful error messages and automatic documentation on the PERFORM side and a controlled natural language environment for the programming task itself on the CONFORM side.", "authors": ["Eva-Martin Mueckstein"], "n_citation": 15, "title": "Controlled natural language interfaces (extended abstract): the best of three worlds", "venue": "conference on scientific computing", "year": 1985, "id": "08eed4d8-0e87-415d-86d0-ba3eb042c842"}
{"abstract": "One of the main reasons why cloud computing has gained so much popularity is due to its ease of use and its ability to scale computing resources on demand. As a result, users can now rent computing nodes on large commercial clusters through several vendors, such as Amazon and rackspace. However, despite the attention paid by Cloud providers, performance unpredictability is a major issue in Cloud computing for (1) database researchers performing wall clock experiments, and (2) database applications providing service-level agreements. In this paper, we carry out a study of the performance variance of the most widely used Cloud infrastructure (Amazon EC2) from different perspectives. We use established microbenchmarks to measure performance variance in CPU, I/O, and network. And, we use a multi-node MapReduce application to quantify the impact on real dataintensive applications. We collected data for an entire month and compare it with the results obtained on a local cluster. Our results show that EC2 performance varies a lot and often falls into two bands having a large performance gap in-between --- which is somewhat surprising. We observe in our experiments that these two bands correspond to the different virtual system types provided by Amazon. Moreover, we analyze results considering different availability zones, points in time, and locations.

We conducted qualitative, exploratory research with lead and core developers on three successful projects on GitHub to understand how OSS communities on GitHub measure success. These results were obtained in connection with a larger project that is designed to understand the structure of code hosting platforms in relation to participation and performance.

{"abstract": "In the last two decades there have been studies claiming that science is becoming ever more interdisciplinary. However, the evidence has been anecdotal or partial. Here we investigate how the degree of interdisciplinarity has changed between 1975 and 2005 over six research domains. To do so, we compute well-established bibliometric indicators alongside a new index of interdisciplinarity (Integration score, aka Rao-Stirling diversity) and a science mapping visualization method. The results attest to notable changes in research practices over this 30 year period, namely major increases in number of cited disciplines and references per article (both show about 50% growth), and co-authors per article (about 75% growth). However, the new index of interdisciplinarity only shows a modest increase (mostly around 5% growth). Science maps hint that this is because the distribution of citations of an article remains mainly within neighboring disciplinary areas. These findings suggest that science is indeed becoming more interdisciplinary, but in small steps \u2014 drawing mainly from neighboring fields and only modestly increasing the connections to distant cognitive areas. The combination of metrics and overlay science maps provides general benchmarks for future studies of interdisciplinary research characteristics.", "authors": ["Alan L.

{"abstract": "Android phones come with a host of hardware components embedded in them, such as Camera, Media Player and Sensor. Most of these components are exclusive resources or resources consuming more memory/energy than general. And they should be explicitly released by developers.

This paper focuses on resource leak problems in Android apps, and presents our lightweight static analysis tool called Relda, which can automatically analyze an application's resource operations and locate the resource leaks.

First, we categorize areas of analysis for Web merchandising such as product assortment, merchandising cues, shopping metaphors, and Web design features. Second, we define a new set of metrics for Web merchandising, which we call micro-conversion rates. These new metrics provide capabilities for examining data about sales and merchandising in online stores, and also provide detailed insight into the effectiveness of different Web merchandising efforts by answering related business questions. Third, we present a set of novel visualizations that explore patterns in micro-conversions in online stores reflecting in customer responses to various Web merchandising efforts. Through an empirical study using look-to-buy data from an online store, we demonstrate how the proposed visualizations can be used to understand the shopping behavior in an online store and the effectiveness of various merchandising tactics it employs.

{"abstract": "We continue the study initiated in [Ro01] on Stackelberg Scheduling Strategies. We are given a set of n independent parallel machines or equivalently a set of n parallel edges on which certain flow has to be sent. Each edge e is endowed with a latency function l{sub e}({center_dot}). The setting is that of a non-cooperative game: players choose edges so as minimize their individual latencies. Additionally, there is a single player who control as fraction ?? of the total flow. The goal is to find a strategy for the leader (i.e. an assignment of flow to indivual links) such that the selfish users react so as to minimize the total latency of the system. Building on the recent results in [Ro01, RT00], we show the following: 1. We devise a fully polynomial approximate scheme for the problem of finding the cheapest Stackelberg Strategy: given a performance requirement, our algorithm runs in time polynomial in n and {var_epsilon} and produces a Stackelberg strategy s, whose associated cost is within a 1 + {var_epsilon} factor of the optimum stackelberg strategy s*. The result is extended to obtain a polynomial-approximation scheme when instances are restricted to layered directed graphs in which each layer has a bounded number of vertices. 2. We then consider a two round Stackelberg strategy (denoted 2SS). In this strategy, the game consists of three rounds: a move by the leader followed by the moves of all the followers folowed again by a move by the leader who possibly reassigns some of the flows. We show that 2SS always dominates the one round scheme, and for some classes of latency functions, is guaranteed to be closer to the global social optimum. We also consider the variant where the leader plays after the selfish users have routed themselves, and observe that this dominates the one-round scheme. Extensions of the results to the special case when all the latency functions are linear are also presented. Our results extend the earlier results and answer an open question posed by Roughgarden [Ro01].", "authors": ["A. (Anil) Kumar", "Madhav V. Marathe", "R. J. (Richard J.)

The distinct advantage over other control strategies is that input and system constraints are able to be handled straightforwardly in the optimization problem so that the robot can travel safely with a high velocity.

{"abstract": "One aspect of security in mobile code is privacy: private (or secret) data should not be leaked to unauthorised agents. Most of the work on secure information flow has until recently only been concerned with detecting direct and indirect flows. Secret information can however be leaked to the attacker also through covert channels. It is very reasonable to assume that the attacker, even as an external observer, can monitor the timing (including termination) behaviour of the program. Thus to claim a program secure, the security analysis must take also these into account.  In this work we present a surprisingly simple solution to the problem of detecting timing leakages to external observers. Our system consists of a type system in which well-typed programs do not leak secret information directly, indirectly or through timing, and a transformation for removing timing leakages. For any program that is well typed according to Volpano and Smith [VS97a], our transformation generates a program that is also free of timing leaks.", "authors": ["Johan Agat"], "n_citation": 350, "references": ["16d386b0-fbe6-4df6-b1c2-db63aab8e1fa", "1baeeaaf-052d-4fa9-873f-4f6528389e30", "337c62df-2b46-421a-8000-f3217601a9da", "46458c0c-53af-4709-a809-78bcf9cf5b59", "4cf71bbe-e23a-44df-89c3-a7b9e2dbeceb", "65cb8b4d-b4ff-4db8-9852-18f78138eaaa", "69eae630-9064-4258-a1c0-187cf48c8b6b", "706da441-c9f3-47b8-a952-f8665b1514fc", "adbe7f7f-95ef-4ddf-ad5e-5fcc9252934f", "b62a2f03-8c81-42a8-92e6-79a6994780d3", "b634b58b-7c58-4894-bbce-135d53637547", "b738a726-7380-4989-ba7b-d595ef736bab", "bf66530e-2c37-483b-8ed5-70a58d7a5f94", "c5920c8a-ace1-48a2-bf68-67f3c6d41512", "d0b15cdd-9842-4716-b267-5834aaa5d722", "e1630f39-05cd-45f6-a712-14b96dab6ef9", "f3eee849-48ce-480c-a8ac-69030264c772", "fe9d2177-5770-40ec-acd2-2fc1ce394947"], "title": "Transforming out timing leaks", "venue": "symposium on principles of programming languages", "year": 2000, "id": "4271f7e3-98fb-413b-abc2-b5981c8e985a"}

{"abstract": "Automatic speech recognition (ASR) technology has matured over the past few decades and has made significant impacts in a variety of fields, from assistive technologies to commercial products. However, ASR system development is a resource intensive activity and requires language resources in the form of text annotated audio recordings and pronunciation dictionaries. Unfortunately, many languages found in the developing world fall into the resource-scarce category and due to this resource scarcity the deployment of ASR systems in the developing world is severely inhibited. One approach to assist with resource-scarce ASR system development, is to select \"useful\" training samples which could reduce the resources needed to collect new corpora. In this work, we propose a new data selection framework which can be used to design a speech recognition corpus. We show for limited data sets, independent of language and bandwidth, the most effective strategy for data selection is frequency-matched selection and that the widely-used maximum entropy methods generally produced the least promising results. In our model, the frequency-matched selection method corresponds to a logarithmic relationship between accuracy and corpus size; we also investigated other model relationships, and found that a hyperbolic relationship (as suggested from simple asymptotic arguments in learning theory) may lead to somewhat better performance under certain conditions.", "authors": ["Neil Kleynhans", "Etienne Barnard"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0733127c-4be1-4007-b110-ec13c2c867b7", "2c026623-a330-4e5c-b67b-aa739b9701c4", "5ad5ecd7-6e23-4230-9833-747c9a2f0e17", "7a246e3b-091a-4730-890a-ef9203b4f20a", "84cf1670-aeaf-497b-9f75-e4bef8536918", "9d5390e2-b5c7-47e4-aa41-f7dd9a65783e", "e5d6eaed-06a4-45d2-a89c-747c02321414"], "title": "Efficient data selection for ASR", "venue": "language resources and evaluation", "year": 2015, "id": "a1ee2a00-1cc6-44a6-a6db-159f5a3e443c"}

{"abstract": "Ensembles of learning machines are promising for software effort estimation (SEE), but need to be tailored for this task to have their potential exploited. A key issue when creating ensembles is to produce diverse and accurate base models. Depending on how differently different performance measures behave for SEE, they could be used as a natural way of creating SEE ensembles. We propose to view SEE model creation as a multiobjective learning problem. A multiobjective evolutionary algorithm (MOEA) is used to better understand the tradeoff among different performance measures by creating SEE models through the simultaneous optimisation of these measures. We show that the performance measures behave very differently, presenting sometimes even opposite trends. They are then used as a source of diversity for creating SEE ensembles. A good tradeoff among different measures can be obtained by using an ensemble of MOEA solutions. This ensemble performs similarly or better than a model that does not consider these measures explicitly. Besides, MOEA is also flexible, allowing emphasis of a particular measure if desired. In conclusion, MOEA can be used to better understand the relationship among performance measures and has shown to be very effective in creating SEE models.", "authors": ["Leandro L.

Simply scaling existing synchronization systems to WSN data rates consumes more power than the entire allotted node budget. In this work, simplification of synchronization requirements was achieved through system level design of modulation scheme, data rate, packet length, and clock accuracy. Analog and digital implementations of the resulting synchronization functions are explored. A digital implementation was chosen because it requires a smaller header length and therefore reduces system energy consumption. The chosen scheme achieves better than 1e/sup -4/ BER at 13 dB SNR, an implementation loss of 1.6 dB over the ideal detection case, while consuming under 300 /spl mu/W.", "authors": ["M.

{"abstract": "Future wireless/mobile system is expected to have heterogeneous wireless overlay networks for ubiquitous multimedia communication. In a such network environment, mobile users are likely to try to get attached to higher bandwidth network as bandwidth-hungry multimedia applications are increasing. However, the users have to perform vertical handoff to lower bandwidth network, as high bandwidth network become unavailable due to various reasons (such as its limited coverage, network congestion, etc.). In this paper, we discuss the problem of vertical handoff from a user's perspective. For this purpose, we formulate user satisfaction as a function of bandwidth utility and handoff latency. Then, we investigate the effect of call holding time, user movement probability, etc. on the satisfaction that a user derives from the use of network service for multimedia applications. In addition, based on the evaluation, we present an algorithm for selecting a wireless network, which maximizes the effective user satisfaction.", "authors": ["Ved P.

{"abstract": "This work focuses on congestion-driven placement of standard cells into rows in the  fixed-die  context. We summarize the state-of-the-art after two decades of research in recursive bisection placement and implement a new placer, called  Capo , to empirically study the achievable limits of the approach. From among recently proposed improvements to recursive bisection, Capo incorporates a leading-edge multilevel min-cut partitioner [7], techniques for partitioning with small tolerance [8], optimal min-cut partitioners and end-case min-wirelength placers [5], previously unpublished partitioning tolerance computations, and block splitting heuristics. On the other hand, our \u201cgood enough\u201d implementation does  not  use \u201coverlapping\u201d [17], multi-way partitioners [17, 20], analytical placement, or congestion estimation [24, 35]. In order to run on recent industrial placement instances, Capo must take into account fixed macros, power stripes and rows with different allowed cell orientations. Capo reads industry-standard LEF/DEF, as well as formats of the GSRC bookshelf for VLSI CAD algorithms [6], to enable comparisons on available placement instances in the fixed-die regime.  Capo clearly demonstrates that despite a potential mismatch of objectives, improved mincut bisection can still lead to improved placement wirelength and congestion. Our experiments on recent industrial benchmarks fail to give a  clear  answer to the question in the title of this paper. However, they validate a series of improvements to recursive bisection and point out a need for  transparent  congestion management techniques that do not worsen the wirelength of already routable placements. Our experimental flow, which validates fixed-die placement results by violation-free detailed auto-routability, provides a new norm for comparison of VLSI placement implementations.", "authors": ["Andrew E.

{"abstract": "The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) is the primary database resource of the Japanese GenomeNet service (http://www.genome.ad.jp/) for understanding higher order functional meanings and utilities of the cell or the organism from its genome information. KEGG consists of the PATHWAY database for the computerized knowledge on molecular interaction networks such as pathways and complexes, the GENES database for the information about genes and proteins generated by genome sequencing projects, and the LIGAND database for the information about chemical compounds and chemical reactions that are relevant to cellular processes. In addition to these three main databases, limited amounts of experimental data for microarray gene expression profiles and yeast two-hybrid systems are stored in the EXPRESSION and BRITE databases, respectively. Furthermore, a new database, named SSDB, is available for exploring the universe of all protein coding genes in the complete genomes and for identifying functional links and ortholog groups. The data objects in the KEGG databases are all represented as graphs and various computational methods are developed to detect graph features that can be related to biological functions. For example, the correlated clusters are graph similarities which can be used to predict a set of genes coding for a pathway or a complex, as summarized in the ortholog group tables, and the cliques in the SSDB graph are used to annotate genes.

{"abstract": "Complex software is becoming an important component of modern safety-critical systems. To assure the correct function of such software, the development processes are heavily regulated by international standards, often making the process very rigid, unable to accommodate changes, causing late integration and increasing the cost of development. Agile methods have been introduced to address these issues in several software domains, but their use in safety-critical applications remains to be investigated. This paper provides an initial analysis of agile practices in the context of software development for the European railway sector, regulated by the EN 50128 standard. The study complements previous studies on the use of agile methods in other regulated domains. A systematic mapping between EN 50128 requirements and agile practices showed that all practices support some objectives of the standard. Important supporting features recognized were focus on simple design, test automation, coding standards, continuous integration and validation. However, several problematic areas were also identified, including vague requirement analysis and change management. Most agile practices must be adapted to suit regulated software development and this analysis outlines a subset of the required changes.", "authors": ["Henrik Jonsson", "Stig Larsson", "Sasikumar Punnekkat"], "n_citation": 25, "references": ["8c0ba53a-9268-4e20-989d-47d89246d3f3", "d011ca3c-d29f-47f1-9169-b889cd88c546", "d09fc4ab-38a5-4798-8711-48cbce1db68f"], "title": "Agile Practices in Regulated Railway Software Development", "venue": "international symposium on software reliability engineering", "year": 2012, "id": "dfb18b8f-33eb-44de-bad5-a375cb79a66d"}

As an example, the problem of storing the Tresor de la Langue Francaise on a CD-ROM is examined in this paper. The text alone of this database is 700 megabytes long, more than a CD-ROM can hold. In addition, the dictionary and concordance needed to access these data must be stored. A further constraint is that some of the material is copyrighted, and it is desirable that such material be difficult to decode except through software provided by the system.

{"abstract": "Mutation testing is effective at measuring the adequacy of a test suite, but it can be computationally expensive to apply all the test cases to each mutant. Previous research has investigated the effect of reducing the number of mutants by selecting certain operators, sampling mutants at random, or combining them to form new higher-order mutants. In this paper, we propose a new approach to the mutant reduction problem using static analysis. Symbolic representations are generated for the output along the paths through each mutant and these are compared with the original program. By calculating the range of their output expressions, it is possible to determine the effect of each mutation on the program output. Mutants with little effect on the output are harder to kill. We confirm this using random testing and an established test suite. Competent programmers are likely to only make small mistakes in their programming code. We argue therefore that test suites should be evaluated against those mutants that are harder to kill without being equivalent to the original program.", "authors": ["Matthew Patrick", "Manuel Oriol", "John A.

{"abstract": "We describe a framework for compositional verification of finite-state processes. The framework is based on two ideas: a subset of the logic CTL for which satisfaction is preserved under composition, and a preorder on structures which captures the relation between a component and a system containing the component. Satisfaction of a formula in the logic corresponds to being below a particular structure (a tableau for the formula) in the preorder. We show how to do assume-guarantee-style reasoning within this framework. Additionally, we demonstrate efficient methods for model checking in the logic and for checking the preorder in several special cases. We have implemented a system based on these methods, and we use it to give a compositional verification of a CPU controller.", "authors": ["Orna Grumberg", "David E.

{"abstract": "Research in the information systems (IS) field has often been characterized as fragmented. This paper builds on a belief that for the field to move forward and have an impact on practitioners and other academic fields, the existing work must be examined and systematized. It is particularly important to systematize research on the factors that underlie success of organizational IS. The goal here is to conceptualize the IS success antecedents (ISSA) area of research through surveying, synthesizing, and explicating the work in the domain. Using a combination of qualitative and quantitative research methods, a taxonomy of 12 general categories is created, and existing research within each category is examined. Important lacunae in the direction of work have been determined. It is found that little work has been conducted on the macro-level independent variables, the most difficult variables to assess, although these variables may be the most important to understanding the ultimate value of IS to organizations. Similarly, ISSA research on success variables of consequence to organizations was found severely lacking. Variable analysis research on organizational-level success variables was found to be literally nonexistent in the IS field, whereas research in the organizational studies field was found to provide useful directions for IS researchers. The specifics of the 12 taxonomy areas are analyzed and directions for research in each of them provided. Thus, researchers and practitioners are directed toward available research and receive suggestions for future work to bring ISSA research toward an organized and cohesive future.", "authors": ["Kai Larsen"], "n_citation": 178, "references": ["1c95d184-179f-44d1-88a8-5fab9e567e69", "3c610c54-8cea-403a-a579-170adf954ea7", "5d7a48c5-605f-45df-856c-7053120194fc", "74edc0a0-7b35-4fa5-b84f-1b29fe6e819e", "75d8ab95-1ba2-4b01-8116-db38af939fd2", "c7dd6f19-f9a3-4dd8-9b6a-b9bc63f9e2a1", "d8d70002-8de8-4da8-b647-b9f32e5ac6b5", "e8f9cfeb-2070-41c9-b878-b880e49aa6b9", "ef56e52a-94b1-4f41-8ff7-fee4c58612c3", "f0fc02ba-3919-4c4f-a607-fe064d22bb56", "f3834c78-97f9-4c54-bad4-3c013c6c1c10", "fe2918f3-a823-44cc-ae45-5ae902336497"], "title": "A Taxonomy of Antecedents of Information Systems Success: Variable Analysis Studies", "venue": "Journal of Management Information Systems", "year": 2003, "id": "91893074-5f2e-45b8-a796-e34563ede7c5"}

{"abstract": "A new method for efficient recognition of general relational structures is described and compared with existing methods. Patterns to be recognized are defined by templates consisting of a set of predicate calculus relations. Productions are representable by associating actions with templates. A network for recognizing occurrences of any of the template patterns in data may be automatically compiled. The compiled network is economical in the sense that conjunctive products (subsets) of relations common to several templates are represented in and computed by the network only once. The recognition network operates in a bottom-up fashion, in which all possibilities for pattern matches are evaluated simultaneously. The distribution of the recognition process throughout the network means that it can readily be decomposed into parallel processes for use on a multiprocessor machine. The method is expected to be especially useful in errorful domains (e.g., vision, speech) where parallel treatment of alternative hypotheses is desired. The network is illustrated with an example from the current syntax and semantics module in the Hearsay II speech understanding system.", "authors": ["Frederick Hayes-Roth", "David J.

Both algorithms are easily generalized to larger neural networks, and the generalization of gradient descent is the standard backpropagation algorithm. We prove worst-case loss bounds for both algorithms in the single neuron case. Since local minima make it difficult to prove worst case bounds for gradient-based algorithms, we must use a loss function that prevents the formation of spurious local minima. We define such a matching loss function for any strictly increasing differentiable transfer function and prove worst-case loss bounds for any such transfer function and its corresponding matching loss. The different forms of the two algorithms' bounds indicates that exponentiated gradient outperforms gradient descent when the inputs contain a large number of irrelevant components.

{"abstract": "Web service compositions in BPEL have several nonfunctional requirements such as security, reliable messaging, and transactions. Although many WS-* specifications address such non-functional concerns in the Web service context, they focus only on the messaging-level requirements without addressing the process-level requirements. In this paper, we discuss different non-functional requirements in BPEL workflows and observe that current orchestration engines lack support for the specification and enforcement of such requirements, especially for process-level requirements. To solve this problem, we present a container framework, which introduces an XML-based deployment descriptor to specify the non-functional requirements in a declarative way. To enforce these requirements, a process container intercepts the process execution and calls dedicated middleware Web services. We implemented the process container as a lightweight container using a set of A04BPEL aspects that are automatically generated from the deployment descriptor.

{"abstract": "Abstract   In this paper we describe a Hough transform algorithm for finding lines in an image that can have an order of magnitude denser sampling in both parameters of the parameter space without significant increase in required memory or overhead in CPU time.  By increasing the sampling density we determine the line parameters for each line segment much more accurately.

{"abstract": "The goal of this paper is to develop an underwater robot with a buoyancy control system based on the spermaceti oil hypothesis. Sperm whales have a spermaceti organ in their head that is filled with spermaceti oil. Spermaceti oil is high quality oil and was used as material for candles, lubricant, and so on. There is a hypothesis about spermaceti oil that insists that sperm whales melt and congeal their spermaceti oil and change the volume of the oil to control their own buoyancy. This hypothesis appears suitable for the underwater robot because no materials for the ballast, such as sea water taken in at another place and iron, are discarded in the sea. To choose the best material as a spermaceti oil substitute, we measured the densities of four materials at both liquid and solid states, and calculated their buoyancy differences between both states. From the results, we concluded that the paraffin wax was the best material because its buoyancy difference is the largest of the four and its melting point is relatively low. Next, we directly measured the buoyancy of the paraffin wax and found that a particular arrangement of nichrome wire, which heats the oil, increases the level of buoyancy. Finally, we developed an underwater robot with a buoyancy control system based on this hypothesis. We measured its buoyancy and succeeded in surfacing of the robot in a small water tank.", "authors": ["Koji Shibuya", "Yuichi Kado", "Suguru Honda", "Taro Iwamoto", "Kazuyoshi Tsutsumi"], "n_citation": 50, "references": [], "title": "Underwater Robot with a Buoyancy Control System Based on the Spermaceti Oil Hypothesis", "venue": "intelligent robots and systems", "year": 2006, "id": "203b566c-13e2-4b4e-9e07-1aabae821845"}

{"abstract": "Software process simulation modeling (SPSM) research has increased since the first ProSim workshop held in 1998 and Kellner, Madachy and Raffo (KMR) discussed the \"why, what and how\" of process simulation. This paper aims to assess how SPSM has evolved during the past 10 years in particular whether the reasons for SPSM, the simulation paradigms, tools, problem domains, and model scopes have changed. We performed a systematic literature review of software process simulation papers from the ProSim series publications in the last decade. We identified 96 studies from the sources and included them in this review. The papers were categorized into four major types and data needed to address each research question was extracted. We found a need for refining the reasons and the classification scheme for SPSM introduced by KMR. More emerging SPSM paradigms and model scopes were added to enhance KMR's discussion. Trends over time showed that interest in continuous modeling was decreasing and interest in micro-processes was increasing. Hybrid models were based primarily on system dynamics and discrete event simulation and were all implemented by vertical integration.

It leads to an extension of the well-known version space learning framework. In order to do that, we emphasize that the treatment of positive and negative examples in version space learning is reminding of a bipolar revision process recently studied in the setting of possibilistic information representation. Bipolarity appears when the positive and negative sides of information are specified in a distinct way. Then, we use the possibilistic bipolar representation setting, which distinguishes between what is guaranteed to be possible, and what is simply not impossible, as a basis for extending version space learning to examples associated with possibility degrees.

{"abstract": "We develop a method of sparse decomposition of stereo audio signals, and test its application to blind separation of more than two sources from only two linear mixtures. The decomposition is done in a stereo dictionary which we can define based on any standard time-frequency or time-scale dictionary, such as the multiscale Gabor dictionary. A decomposition of a stereo mixture in the dictionary is computed with a Matching Pursuit type algorithm called Stereo Matching Pursuit. We experiment an application to blind source separation with three (mono) sources mixed on two channels. We cluster the parameters of the stereo atoms of the decomposition to estimate the mixing parameters, and recover estimates. of the sources by a partial reconstruction using only the appropriate atoms of the decomposition. The method outperforms the best achievable linear demixing by 3 dB to more than 7 dB on our preliminary experiments, and its performance should increase as we let the number of iterations of the pursuit increase.

{"abstract": "Internet search is one of the most important applications of the Web. A search engine takes the user's keywords to retrieve and to rank those pages that contain the keywords. One shortcoming of existing search techniques is that they do not give due consideration to the micro-structures of a Web page. A Web page is often populated with a number of small information units, which we call  micro information units  (MIU). Each unit focuses on a specific topic and occupies a specific area of the page. During the search, if all the keywords in the user query occur in a single MIU of a page, the top ranking results returned by a search engine are generally relevant and useful. However, if the query words scatter at different MIUs in a page, the pages returned can be quite irrelevant (which causes low precision). The reason for this is that although a page has information on individual MIUs, it may not have information on their intersections. In this paper, we propose a technique to solve this problem. At the off-line pre-processing stage, we segment each page to identify the MIUs in the page, and index the keywords of the page according to the MIUs in which they occur. In searching, our retrieval and ranking algorithm utilizes this additional information to return those most relevant pages. Experimental results show that this method is able to significantly improve the search precision.", "authors": ["Xiao-Li Li", "Tong-Heng Phang", "Minqing Hu", "Bing Liu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0895c22d-37c5-4c8f-9202-a32ebd2cb0c0", "1170c617-0e1e-4287-ad3e-77f145ccb407", "2f15c3e9-12f8-495b-b64a-99fca81cce1f", "3fabddff-8565-41bb-8493-a02e3f8f3bb5", "45e54ec5-50bd-4ec9-8c0f-725953ef04db", "46676411-d1de-4876-97f1-c644ceaec792", "49be9502-bcca-4ec2-ba06-ed5fc6e60341", "5424b7dc-4d34-4e0b-9a70-7a3ee4c3e1f4", "81e41f07-efa7-47fd-9e99-d14e04fe32b7", "994ae82e-8fbd-47ee-a132-d4b0743d546f", "9a7ba5bb-acae-4106-8f85-f17091bf5815", "a1d0f2c9-4ad4-4700-8ee6-b580bffedd67", "bb74ee29-c9bd-4ed8-978c-295045e24594", "c3e8c0e1-fb5a-427c-819b-e09e02520341", "c7e4e04b-45da-4bae-8c8a-d17ca0087361", "d008d10b-5417-41ce-9cb9-6756b87f8f33", "d0c30ab3-381e-4b4b-8ef7-4014873b5daf", "dced76c0-4a97-4eaa-b524-cb18f10d09d1"], "title": "Using micro information units for internet search", "venue": "conference on information and knowledge management", "year": 2002, "id": "9de3992f-8158-49ee-9fb0-538e49f8bb67"}

{"abstract": "An approach to robot perception and world modeling that uses a probabilistic tesselated representation of spatial information called the occupancy grid is reviewed. The occupancy grid is a multidimensional random field that maintains stochastic estimates of the occupancy state of the cells in a spatial lattice. To construct a sensor-derived map of the robot's world, the cell state estimates are obtained by interpreting the incoming range readings using probabilistic sensor models. Bayesian estimation procedures allow the incremental updating of the occupancy grid, using readings taken from several sensors over multiple points of view. The use of occupancy grids from mapping and for navigation is examined. Operations on occupancy grids and extensions of the occupancy grid framework are briefly considered. >", "authors": ["Alberto Elfes"], "n_citation": 1883, "references": ["63191777-9075-40a1-9efb-574c2f494442", "c4531ff2-9688-4e3c-b4b1-0507104c9505", "d0764d51-2bd0-4f40-8f00-6f821dcfdff3"], "title": "Using occupancy grids for mobile robot perception and navigation", "venue": "IEEE Computer", "year": 1989, "id": "44ea6eea-9cad-4a43-af56-c923305b20f6"}

{"abstract": "Formal methods for task management for human operators are gathering increasing attention to improve efficiency of human-in-the-loop systems. In this paper, we consider a novel dynamical queue approach to intelligent task management for human operators. We consider a model of a dynamical queue, where the service time depends on the server utilization history. The proposed queueing model is motivated by, but not restricted to, widely accepted empirical laws describing human performance as a function of mental arousal. The focus of the paper is to characterize the throughput of the dynamical queue and design corresponding maximally stabilizing task release control policies, assuming deterministic arrivals. We focus extensively on threshold policies that release a task to the server only when the server state is less than a certain threshold. When every task brings in the same deterministic amount of work, we give an exact characterization of the throughput and show that an appropriate threshold policy is maximally stabilizing. The technical approach exploits the optimality of the one-task equilibria class associated with the server dynamics. When the amount of work associated with the tasks is an independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) random variable with finite support, we show that the maximum throughput increases in comparison to the case where the tasks have the same deterministic amount of work. Finally, we provide preliminary empirical evidence in support of the applicability of the proposed approach to systems with human operators.", "authors": ["Ketan Savla", "Emilio Frazzoli"], "n_citation": 46, "references": ["596b6905-77be-4a10-a770-7e5e550661b2", "8aac6560-bd37-4bf3-a663-a3117e428152", "afcbfb19-7b9c-461d-a02c-7d2ee31a02cc", "ff750c53-9286-4f6a-8d64-f27c56025be5"], "title": "A Dynamical Queue Approach to Intelligent Task Management for Human Operators", "venue": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "year": 2012, "id": "9336601f-39fb-429f-b6bf-1c20ac858c14"}

Both employers and job seekers pointed to specific cues provided on profiles that led them to make inferences (or form impressions) about a candidate's technical skills, motivations, and values. These cues were seen as more reliable indicators of technical abilities and motivation than information provided on a resume, because of the transparency of work actions on GitHub and relative difficulty of manipulating behavior traces.

{"abstract": "Twitter is one of the biggest platforms where massive instant messages (i.e. tweets) are published every day. Users tend to express their real feelings freely in Twitter, which makes it an ideal source for capturing the opinions towards various interesting topics, such as brands, products or celebrities, etc. Naturally, people may anticipate an approach to receiving the common sentiment tendency towards these topics directly rather than through reading the huge amount of tweets about them. On the other side, Hashtags, starting with a symbol \"#\" ahead of keywords or phrases, are widely used in tweets as coarse-grained topics. In this paper, instead of presenting the sentiment polarity of each tweet relevant to the topic, we focus our study on hashtag-level sentiment classification. This task aims to automatically generate the overall sentiment polarity for a given hashtag in a certain time period, which markedly differs from the conventional sentence-level and document-level sentiment analysis. Our investigation illustrates that three types of information is useful to address the task, including (1) sentiment polarity of tweets containing the hashtag; (2) hashtags co-occurrence relationship and (3) the literal meaning of hashtags. Consequently, in order to incorporate the first two types of information into a classification framework where hashtags can be classified collectively, we propose a novel graph model and investigate three approximate collective classification algorithms for inference. Going one step further, we show that the performance can be remarkably improved using an enhanced boosting classification setting in which we employ the literal meaning of hashtags as semi-supervised information. Experimental results on a real-life data set consisting of 29,195 tweets and 2,181 hashtags show the effectiveness of the proposed model and algorithms.", "authors": ["Xiaolong Wang", "Furu Wei", "Xiaohua Liu", "Ming Zhou", "Ming Zhang"], "n_citation": 227, "references": ["05268346-81e5-4a59-b6e6-9e7d0ca204eb", "06ca8a5b-70f1-4986-93b9-766c5fa9d0ca", "0a4f0020-c885-45ba-bbf8-ac29ba05d0e9", "1f47e848-ab80-41af-88b1-b58dae33ea77", "2ad2cdc1-907f-42ac-8a42-bc4702238357", "37999e42-d0fc-4ec4-872d-47bba582e161", "393ff07b-660b-4283-94a4-ac031c761c61", "3a8504ae-d6bf-443f-ac53-101e86af2e02", "3bd50307-1fee-4317-8b2f-7bf2eaf2eb6a", "3d1d29d1-5720-41e0-a984-6882b9774566", "3f303c85-3658-4c4f-bd86-68d21b03be94", "50dd56db-151d-4d62-8576-65f0ef6f381b", "5f549847-0e96-4020-ac68-06ee4f18bf4b", "707ad313-8047-4f3c-84c0-90cd574aeeec", "71c92f94-450d-49e7-afda-13062140918f", "8ae9fa66-1466-4c15-810a-945f97f5a07f", "8bf8fa2a-019f-4e9c-939c-7f1e53e37c0f", "a89cd814-5a09-4509-8710-1e0d1b253d51", "ad58ad26-3128-4a36-b9b4-5109b6fee4cb", "b099c8ef-a537-445b-9796-de1fa6f0fdd1", "c9ea1ab7-b2db-4c0f-9696-80e3310cec6c", "d924ecc1-ce71-4250-ae5d-570769554f74", "ed543a19-85d9-427a-a2d3-88e7c59a100e", "f209f74a-76fc-4c71-89b4-98d3a97cd94d", "f65eafab-1d85-4bf5-92f0-0eb640a64ce0"], "title": "Topic sentiment analysis in twitter: a graph-based hashtag sentiment classification approach", "venue": "conference on information and knowledge management", "year": 2011, "id": "f9b472d9-29cc-4bb8-83e8-6e2b7d12f519"}
{"abstract": "The traditional focus of relational query optimization schemes has been on the choice of join methods and join orders. Restrictions have typically been handled in query optimizers by \u201cpredicate pushdown\u201d rules, which apply restrictions in some random order before as many joins as possible. These rules work under the assumption that restriction is essentially a zero-time operation. However, today's extensible and object-oriented database systems allow users to define time-consuming functions, which may be used in a query's restriction and join predicates. Furthermore, SQL has long supported subquery predicates, which may be arbitrarily time-consuming to check. Thus restrictions should not be considered zero-time operations, and the model of query optimization must be enhanced.  In this paper we develop a theory for moving expensive predicates in a query plan so that the total cost of the plan \u2014 including the costs of both joins and restrictions \u2014 is minimal. We present an algorithm to implement the theory, as well as results of our implementation in POSTGRES. Our experience with the newly enhanced POSTGRES query optimizer demonstrates that correctly optimizing queries with expensive predicates often produces plans that are orders of magnitude faster than plans generated by a traditional query optimizer.

{"abstract": "Abstract   We present in this paper an operational semantics for the  ELECTRE  reactive language (Roux et al., 1992). This language is based on an asynchronous approach to real-time systems. First basic concepts and intuitive semantics are introduced. Then we give rules to model dynamic semantics of  ELECTRE  programs: this constitutes an operational semantics for the  ELECTRE  language. This operational semantics is used to define a model of execution for  ELECTRE  programs: transition system. In addition, we prove, using structural induction on the operational semantics, that this transition system is a  finite  state transition system. Eventually, we extend the previous transition system so as to handle multiple-storage events: it is important since the asynchronous  ELECTRE  language deals with multiple memorized occurrences of the events.  This result gives a means of compiling the  ELECTRE  language into a finite-state machine.", "authors": ["Franck Cassez", "Roux O"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["4814eca2-167a-48bd-a7e6-60150e7a54e3", "4b8d5647-b891-4bd0-b974-010bb0a27d6f", "52391e5d-c3cb-4313-b139-5d60a38f480e", "52dca88c-1309-4ce1-9f9d-8314f108ec1d", "66cd0244-d47f-48ec-82a2-53d60fe01504", "8622d948-009a-4e9e-b337-e99c70b017c9", "8d1688b3-232b-4c48-80f6-d7f5e1b732d8", "8ecea8bb-8654-455d-a4ad-7aee88bfa023", "9ce8e4b4-1798-4eaf-a189-2d9e9d25cf8e", "bfce8a65-c13b-4e24-8833-6059a65c3318", "cb083b29-7db2-4c9c-8a25-a68ac524377e", "d0cdbca6-1e24-47c1-a700-0b1437c6d21d", "e1b7ef3c-1d8f-4082-86bf-03c022d4638e", "fab7c251-cc94-492a-b1ad-92b63579688f"], "title": "Compilation of the ELECTRE reactive language into finite transition systems", "venue": "Theoretical Computer Science", "year": 1995, "id": "38acc6f2-cac3-4c85-942f-435c170d1d13"}

{"abstract": "With the advent of next generation sequencing technologies, the cost of sequencing whole genomes is poised to go below $1000 per human individual in a few years As more and more genomes are sequenced, analysis methods are undergoing rapid development, making it tempting to store sequencing data for long periods of time so that the data can be re-analyzed with the latest techniques The challenging open research problems, huge influx of data, and rapidly improving analysis techniques have created the need to store and transfer very large volumes of data.#R##N##R##N#Compression can be achieved at many levels, including trace level (compressing image data), sequence level (compressing a genomic sequence), and fragment-level (compressing a set of short, redundant fragment reads, along with quality-values on the base-calls) We focus on fragment-level compression, which is the pressing need today.#R##N##R##N#Our paper makes two contributions, implemented in a tool, SlimGene First, we introduce a set of domain specific loss-less compression schemes that achieve over 40\u00d7 compression of fragments, outperforming bzip2 by over 6\u00d7 Including quality values, we show a 5\u00d7 compression using less running time than bzip2 Second, given the discrepancy between the compression factor obtained with and without quality values, we initiate the study of using \u2018lossy' quality values Specifically, we show that a lossy quality value quantization results in 14\u00d7 compression but has minimal impact on downstream applications like SNP calling that use the quality values Discrepancies between SNP calls made between the lossy and lossless versions of the data are limited to low coverage areas where even the SNP calls made by the lossless version are marginal.", "authors": ["Christos Kozanitis", "Christopher T.

{"abstract": "This article introduces structural aspects in an ontology of approximate reason. The basic assumption in this ontology is that approximate reason is a capability of an agent. Agents are designed to classify information granules derived from sensors that respond to stimuli in the environment of an agent or received from other agents. Classification of information granules is carried out in the context of parameterized approximation spaces and a calculus of granules. Judgment in agents is a faculty of thinking about (classifying) the particular relative to decision rules derived from data. Judgment in agents is reflective, but not in the classical philosophical sense (e.g., the notion of judgment in Kant). In an agent, a reflective judgment itself is an assertion that a particular decision rule derived from data is applicable to an object (input). That is, a reflective judgment by an agent is an assertion that a particular vector of attribute (sensor) values matches to some degree the conditions for a particular rule. In effect, this form of judgment is an assertion that a vector of sensor values reflects a known property of data expressed by a decision rule. Since the reasoning underlying a reflective judgment is inductive and surjective (not based on a priori conditions or universals), this form of judgment is reflective, but not in the sense of Kant. Unlike Kant, a reflective judgment is surjective in the sense that it maps experimental attribute values onto the most closely matching descriptors (conditions) in a derived rule. Again, unlike Kant's notion of judgment, a reflective judgment is not the result of searching for a universal that pertains to a particular set of values of descriptors. Rather, a reflective judgment by an agent is a form of recognition that a particular vector of sensor values pertains to a particular rule in some degree. This recognition takes the form of an assertion that a particular descriptor vector is associated with a particular decision rule. These considerations can be repeated for other forms of classifiers besides those defined by decision rules.", "authors": ["James F.

{"abstract": "The Semantic Web is a candidate for the next generation of the World Wide Web. It is anticipated that the number of metadata written in RDF (Resource Description Framework) and RDF Schema will increase as the Semantic Web becomes popular. In such a situation, demand for querying metadata described with RDF and RDF Schema will also increase, and therefore effective query retrieval of RDF data is important. To this end, we propose an indexing scheme for RDF and RDF Schema. In our (proposed) scheme, we first extract four kinds of DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) from an RDF data, and extract all path expressions from the DAGs. Then, we generate four kinds of suffix arrays based on the path expressions. Using the indices, we can achieve efficient processing of query retrievals on RDF data including schematic information defined by RDF Schema (for example, classes and/or properties).", "authors": ["Akiyoshi Matono", "Toshiyuki Amagasa", "Masatoshi Yoshikawa", "Shunsuke Uemura"], "n_citation": 32, "references": ["155ee3f0-d9b3-403a-a2b2-343426f4e38d", "31a16042-9d1d-4ff6-a8e6-bf03ab404efb", "63c07eda-b4ff-4d6a-9244-7d4dc829d2ad", "7a20c8c9-ca50-4aaa-81ce-46e489967e02", "84471dc7-45a7-4af1-abf6-975331b95837", "89800fb9-9a1a-4d42-9b9f-7fb10ed9843d", "91b101f8-1d00-4552-9d99-deb22e9f5411", "9278b3df-8c78-4c34-8e80-7dc7bafbdfbf", "e3d3c045-22db-4e00-a895-263d5becef4f", "eb74c6f4-388b-4175-9942-1a8b6e3828f1", "eba404cc-6482-476d-abf3-9948a00823d2", "f988e6ff-ce11-4219-b875-0d5ae5664482"], "title": "An indexing scheme for RDF and RDF schema based on suffix arrays", "venue": "international semantic web conference", "year": 2003, "id": "0935ea30-b537-40fd-9af0-e6e36f1a0f1d"}
{"abstract": "Ensemble methods, which train multiple learners for a task, are among the state-of-the-art learning approaches. The diversity of the component learners has been recognized as a key to a good ensemble, and existing ensemble methods try different ways to encourage diversity, mostly by heuristics. In this paper, we propose the diversity regularized machine (DRM) in a mathematical programming framework, which efficiently generates an ensemble of diverse support vector machines (SVMs). Theoretical analysis discloses that the diversity constraint used in DRM can lead to an effective reduction on its hypothesis space complexity, implying that the diversity control in ensemble methods indeed plays a role of regularization as in popular statistical learning approaches. Experiments show that DRM can significantly improve generalization ability and is superior to some state-of-the-art SVM ensemble methods.", "authors": ["Yang Yu", "Yu-Feng Li", "Zhi-Hua Zhou"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0f115eea-2272-431f-9f21-6d6789b2bbc9", "310cbba4-d88d-4bf4-a4f2-738f91b5f8c8", "3a7a71d7-aa11-4ac9-8e9e-df0fe00753ce", "3ae9664a-bf6f-45d2-852f-bba9b47e2b8a", "6c68311c-2745-446f-9c09-df4632392a78", "6eb90bfa-1819-4db5-aca8-1f0cc2a4f568", "763b691a-5998-46d5-a1ca-d2753a54b49a", "9900fa29-b4d6-4af8-9d6a-587bb6800cd3", "b7c2a37b-4274-46e5-896a-c44479c9a105", "c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846", "c88edc45-936d-4cda-9d12-1a7a21cdb651", "c8a617d5-66fb-4f12-bd3d-cf049da09293", "c8ab79f5-1e71-4dec-aef4-8f54f43be8f7", "db26488d-78be-44b1-a343-e896f43c5d29", "dd5a3ef5-9d44-4dde-bcdb-dc4d17c69073", "ee7d45f5-2a83-4a93-b31c-f1145ca0e906", "f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6", "f98f3e2b-d93b-4c34-bb55-f2acc0cddab6"], "title": "Diversity regularized machine", "venue": "international joint conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2011, "id": "2601d3eb-d752-49d7-932d-8de5033ccbef"}

{"abstract": "In recent years, configuration errors (i.e., misconfigurations) have become one of the dominant causes of system failures, resulting in many severe service outages and downtime. Unfortunately, it is notoriously difficult for system users (e.g., administrators and operators) to prevent, detect, and troubleshoot configuration errors due to the complexity of the configurations as well as the systems under configuration. As a result, the cost of resolving configuration errors is often tremendous from the aspects of both compensating the service disruptions and diagnosing, recovering from the failures. The prevalence, severity, and cost have made configuration errors one of the most thorny system problems that desire to be addressed.   This survey article provides a holistic and structured overview of the systems approaches that tackle configuration errors. To understand the problem fundamentally, we first discuss the characteristics of configuration errors and the challenges of tackling such errors. Then, we discuss the state-of-the-art systems approaches that address different types of configuration errors in different scenarios. Our primary goal is to equip the stakeholder with a better understanding of configuration errors and the potential solutions for resolving configuration errors in the spectrum of system development and management. To inspire follow-up research, we further discuss the open problems with regard to system configuration.

{"abstract": "Recently, there has been an increasing deployment of content distribution networks (CDNs) that offer hosting services to Web content providers. In this paper, we first compare the uncooperative pulling of Web contents used by commercial CDNs with the cooperative pushing. Our results show that the latter can achieve comparable users' perceived performance with only 4%-5% of replication and update traffic compared with the former scheme. Therefore, we explore how to efficiently push content to CDN nodes. Using trace-driven simulation, we show that replicating content in units of URLs can yield 60%-70% reduction in clients' latency, compared with replicating in units of Websites. However, it is very expensive to perform such a fine-grained replication. To address this issue, we propose to replicate content in units of clusters, each containing objects which are likely to be requested by clients that are topologically close. To this end, we describe three clustering techniques and use various topologies and several large Web server traces to evaluate their performance. Our results show that the cluster-based replication achieves performance close to that of the URL-based scheme, but only at 1%-2% of computation and management cost. In addition, by adjusting the number of clusters, we can smoothly trade off management and computation cost for better client performance. To adapt to changes in users' access patterns, we also explore incremental clustering that adaptively adds new documents to the existing content clusters. We examine both offline and online incremental clustering, where the former assumes access history is available while the latter predicts access pattern based on the hyperlink structure. Our results show that the offline clustering yields performance close to that of the complete re-clustering at much lower overhead.

{"abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach for obtaining semantic interoperability among data sources in a bottom-up, semi-automatic manner without relying on pre-existing, global semantic models. We assume that large amounts of data exist that have been organized and annotated according to local schemas. Seeing semantics as a form of agreement, our approach enables the participating data sources to incrementally develop global agreement in an evolutionary and completely decentralized process that solely relies on pair-wise, local interactions: Participants provide translations between schemas they are interested in and can learn about other translations by routing queries (gossiping). To support the participants in assessing the semantic quality of the achieved agreements we develop a formal framework that takes into account both syntactic and semantic criteria. The assessment process is incremental and the quality ratings are adjusted along with the operation of the system. Ultimately, this process results in global agreement, i.e., the semantics that all participants understand. We discuss strategies to efficiently find translations and provide results from a case study to justify our claims. Our approach applies to any system which provides a communication infrastructure (existing websites or databases, decentralized systems, P2P systems) and offers the opportunity to study semantic interoperability as a global phenomenon in a network of information sharing parties.", "authors": ["Karl Aberer", "Philippe Cudr\u00e9-Mauroux", "Manfred Hauswirth"], "n_citation": 234, "references": ["1f7efe61-19b7-4529-b89f-789f9dc1a35e", "3195efb3-c563-4f44-9140-60ec03f84108", "463623d9-06f4-49b9-813f-21f78d726f3b", "57ffaea2-7fcc-4245-b9a9-59cfc77ee358", "5a6f7746-b8b8-44a1-9b61-87bc4ca97cfe", "80f5e1ae-670a-4f3b-8a0d-7cafccc1a0ed", "961c0460-fa77-47be-ba2c-a0de70b5bf4c", "9fd72119-a9ac-43cb-97e5-8b7730dabdab", "b0d313be-bd63-4b35-a3ac-4b1298b6a46f", "bcf8abd7-10e4-4e3e-a9db-a1a0583c0568"], "title": "The chatty web: emergent semantics through gossiping", "venue": "international world wide web conferences", "year": 2003, "id": "12a94a29-c136-4a4b-8efb-72545f74ece1"}

{"abstract": "It has been widely observed that there is no single \"dominant\" SAT solver; instead, different solvers perform best on different instances. Rather than following the traditional approach of choosing the best solver for a given class of instances, we advocate making this decision online on a per-instance basis. Building on previous work, we describe SATzilla, an automated approach for constructing per-instance algorithm portfolios for SAT that use so-called empirical hardness models to choose among their constituent solvers. This approach takes as input a distribution of problem instances and a set of component solvers, and constructs a portfolio optimizing a given objective function (such as mean runtime, percent of instances solved, or score in a competition). The excellent performance of SATzilla was independently verified in the 2007 SAT Competition, where our SATzilla07 solvers won three gold, one silver and one bronze medal. In this article, we go well beyond SATzilla07 by making the portfolio construction scalable and completely automated, and improving it by integrating local search solvers as candidate solvers, by predicting performance score instead of runtime, and by using hierarchical hardness models that take into account different types of SAT instances. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these new techniques in extensive experimental results on data sets including instances from the most recent SAT competition.", "authors": ["Lin Xu", "Frank Hutter", "Holger H.

{"abstract": "In many data mining domains, misclassification costs are different for different examples, in the same way that class membership probabilities are example-dependent. In these domains, both costs and probabilities are unknown for test examples, so both cost estimators and probability estimators must be learned. After discussing how to make optimal decisions given cost and probability estimates, we present decision tree and naive Bayesian learning methods for obtaining well-calibrated probability estimates. We then explain how to obtain unbiased estimators for example-dependent costs, taking into account the difficulty that in general, probabilities and costs are not independent random variables, and the training examples for which costs are known are not representative of all examples. The latter problem is called sample selection bias in econometrics. Our solution to it is based on Nobel prize-winning work due to the economist James Heckman.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of routing traffic to optimize the performance of a congested network. We are given a network, a rate of traffic between each pair of nodes, and a latency function for each edge specifying the time needed to traverse the edge given its congestion; the objective is to route traffic such that the sum of all travel times---the total latency---is minimized.In many settings, it may be expensive or impossible to regulate network traffic so as to implement an optimal assignment of routes. In the absence of regulation by some central authority, we assume that each network user routes its traffic on the minimum-latency path available to it, given the network congestion caused by the other users. In general such a \"selfishly motivated\" assignment of traffic to paths will not minimize the total latency; hence, this lack of regulation carries the cost of decreased network performance.In this article, we quantify the degradation in network performance due to unregulated traffic. We prove that if the latency of each edge is a linear function of its congestion, then the total latency of the routes chosen by selfish network users is at most 4/3 times the minimum possible total latency (subject to the condition that all traffic must be routed). We also consider the more general setting in which edge latency functions are assumed only to be continuous and nondecreasing in the edge congestion. Here, the total latency of the routes chosen by unregulated selfish network users may be arbitrarily larger than the minimum possible total latency; however, we prove that it is no more than the total latency incurred by optimally routing  twice  as much traffic.", "authors": ["Tim Roughgarden", "\u00c9va Tardos"], "n_citation": 1959, "references": ["3543a72d-adf3-4f9c-8c65-a11f36e99da6", "3c68cc29-caca-419b-9396-36c4b6d703e7", "5c3da41e-4ede-45b2-a162-9949028626de", "63f0f592-f649-4343-8d4f-71718072df89", "71a2f5dd-f4c3-4feb-a82d-81c352f0049c", "74923aae-575e-4cf7-bf69-643b9264d55d", "ae385e23-ce38-4d12-90d6-2bbb78b769f9", "ba36ff86-4ae4-4ed9-9165-346749821a5e", "bc208779-e44c-4ed9-a034-ab0035ccfe9d", "dd8095d4-34cf-4a66-9962-2dd37fb016d7"], "title": "How bad is selfish routing", "venue": "Journal of the ACM", "year": 2002, "id": "37a95a01-a4de-4b4d-92a4-b6e837ef9f6b"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, we introduce hyperlink ensembles, a novel type of ensemble classifier for classifying hypertext documents. Instead of using the text on a page for deriving features that can be used for training a classifier, we suggest to use portions of texts from all pages that point to the target page. A hyperlink ensemble is formed by obtaining one prediction for each hyperlink that points to a page.

By partitioning the underlying system state space into regions compatible with a topologically conjugate set of symbolic dynamics, a Petri Net model of the symbolic dynamics is developed for analysis of the reachability properties of the system; finally, a Petri Net-based supervisor is developed for moving the system from one region of the state space to another, illustrating the power of Petri Net-based symbolic dynamic analysis of hybrid systems.", "authors": ["Philippos Peleties", "Raymond A.

{"abstract": "Interorganizational systems are expected to provide opportunities for various stakeholders, often competitors, to collaborate. At the moment, there is a great need for research evidence on the factors facilitating or impeding the achievement of collaborative advantage between interorganizational systems stakeholders. A recent contribution has been the use of a health-information network case to derive lessons for policy makers in this respect. The development and use of the NHSnet in the United Kingdom provides an opportunity to review these lessons in a different context of health-information exchange. Combined with the use of stakeholder analysis, these lessons can enhance our understanding of the context, the stakeholders involved and affected by the network, their interests and their perceptions of collaborative advantage. It, therefore, provides useful insights in the lessons that healthcare policy makers can apply in the development and use of a collaborative network.

{"abstract": "Towards the ultimate goal of seamless interaction among networked programs and devices, industry has developed orchestration and process modeling languages such as XLANG, WSFL, and recently BPEL4WS. Unfortunately, these efforts leave us a long way from seamless interoperation. Researchers in the Semantic Web community have taken up this challenge proposing top-down approaches to achieve aspects of Web Service interoperation. Unfortunately, many of these efforts have been disconnected from emerging industry standards, particularly in process modeling. In this paper we take a bottom-up approach to integrating Semantic Web technology into Web services. Building on BPEL4WS, we present integrated Semantic Web technology for automating customized, dynamic binding of Web services together with interoperation through semantic translation. We discuss the value of semantically enriched service interoperation and demonstrate how our framework accounts for user-defined constraints while gaining potentially successful execution pathways in a practically motivated example. Finally, we provide an analysis of the forward-looking limitations of frameworks like BPEL4WS, and suggest how such specifications might embrace semantic technology at a fundamental level to work towards fully automated Web service interoperation.", "authors": ["Daniel J.

{"abstract": "Implementation of control software on physical systems requires the use of hardware that invariably introduces imprecisions. In particular, the use of an analog-to-digital converter (ADC) introduces uncertainties in measured signals due to sampling and quantization effects. These imprecisions can have a significant effect on the tracking performance of the controller, to the point that it no longer meets the desired targets. This leads to costly design and verification iterations. In this paper, a generic methodology for modeling the uncertainty introduced by sampling and quantization is developed. The resulting values are then propagated through the system's state equations to determine the overall uncertainty bounds on the system model. This methodology is illustrated on the cold-start emission control problem. Verification is performed to ensure that the bounds have been accurately estimated. Finally, a sliding mode controller developed for the cold-start phase of an engine is modified to incorporate these bounds. Simulation on a real engine control unit (ECU) verifies the modified controller is more robust to implementation imprecision.", "authors": ["Kyle Edelberg", "Mahdi Shahbakhti", "J.

These systems are indefinite due to a set of linear constraints on the velocity, causing difficulty for most preconditioners and iterative methods. This paper presents a novel method to obtain a preconditioned linear system from the original one which is then solved by an iterative method. This new method generates a basis for the velocity space and solves a reduced system which is symmetric and positive definite.

{"abstract": "Abstract   In [12] it is shown that the probabilistic powerdomain of a continuous domain is again continuous. The category of continuous domains, however, is not cartesian closed, and one has to look at subcategories such as  RB , the retracts of bifinite domains. [8] offers a proof that the probabilistic powerdomain construction can be restricted to  RB .  In this paper, we give a counterexample to Graham's proof and describe our own attempts at proving a closure result for the probabilistic powerdomain construction. We have positive results for finite trees and finite reversed trees. These illustrate the difficulties we face, rather than being a satisfying answer to the question of whether the probabilistic powerdomain and function spaces can be reconciled.  We are more successful with coherent or Lawson-compact domains. These form a category with many pleasing properties but they fall short of supporting function spaces.  Along the way, we give a new proof of Jones' Splitting Lemma.

{"abstract": "Presents the software framework SMARTSOFT to implement sensorimotor systems. SMARTSOFT not only contains software components to support a modularized implementation but also structural rules and templates. These ensure that the implementation of modules is conforming with an overall multilayer system architecture. Since the provided structures allow the exact specification of the external behavior of modules in terms of interfaces and dependencies, the interaction with a symbolic task execution layer is explicitly supported. SMARTSOFT significantly eases the implementation and integration of new modules into a complex sensorimotor system which for example provides the opportunity even to compare and reuse different modules on a mobile platform.

{"abstract": "Intra prediction with fine directions is a critical feature in the new High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard because it provides significant performance gain. Different from the intra prediction in the H.264/AVC, this approach is more complicated in terms of computation and memory access, which makes the VLSI design very difficult. In this paper, we propose an efficient uniform architecture for all of the 4\u00d74 intra directional modes. The architecture is implemented by a register array and a flexible reference sample selection technique. This novel architecture does not need to project the samples from the side reference to the main reference. Thus, it reduces the processing latency and the number of registers considerably. The proposed architecture has been implemented with TSMC 0.13\u03bcm CMOS technology.

The delay performance under uniform traffic and the hot-spot throughput of DRRM is better than that of iSLIP, while the throughput of iSLIP under some nonuniform traffic scenarios is slightly higher than that of DRRM.

{"abstract": "The article explores the use of Simple Synchrony Networks (SSNs) for learning to parse English sentences drawn from a corpus of naturally occurring text. Parsing natural language sentences requires taking a sequence of words and outputting a hierarchical structure representing how those words fit together to form constituents. Feedforward and simple recurrent networks have had great difficulty with this task, in part because the number of relationships required to specify a structure is too large for the number of unit outputs they have available. SSNs have the representational power to output the necessary O(n/sup 2/) possible structural relationships because SSNs extend the O(n) incremental outputs of simple recurrent networks with the O(n) entity outputs provided by temporal synchrony variable binding. The article presents an incremental representation of constituent structures which allows SSNs to make effective use of both these dimensions. Experiments on learning to parse naturally occurring text show that this output format supports both effective representation and effective generalization in SSNs. To emphasize the importance of this generalization ability, the article also proposes a short-term memory mechanism for retaining a bounded number of constituents during parsing. This mechanism improves the O(n/sup 2/) speed of the basic SSN architecture to linear time, but experiments confirm that the generalization ability of SSN networks is maintained.", "authors": ["Peter C.

AnnoDomini's primary goals have been flexibility (support for multiple year representations), completeness (identifying all potential Year 2000 problems), correctness (correct fixes for Year 2000 problems) and a high degree of safe automation in all phases (declarative specification of conversions, no second-guessing or dangerous heuristics).In this paper we present the type-theoretic foundations of AnnoDomini: type system, type inference, unification theory, semantic soundness, and correctness of conversion.

{"abstract": "Formation of multiple groups of agents is an important issue to generate different geometric patterns and shapes. In this paper, a centroid based transformation (CBT), that captures the constraint relationship among agents, has been introduced for multiple groups of agents, and it decomposes the combined dynamics of double integrator systems into intra group shape dynamics, inter group shape dynamics, and the dynamics of the centroid. Upon application of the transformation, a modular architecture is formed, which gives the flexibility to design separate control laws for intra group, inter group shape variables, and the tracking control of the centroid. A new control law has been proposed such that the overall error dynamics becomes singularly perturbed system. Three time scale convergence of the error dynamics, has been achieved by selecting suitable controller gains, and also order of the system is significantly reduced after the convergence of the intra and inter group shape variables. Negative gradient of a potential based function has been appended to the controller to ensure collision avoidance among the agents. Simulation results has been provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed controller.", "authors": ["Soumic Sarkar", "Indra Narayan Kar"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["0a537289-487d-4835-ada2-c26c10031199", "0cb61dc0-15c5-4592-a5fb-fd76d75f03ac", "11ca9811-268e-4836-bca8-e6e7cd9b8a34", "18081aac-671b-4eb0-ae18-5ae8ffa43f05", "49fa2ddb-bcc1-43d0-b9b6-5feae5d942fb", "4e86ab99-7537-44aa-8446-f256922c934d", "5b9219a3-eb3d-47fa-b65b-558ef5d76d4e", "630fa724-fb58-46c6-a1d0-7b8cced677ca", "641f68ab-3488-4023-8d24-8894a82ee564", "6aee57a5-f5f2-461f-9046-c9caaac34529", "6c140dba-2a0e-4b9f-a079-63fb5b28a3ee", "6f4225ac-a69e-4236-8868-262678fca345", "6fb95cac-2287-4c57-ab14-647b92ebb2ae", "952920e1-bd70-4613-9427-8fb778e139ae", "9ce15202-c6b6-4af9-85c8-7cc2cbb0daa5", "aeabc622-720d-44d0-888c-787e7d377f54", "b64efcf1-5d43-4e9e-a376-bef510b1b77d", "b6a0562d-91b9-4b65-a395-0e705e24f3ba", "baf427ba-2476-4e38-b9b6-c336ed8d7883", "c267034b-d857-4343-939b-a7255b324665", "d9162547-fd7f-4605-855d-0a3173c4b08e"], "title": "Formation control of multiple groups of robots", "venue": "conference on decision and control", "year": 2013, "id": "70058205-ff91-4506-accb-98c86702b90c"}
{"abstract": "Today's mobile applications require constant adaptation to their changing environments, or contexts. Technological advances have increased the pervasiveness of mobile computing devices such as laptops, handhelds, and embedded sensors. The sheer amount of context information available for adaptation places a heightened burden on application developers as they must manage and utilize vast amounts of data from diverse sources. Facilitating programming in this data-rich environment requires a middleware that provides context information to applications in an abstract form. In this paper, we demonstrate the feasibility of such a middleware that allows programmers to focus on high-level interactions among programs and to employ declarative abstract context specifications in settings that exhibit transient interactions with opportunistically encountered components. We also discuss the novel context-aware abstractions the middleware provides and the programming knowledge necessary to write applications using it.

Encirclement is defined as the situation in which a target is isolated and surrounded by a group of UAVs. It is a tactic that can be employed by a team of UAVs to neutralize a target by restricting its movement due to a containment motion near the target while maintaining a formation around it. In this paper, the problem of choosing the correct target to create a dynamic circular formation is considered and a Decentralized Model Predictive Control (DMPC) policy is formulated. From simulation results the derived Model Predictive Control (MPC) policy is effective for the case of two teams of UAVs encircling two stationary targets, and two teams of UAVs encircling two moving targets. The contributions of this paper are the application of MPC to the problem of encirclement, the explicit objective of a dynamic circular formation around the target, and the ability of each team to choose its correct target.", "authors": ["Ahmed T.

{"abstract": "Recent changes in information systems technologies, applications, and personnel require us to reconsider the skills for tomorrow's IS professionals. This study uses data from four groups-IS managers, end-user managers, IS consultants, and IS professors-to identify the key skills and knowledge that will be required of future IS professionals. These requirements were then compared with current IS academic programs. The results reveal that despite a shared vision of the future IS professional, there is an \"expectation gap\" between industry needs and academic preparation. Industry and universities must work together to close this gap. Universities need to place more emphasis on the integration of technologies, applications, data, and business functions and less on traditional and formal system development. Firms need to send consistent messages to universities about their expectations while recognizing that the mission of university business programs is career education, not job training.", "authors": ["Eileen M.

The bit-packed encoding delivers the best compression rates: on average 85% for real life programs. The packed encoding performs type inclusion tests in only 4 machine instructions.

{"abstract": "The emergence of OpenFlow-capable switches enables exciting new network functionality, at the risk of programming errors that make communication less reliable. The centralized programming model, where a single controller program manages the network, seems to reduce the likelihood of bugs. However, the system is inherently distributed and asynchronous, with events happening at different switches and end hosts, and inevitable delays affecting communication with the controller. In this paper, we present efficient, systematic techniques for testing unmodified controller programs. Our NICE tool applies model checking to explore the state space of the entire system--the controller, the switches, and the hosts. Scalability is the main challenge, given the diversity of data packets, the large system state, and the many possible event orderings. To address this, we propose a novel way to augment model checking with symbolic execution of event handlers (to identify representative packets that exercise code paths on the controller). We also present a simplified OpenFlow switch model (to reduce the state space), and effective strategies for generating event interleavings likely to uncover bugs. Our prototype tests Python applications on the popular NOX platform. In testing three real applications--a MAC-learning switch, in-network server load balancing, and energy-efficient traffic engineering--we uncover eleven bugs.", "authors": ["Marco Canini", "Daniele Venzano", "Peter Pere\u0161\u00edni", "Dejan Kostic", "Jennifer Rexford"], "n_citation": 435, "references": ["0d0e4949-478c-465b-bc6e-8bdbde09a843", "10bf7f33-2501-4c43-a0dd-55484e51f19f", "23503259-16b4-43af-baf2-13a85c1c84a1", "252b9e3e-4e30-426b-b4fc-2859b4e5503c", "42886e5f-c873-40e2-a934-08d40144a08c", "5355838e-1178-43c1-b042-f8c62ae44a58", "69b848b7-e4a7-4866-96bd-ad4da31baf1e", "71209296-e207-422b-bb8b-7ebbc2672068", "71c47dd0-a7ff-4b97-a640-1186dd9ac968", "72db976e-5886-4750-a650-0ef209e3a51c", "88a02558-56af-442c-bf55-da220e6756cd", "8fe4002b-d7b7-47dc-a451-cd9012e86eb7", "98e22ff9-3d7f-4377-be70-a0c5861d7346", "abf7f290-5b74-4b9a-9661-a1af46b0083a", "aedefc13-daea-4745-a533-67d304b7d5b6", "bf4d1fd6-f445-41d7-95fc-142167a1f473", "c11379d6-0520-4049-a12f-f2d330571ba9", "dde3dfa5-e2a6-4262-8685-baf1ad01022c", "ea5cbe9b-80cf-456b-a728-1d564a135f05", "f08a3f7d-0eaa-427b-975e-1ab0c2dbc067", "f48cba4a-52da-4183-81f8-f4b74ceb875f", "f7e3efab-4e70-466d-99c8-de98fdff01df", "fd43ff1a-8079-4041-977d-d27b1b3efd3f", "ffed5767-3cb9-4f34-8bcc-a1425ade9fce"], "title": "A NICE way to test openflow applications", "venue": "networked systems design and implementation", "year": 2012, "id": "3d22dcea-2664-4f72-8c51-39c2ba1ea9f9"}

This paper describes an architecture which deals with complex\u2014 high-dimensional and/or continuous\u2014situation and action spaces effectively. This architecture is based on two main ideas. The first is to organize the reactive component into a set of modules in such a way that, roughly, each one of them codifies the prototypical action for a given cluster of situations. The second idea is to use a particular kind of planning for figuring out what part of the action space deserves attention for each cluster of situations. Salient features of the planning process are that it is grounded and that it is invoked only when the reactive component does not generalize correctly its previous experience to the new situation.

{"abstract": "To protect computation, a security architecture must safeguard not only the software that performs it but also the state on which the software operates. This requires more than just preserving state confidentiality and integrity, since, e.g., software may err if its state is rolled back to a correct but stale version. For this reason, we present Memoir, the first system that fully ensures the continuity of a protected software module's state. In other words, it ensures that a module's state remains persistently and completely inviolate. A key contribution of Memoir is a technique to ensure rollback resistance without making the system vulnerable to system crashes. It does this by using a deterministic module, storing a concise summary of the module's request history in protected NVRAM, and allowing only safe request replays after crashes. Since frequent NVRAM writes are impractical on modern hardware, we present a novel way to leverage limited trusted hardware to minimize such writes. To ensure the correctness of our design, we develop formal, machine-verified proofs of safety. To demonstrate Memoir's practicality, we have built it and conducted evaluations demonstrating that it achieves reasonable performance on real hardware.

{"abstract": "The most important issue when parallelizing sequential programs is the efficient assignment of computations into different processing elements. The most extensive, in terms of time execution, part of a program is the nested loops. Too many approaches have been devoted in parallelizing nested loops, and assigning the concurrent partitions of such a loop into different processors. In the past, all methods have been focused upon linear schedules produced by manipulating the reduced dependence graph, which in some cases achieve near optimal solutions. This paper presents a new method of free scheduling loop computations into time, based on task graph scheduling techniques. It will be shown that this schedule is optimal in terms of time, outperforming all linear schedules. Furthermore, in terms of total number of processors, the presented method includes a heuristic refinement of the free schedule which 'shuffles' computations into time, without loss of the optimal time performance, to augment the mean processor utilization. In all cases, the proposed method uses less number of processors, while preserving the optimal total execution time. The 'shuffling' of computations is based on graph theory approaches, and uses PERT problem techniques. Such scheduling is convenient for parallelizing tools (such as compilers), but has practical interest for shared memory multiprocessor systems, where the communication delay imposed by such non-regular scheduling is of no interest.", "authors": ["Nectarios Koziris", "George K.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a constructive model by which a robot acquires the ability of joint attention with a human caregiver based on its embedded mechanisms of visual attention and learning with self-evaluation. The former is to look at a salient object in the robot's view, and the latter is to learn sensorimotor co-ordination when visual attention has succeeded. Since the success of visual attention does not always correspond to the success of joint attention, the robot has incorrect learning data for joint attention as well as correct data. However, the robot is expected statistically to lose incorrect data as outliers since such data do not have any correlation in the sensorimotor co-ordination while correct data have a correlation. The robot consequently acquires the ability of joint attention by finding the correlation in the sensorimotor co-ordination even if multiple objects are placed at random positions in an environment and a human caregiver does not provide any task evaluation to the robot. The experimental results show that the proposed model makes the robot reproduce the developmental process of infants' joint attention. Therefore, the proposed model could be one of the models to explain how infants develop the ability of joint attention.", "authors": ["Yukie Nagai", "Koh Hosoda", "Akio Morita", "Minoru Asada"], "n_citation": 197, "references": ["1b7cee60-99ba-4df3-93f1-24d44ac3e7f4", "21b81eda-3e15-4a5e-972c-7f0362fcc571", "587805f8-20f4-4c81-be71-71bba09482e4", "79f81a4e-fd6e-4820-8a9b-c534b2da5a1d", "b3092248-f7f4-465f-89f3-53a692c5be9f", "b81260c4-f236-4752-9280-ab11455bddf2"], "title": "A constructive model for the development of joint attention", "venue": "Connection Science", "year": 2003, "id": "2bb1b0b8-ff42-40f3-b3cd-df55a2c43343"}
{"abstract": "In philosophy, Ontology is the basic description of things in the world. In information science, an ontology refers to an engineering artifact, constituted by a specific vocabulary used to describe a certain reality. Ontologies have been proposed for validating both conceptual models and conceptual schemas. However, these roles are quite dissimilar. In this paper, we will show that ontologies can be better understood if we classify the different uses of the term as it appears in the literature. First we explain Ontology (with a capital O) as used in Philosophy. Then, we propose a differentiation between ontologies of information systems from ontologies for information systems. All three concepts have an important role in information science. We clarify the different meanings and uses of Ontology and ontologies through a comparison of the research by Wand & Weber and by Guarino in ontology-driven information systems. The contributions of this paper are twofold. First, it provides a better understanding of what ontologies are. Second, it explains the double role of ontologies in information science research.", "authors": ["Frederico T.

What sensing and actuation abilities are needed to complete a given task? Are some robot systems provably \"more powerful\", in terms of the tasks that they can complete, than others? Can we find meaningful equivalence classes of robot systems? This line of research is inspired by the theory of computation, which has produced similar results for abstract computing machines. Our basic contribution is a dominance relation over robot systems that formalizes the idea that some robots are stronger than others. This comparison, which is based on how the robots progress through their information spaces, induces a partial order over the set of robot systems.

In the absence of rate limits, we offer necessary and sufficient conditions for the generation g(t) to service the loads under causal scheduling without surplus or deficit. Our results show that the flexibility in the collection can be modeled as electricity storage. The capacity Q(t) and maximum charge/discharge rate m(t) of the equivalent storage can be computed in real time. Ex ante, these parameters must be estimated based on arrival/departure statistics and charging needs. Thus, the collection is equivalent a stochastic time-varying electricity storage.

{"abstract": "In this paper, a new formulation for the optimal tracking control problem (OTCP) of continuous-time nonlinear systems is presented. This formulation extends the integral reinforcement learning (IRL) technique, a method for solving optimal regulation problems, to learn the solution to the OTCP. Unlike existing solutions to the OTCP, the proposed method does not need to have or to identify knowledge of the system drift dynamics, and it also takes into account the input constraints a priori. An augmented system composed of the error system dynamics and the command generator dynamics is used to introduce a new nonquadratic discounted performance function for the OTCP. This encodes the input constrains into the optimization problem. A tracking Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation associated with this nonquadratic performance function is derived which gives the optimal control solution. An online IRL algorithm is presented to learn the solution to the tracking HJB equation without knowing the system drift dynamics. Convergence to a near-optimal control solution and stability of the whole system are shown under a persistence of excitation condition.

{"abstract": "Recent advances in educational technologies and the wide-spread use of computers in schools have fueled innovations in test construction and analysis. As the measurement accuracy of a test depends on the quality of the items it includes, item selection procedures play a central role in this process. Mathematical programming and the item response theory (IRT) are often used in automating this task. However, when the item bank is very large, the number of item combinations increases exponentially and item selection becomes more tedious. To alleviate the computational complexity, researchers have previously applied heuristic search and machine learning approaches, including neural networks, to solve similar problems. This paper proposes a novel approach that uses abductive network modeling to automatically identify the most-informative subset of test items that can be used to effectively assess the examinees without seriously degrading accuracy. Abductive machine learning automatically selects only effective model inputs and builds an optimal network model of polynomial functional nodes that minimizes a predicted squared error criterion. Using a training dataset of 1500 cases (examinees) and 45 test items, the proposed approach automatically selected only 12 items which classified an evaluation population of 500 cases with 91% accuracy. Performance is examined for various levels of model complexity and compared with that of statistical IRT-based techniques. Results indicate that the proposed approach significantly reduces the number of test items required while maintaining acceptable test quality.", "authors": ["El-Sayed M. El-Alfy", "R.E.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a new motion generation technique, called motion path synthesis. The objective is to generate a motion for an intelligent avatar to move along a planned route using a pre-existing motion library. First, motion primitives, each defined as a dynamic motion segment, are extracted from the motion library. Then a motion graph is constructed based on the motion primitives and their connectivities. Within this motion graph, the desired realistic motion for avatars can be synthesized through a two-stage process: search an optimal motion path within the motion graph, joint the motion path and adapt it to the route.

{"abstract": "Given that the Internet does not widely support Internet protocol multicast while content-distribution-network technologies are costly, the concept of peer-to-peer could be a promising start for enabling large-scale streaming systems. In our so-called Zigzag approach, we propose a method for clustering peers into a hierarchy called the administrative organization for easy management, and a method for building the multicast tree atop this hierarchy for efficient content transmission. In Zigzag, the multicast tree has a height logarithmic with the number of clients, and a node degree bounded by a constant. This helps reduce the number of processing hops on the delivery path to a client while avoiding network bottlenecks. Consequently, the end-to-end delay is kept small. Although one could build a tree satisfying such properties easily, an efficient control protocol between the nodes must be in place to maintain the tree under the effects of network dynamics. Zigzag handles such situations gracefully, requiring a constant amortized worst-case control overhead. Especially, failure recovery is done regionally with impact on, at most, a constant number of existing clients and with mostly no burden on the server.", "authors": ["Duc A. Tran", "Kien A.

{"abstract": "A desired signal corrupted by additive noise can often be recovered by an adaptive noise canceller using the least mean squares (LMS) algorithm. A major disadvantage of the LMS algorithm is its excess mean-squared error, or misadjustment, which increases linearly with the desired signal power, This leads to degrading performance when the desired signal exhibits large power fluctuations and is a serious problem in many speech processing applications. This work considers two modified LMS algorithms, the weighted sum and sum methods, designed to solve this problem by reducing the size of the steps in the weight update equation when the desired signal is strong. The weighted sum method is derived from an optimal method (also developed in this work), which is not generally applicable because it requires quantities unavailable in a practical system. The previously proposed, but ad hoc, sum method is analyzed and compared to the weighted sum method. Analysis of the two modified LMS algorithms indicates that either one provides substantial improvements in the presence of strong desired signals and similar performance in the presence of weak desired signals, relative to the unmodified LMS algorithm. Computer simulations with both uncorrelated Gaussian noise and speech signals confirm the results of the analysis and demonstrate the effectiveness of the modified algorithms. The modified LMS algorithms are particularly suited for signals (such as speech) that exhibit large fluctuations in short-time power levels.", "authors": ["Julie E.

{"abstract": "We propose a novel framework for location detection with sensor networks, based on the theory of identifying codes. The key idea of this approach is to allow sensor coverage areas to overlap so that each resolvable position is covered by a unique set of sensors. In this setting, determining a sensor-placement with a minimum number of sensors is equivalent to constructing an optimal identifying code, an NP-complete problem in general. We, thus, propose and analyze new polynomial-time algorithms for generating irreducible (but not necessarily optimal) codes for arbitrary topologies. Our algorithms incorporate robustness properties that are critically needed in harsh environments. We further introduce distributed versions of these algorithms, allowing sensors to self-organize and determine a (robust) identifying code without any central coordination. Through analysis and simulation, we show that our algorithms produce nearly optimal solutions for a wide range of parameters. In addition, we demonstrate a tradeoff between system robustness and the number of active sensors (which is related to the expected lifetime of the system).

On the other hand, we describe the dynamic of architecture in terms of graph-rewriting rules. The obtained rules take into account structural and functional constraints of the system under their application conditions ensuring in this way its consistency during its evolution. We express the rules entirely with the Z notation also obtaining, in this way, a unified approach which treats the static as well as the dynamic aspect.

We approach the problem by rewriting queries on views into equivalent queries on the underlying document, and thus avoid the overhead of view materialization and maintenance. We consider possibly recursively defined XML views and study the rewriting of both XPath and regular XPath queries. We show that while rewriting is not always possible for XPath over recursive views, it is for regular XPath; however, the rewritten query may be of exponential size. To avoid this prohibitive cost we propose a rewriting algorithm that characterizes rewritten queries as a new form of automata, and an efficient algorithm to evaluate the automaton-represented queries.

This article reviews the systems as separate technologies, and then combines them to propose a hybrid solution that draws out their respective advantages. The first part focuses on SUNs and describes the SUN usage model with typical application requirements and practical examples, followed by the latest developments in standardization initiatives with emphasis on the currently active IEEE 802.15.4g and 802.11ah groups. The second part discusses TVWS, studying and summarizing the regulations governing its usage, and then reports on the standardization bodies' responses to these regulations with a focus on IEEE 802.11af, 802.19.1, and 802.22. Finally, the third part amalgamates the SUN usage model with TVWS regulations and deployment scenarios, providing relationship mapping between the SUN components and regulation-compliant TVWS devices.

{"abstract": "Visual tracking using active contours is usually accomplished in a static framework. The active contour tracks the object of interest in a given frame of an image sequence, and then a subsequent prediction step ensures good initial placement for the next frame. This approach is unnatural, the curve evolution gets decoupled from the actual dynamics of the objects to be tracked. True dynamic approaches exist, all being marker particle based, and thus prone to the shortcomings of such particle-based implementations. In particular, topological changes are not handled naturally in this framework. The now \"classical\" level set approach is tailored for codimension one evolutions. However, dynamic curve evolution is at least of codimension two. We propose a natural, efficient, level set based approach for dynamic curve evolution which removes the artificial separation of segmentation and prediction, while retaining all the desirable properties of level set formulations.

Version consistency ensures that distributed transactions be served as if there were operating on a single coherent version of the system despite possible reconfigurations that may happen meanwhile. The paper also proposes a distributed algorithm to maintain dynamic dependences between components at architectural level and enable low-disruptive version-consistent dynamic reconfigurations. An initial assessment through simulation shows the benefits of the proposed approach with respect to timeliness and low degree of disruption.", "authors": ["Xiaoxing Ma", "Luciano Baresi", "Carlo Ghezzi", "Valerio Panzica La Manna", "Jian Lu"], "n_citation": 58, "references": ["00199e54-1891-4e79-b6e5-ca2b631753d4", "0468472d-d16a-4521-b0e0-008e92fef477", "10fcc683-8c95-4095-a8a8-5891edd7dad6", "1e59cf17-d14e-4627-9ba4-2ecfdef03340", "2a3f2e10-b954-49e1-801d-84815950af01", "40d5d62c-353e-408b-8256-2c59128ca519", "47d0e8d9-79e9-4584-bffb-35937bcd29d3", "499f295d-d7b5-4c4a-b247-acd89c3890dc", "4ace1a86-709b-41ea-b752-02d72b59c0c1", "50f081b0-9cb5-4e31-9121-7114e7ab69b1", "68e59ba1-fa2c-431c-a50f-0abb8fd3bd9d", "84595dd0-d4de-462a-8f18-f4fb89498440", "89190f05-c011-4676-ad8f-5e8a1f5f6553", "89e5da12-2af6-4610-8180-a22cb5f69182", "a0fc34f7-60ae-46b9-8997-0d8b33dfd170", "a2623044-96c9-4027-814a-9561ba1aece5", "ae0f978a-80f3-4703-8e79-52e87e531a4f", "c59d9b37-cb86-407e-b1b0-10794a4cb1ed", "c7e6151c-ee10-4e66-a997-a053bf1e663c", "d18d8bdb-a283-4794-ab86-9d243b4c1448", "e185dfe9-addf-4279-bd79-e38fb73045c4", "e92fbe48-51ff-4dd8-8fc2-886c08a3a529", "f268fbed-889a-4514-83ef-b5f78b738d2a", "f85d1d2f-eb1a-4d45-830f-5ae9b9d96931"], "title": "Version-consistent dynamic reconfiguration of component-based distributed systems", "venue": "foundations of software engineering", "year": 2011, "id": "cb53e2e6-b861-4f57-8ed6-125b3734a77a"}
{"abstract": "The aggressive optimization of floating-point computations is an important problem in high-performance computing. Unfortunately, floating-point instruction sets have complicated semantics that often force compilers to preserve programs as written. We present a method that treats floating-point optimization as a stochastic search problem. We demonstrate the ability to generate reduced precision implementations of Intel's handwritten C numeric library which are up to 6 times faster than the original code, and achieve end-to-end speedups of over 30% on a direct numeric simulation and a ray tracer by optimizing kernels that can tolerate a loss of precision while still remaining correct. Because these optimizations are mostly not amenable to formal verification using the current state of the art, we present a stochastic search technique for characterizing maximum error.

The vehicle trajectories are described using the planar Frenet\u2013Serret equations of motion, which capture the evolution of both the vehicle position and orientation for unit-speed motion subject to curvature (steering) control. The set of all possible (relative) equilibria for arbitrary  G -invariant curvature controls is described (where  G = SE (2) is a symmetry group for the control law), and a global convergence result for the two-vehicle control law is proved. An  n -vehicle generalization of the two-vehicle control law is also presented, and the corresponding (relative) equilibria for the  n -vehicle problem are characterized.

{"abstract": "Generic programming using the C++ template facility has been a successful method for creating high-performance, yet general algorithms for scientific computing and visualization. However, adding template code tends to require more template code in surrounding structures and algorithms to maintain generality. Compiling all possible expansions of these templates can lead to massive template bloat. Furthermore, compile-time binding of templates requires that all possible permutations be known at compile time, limiting the runtime extensibility of the generic code. We present a method for deferring the compilation of these templates until an exact type is needed. This dynamic compilation mechanism will produce the minimum amount of compiled code needed for a particular application, while maintaining the generality and performance that templates innately provide. Through a small amount of supporting code within each templated class, the proper templated code can be generated at runtime without modifying the compiler.

In recent years, formal verification techniques such as [5] have gained popularity in checking a property in all possible behaviors of a system.

Such an abstraction process is unreliable, difficult and miss a lot of implementation errors.CMC is a framework for model checking a broad class of software written in the C programming language. CMC runs the software implementation directly without deriving an abstract model of the code. We used CMC to model check an existing implementation of AODV (Ad Hoc On Demand Distance Vector) routing protocol and found a total of 29 bugs in two implementations [7],[6] of the protocol. One of them is a bug in the actual specification of the AODV protocol [3].

The paper illustrates the use of AOP technologies through the construction and evaluation of a real-time quality of service (QoS) filter regulating the QoS at the receiver-side of a multimedia system over the Internet.

{"abstract": "The evaluation of interactive adaptive systems has long been acknowledged to be a complicated and demanding endeavour. Some promising approaches in the recent past have attempted tackling the problem of evaluating adaptivity by \"decomposing\" and evaluating it in a \"piece-wise\" manner. Separating the evaluation of different aspects can help to identify problems in the adaptation process. This paper presents a framework that can be used to guide the \"layered\" evaluation of adaptive systems, and a set of formative methods that have been tailored or specially developed for the evaluation of adaptivity. The proposed framework unifies previous approaches in the literature and has already been used, in various guises, in recent research work. The presented methods are related to the layers in the framework and the stages in the development lifecycle of interactive systems.

{"abstract": "Wind resources tend to be significantly stronger and more consistent with increasing altitude. This effect creates a potential for power generation that can be reaped by an Airborne Wind Energy system positioned at elevations exceeding the height of conventional wind turbines. A frequent design for such a system includes a flying airfoil tethered to a ground station. The station can be equipped with a power generator or for the application considered here mounted to a sea vessel. We demonstrate a data based method that can maximize the towing force of such a system by optimizing a low level tracking controller at the presence of constraints. We utilise Gaussian Processes to learn the mapping from the set points of the controller to both the objective and the constraint function.We then formulate a chance - constrained optimization problem that takes into consideration uncertainty in the learned functions. The probabilistic objective function is transformed into a deterministic acquisition function which indicates set points with high probability of improving the current optimum and the constraint function is penalized in regions of high uncertainty to ensure feasibility. Simulation studies show that we can find optimal set points for the controller without the use of significant assumptions on model dynamics while respecting the unknown constraint function.", "authors": ["Sanket Sanjay Diwale", "Ioannis Lymperopoulos", "Colin Neil Jones"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["2e0f0fb4-7d92-4180-a1af-d3ead29845a1", "3c2dd6af-0684-4fe6-b3a3-e06a245fbbe2", "74998f12-18aa-4d2e-8ede-3f1e809184c3", "8599ed67-aa9a-4d61-a6a0-5321b38a9084", "b9b789ba-c6e7-468c-a48b-a9aae7c12151"], "title": "Optimization of an Airborne Wind Energy system using constrained Gaussian Processes", "venue": "", "year": 2014, "id": "c675f58e-9186-43ac-b2a5-a9f85e956ff2"}
{"abstract": "Motivated by the phenomenal growth of the Internet in recent years, a number of cable operators are in the process of upgrading their cable networks to offer data services to residential subscribers, providing them direct access to a variety of community content as well as to the Internet. Using cable modems that implement sophisticated modulation-demodulation circuitry, these services promise to offer a several hundredfold increase in access speeds to the home compared to conventional telephone modems. Initial experiences indicate that cable networks are susceptible to a variety of radio-frequency (RF) impairments that can result in significant packet loss during data communication. In the face of such losses, the transmission control protocol (TCP) that is predominantly used by data applications degrades dramatically in performance. Consequently, subscribers of broad-band data services may not perceive the projected hundredfold increase in performance. We analyze the performance of TCP under different network conditions using simulations and propose simple modifications that can offer up to threefold increase in performance in access networks that are prone to losses. These modifications require only minor changes to TCP implementations at the local network servers alone (and not at subscribers' PCs).", "authors": ["Reuven Cohen", "Srinivas Ramanathan"], "n_citation": 58, "references": ["12aa9206-d296-429b-aeae-5e432e9923b6", "4aec5b0c-fb74-45c2-acf0-d02734f5b1e0", "553db688-bb98-4ed0-a2a4-42f1e5678559", "987bf791-88f9-42d5-92af-894882950016", "a6dd809f-733d-4b9a-ae96-d97d4a7ce17d"], "title": "TCP for high performance in hybrid fiber coaxial broad-band access networks", "venue": "IEEE\\/ACM Transactions on Networking", "year": 1998, "id": "6b88dd1e-865a-4a6c-8cc5-4b5c1c588945"}
{"abstract": "Automatically annotating concepts for video is a key to semantic-level video browsing, search and navigation. The research on this topic evolved through two paradigms. The first paradigm used binary classification to detect each individual concept in a concept set. It achieved only limited success, as it did not model the inherent correlation between concepts, e.g., urban and building. The second paradigm added a second step on top of the individual concept detectors to fuse multiple concepts. However, its performance varies because the errors incurred in the first detection step can propagate to the second fusion step and therefore degrade the overall performance. To address the above issues, we propose a third paradigm which simultaneously classifies concepts and models correlations between them in a single step by using a novel  Correlative Multi-Label  (CML) framework. We compare the performance between our proposed approach and the state-of-the-art approaches in the first and second paradigms on the widely used TRECVID data set.

{"abstract": "Credit scoring has become a very important task as the credit industry has been experiencing double-digit growth rate during the past few decades. The artificial neural network is becoming a very popular alternative in credit scoring models due to its associated memory characteristic and generalization capability. However, the decision of network's topology, importance of potential input variables and the long training process has often long been criticized and hence limited its application in handling credit scoring problems. The objective of the proposed study is to explore the performance of credit scoring by integrating the backpropagation neural networks with traditional discriminant analysis approach. To demonstrate the inclusion of the credit scoring result from discriminant analysis would simplify the network structure and improve the credit scoring accuracy of the designed neural network model, credit scoring tasks are performed on one bank credit card data set. As the results reveal, the proposed hybrid approach converges much faster than the conventional neural networks model. Moreover, the credit scoring accuracies increase in terms of the proposed methodology and outperform traditional discriminant analysis and logistic regression approaches.", "authors": ["Tian-Shyug Lee", "Chih-Chou Chiu", "Chi-Jie Lu", "I-Fei Chen"], "n_citation": 168, "references": ["1a642cf3-caad-4cc2-ae3d-82f46013a0be", "8d7bb750-adbb-4a71-813f-09fdfab8f7d0", "8dfb6289-4b20-4110-92e8-2f4cf337f9c9", "97f86b89-5f38-4d96-8172-082166b0c089", "bf2f583b-e473-4ab6-a6cf-583df2a92ef2", "c150df92-9e04-45b8-b03a-31a966181654", "da5201de-e4e1-4db7-831d-fef2448e0c98", "df5f9e37-5746-482d-838b-af6dfa6c283f", "f7eb06b6-0d9b-4401-8918-94be0ddc32bb", "fc97d9f2-31d2-4dad-85a4-f29ab1b507aa"], "title": "CREDIT SCORING USING THE HYBRID NEURAL DISCRIMINANT TECHNIQUE", "venue": "Expert Systems With Applications", "year": 2002, "id": "3eea0a22-6761-4ed2-bc79-ee2c51ef0491"}
{"abstract": "The usual way of installing a new version of a software system is to shut down the running program and then install the new version. This necessitates a sometimes unacceptable delay during which service is denied to the users of the software.

While a number of implementations of online version change systems have been described in the literature, little investigation has been done on its theoretical aspects.

{"abstract": "Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are becoming fundamental components of modern control systems due to their flexibility, ease of deployment and low cost. However, the energy-constrained nature of WSNs poses new issues in control design; in particular the discharge of batteries of sensor nodes, which is mainly due to radio communications, must be taken into account. In this paper we present a novel transmission strategy for communication between controller and sensors which is intended to minimize the data exchange over the wireless channel. Moreover, we propose an energy-aware control technique for constrained linear systems based on explicit model predictive control (MPC), providing closed-loop stability in the presence of disturbances. The presented control schemes are compared to traditional MPC techniques. The results show the effectiveness of the proposed energy-aware approach, which achieves a profitable trade-off between energy savings and closed-loop performance.", "authors": ["Daniele Bernardini", "Alberto Bemporad"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0fd16dd6-e312-4c61-aae8-ab8c3f8bb026", "12590608-3f82-4463-bd7a-5bd19a4d45e1", "1a780ba7-4d18-4232-88dd-2d27b62fdea4", "1c1c46a9-9b83-4279-bb05-e98c7476cc2e", "2c02f701-f2f4-40f8-b005-419d93de581e", "2d6b3f9d-5cfe-42ee-8e8a-52020a02e994", "2fab7e9f-8296-4ebe-90b7-a2cb69c0552b", "39875331-5205-4798-a572-e93e6202b9e7", "3c24e98a-ef68-4e47-bb92-09ec0991ea0a", "516edae0-68d2-4c08-a1d2-be7432ea895e", "8286fd7b-b8b6-432e-96c4-bb0680ad00b1", "94f1695c-b971-4fef-996c-e0929d2cda09", "a58b4fcd-2cf9-4722-995e-fead9cbb2bca"], "title": "Energy-aware robust model predictive control based on noisy wireless sensors", "venue": "Automatica", "year": 2012, "id": "5ce16ea6-9c1e-4418-9caf-26fd86dbaaba"}

Ellipsoids are then used to fit the reconstructed data. By using a simple and user-friendly interface, the user can display and observe, in real time and from any view-point, the 3D models of the moving human body.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a quadratic programming (QP) approach to robust model predictive control (MPC) for constrained linear systems having both model uncertainties and bounded disturbances. To this end, we construct an additional comparison model for worst-case analysis based on a robust control Lyapunov function (RCLF) for the unconstrained system (not necessarily an RCLF in the presence of constraints). This comparison model enables us to transform the given robust MPC problem into a nominal one without uncertain terms. Based on a terminal constraint obtained from the comparison model, we derive a condition for initial states under which the ultimate boundedness of the closed loop is guaranteed without violating state and control constraints. Since this terminal condition is described by linear constraints, the control optimization can be reduced to a QP problem.", "authors": ["Hiroaki Fukushima", "Robert R.

{"abstract": "Methods in object-oriented concurrent libraries hide internal synchronization details. However, information hiding may result in clients causing thread safety violations by invoking methods in an unsafe manner. Given such a library, we present a technique for inferring interface contracts that specify permissible concurrent method calls and patterns of aliasing among method arguments, such that the derived contracts guarantee deadlock free execution for the methods in the library. The contracts also help client developers by documenting required assumptions about the library methods. Alternatively, the contracts can be statically enforced in the client code to detect potential deadlocks in the client. Our technique combines static analysis with a symbolic encoding for tracking lock dependencies, allowing us to synthesize contracts using a SMT solver. Our prototype tool analyzes over a million lines of code for some widely-used Java libraries within an hour, thus demonstrating its scalability and efficiency. Furthermore, the contracts inferred by our approach have been able to pinpoint real deadlocks in clients, i.e. deadlocks that have been a part of bug-reports filed by users and developers of the client code.", "authors": ["Jyotirmoy V.

{"abstract": "Alien noise in the vectored very-high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) system is part of the additive noise at the receiver and exhibits strong correlation among users. We present a per-tone co-operative alien noise cancellation (CoMAC) algorithm for the upstream (US) VDSL that can be applied subsequent to any self far-end-crosstalk (FEXT) mitigation strategy. CoMAC operates by predicting the noise seen by a given user based on the error samples from the remaining users. These errors are conveniently obtained after slicing the self-FEXT canceled signal of all the vectored users. We show that if the estimation of these errors is accurate, the proposed alien canceler achieves the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB). In practice, the seamless rate adaptation (SRA) operation, which enables increased bit rate by increasing the bit-loading per-tone, can cause decision errors in any decision directed strategy. We also analyze the impact of these decision errors - an issue not addressed in the literature. We propose a strategy for bit-loading during the SRA operation by formulating a max-min optimization problem and demonstrate a possibility of a guaranteed (minimum) improvement in the per-user rate. Simulations indicate that performance of the algorithm can exceed the minimum value significantly in practical situations.", "authors": ["Pravesh Biyani", "Amitkumar Mahadevan", "Shankar Prakriya", "Patrick Duvaut", "Surendra Prasad"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["36f07b49-9570-4cad-8083-7fde920cdf42", "38a8ce62-a0e0-4ce1-b2ac-cb16dbc1d4dc", "52e3db83-2346-481d-ae68-c5c23fd8d134", "6c1dbb3a-0c25-433b-93e5-4fbf34c82e0c", "a43356d1-3e3c-4a53-93ba-beb611c0759e", "c9d61755-8c5f-4239-81c6-636aa1715fed", "d10e1676-1678-41f2-b984-844fa8dc42f8", "fb533e77-b204-459b-9724-b9ec2b2e7f57"], "title": "Co-operative Alien Noise Cancellation in Upstream VDSL: A New Decision Directed Approach", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Communications", "year": 2013, "id": "06c28410-666d-49d1-8014-4675840a3b30"}

This issue is of central interest because perplexity optimization can be done independent of a recognizer and in most cases it is possible to find simple perplexity optimization procedures. Moreover, many tasks in language model training such as the optimization of word classes may use perplexity as target function resulting in explicit optimization formulas which are not available if error rates are used as target. This paper first presents some theoretical arguments for a close relationship between perplexity and word error rate. Thereafter the notion of uncertainty of a measurement is introduced and is then used to test the hypothesis that word error rate and perplexity are correlated by a power law.

Recently, this problem has attracted a great deal of interest and several approaches have been proposed. Since Mobile Social Networks (MSNs) are increasingly popular type of Delay Tolerant Networks (DTNs), making accurate analysis of social network properties of these networks is essential for designing efficient routing protocols. In this paper, we introduce a new metric that detects the quality of friendships between nodes accurately. Utilizing this metric, we define the community of each node as the set of nodes having close friendship relations with this node either directly or indirectly. We also present Friendship-Based Routing in which periodically differentiated friendship relations are used in forwarding of messages.

{"abstract": "Memory Wall is a well-known obstacle to processor performance improvement. The popularity of multi-core architecture will further exaggerate the problem since the memory resource is shared by all cores. Interferences among requests from different cores may prolong the latency of memory accesses thereby degrading the system performance. To tackle the problem, this paper proposes to decouple application threads into compute and memory tasks, and restrict the number of concurrent memory tasks to avoid the interference among memory requests. Yet with this scheduling restriction, a CPU core may unnecessarily stay idle, which incurs adverse impact on the overall performance. Therefore, we develop a memory thread throttling mechanism that tunes the allowable memory threads dynamically under workload variation to improve system performance. The proposed run-time mechanism monitors memory and computation ratios of a program for phase detection. It then decides the memory thread constraint for the next program phase based on an analytical model that can estimate system performance under different constraint values. To prove the concept, we prototype the mechanism in some real-world applications as well as synthetic workloads. We evaluate their performance on real machines. The experimental results demonstrate up to 20% speedup with a pool of synthetic workloads on an Intel i7 (Nehalem) machine and match with the speedup estimated by the proposed analytical model. Furthermore, the intelligent run-time scheduling leads to a geometric mean of 12% performance improvement for real-world applications on the same hardware.", "authors": ["Hsiang-Yun Cheng", "Chung-Hsiang Lin", "Jian Li", "Chia-Lin Yang"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["08f93e66-54ba-4cd1-9224-730024fe01b0", "11c43932-d4f7-4acf-9d41-360ad89feb29", "2d493f24-7505-43f2-8849-0e7eedafa1e0", "6a1a8ed5-284a-4bc8-94b0-fa99a12f15ec", "7169d097-a1a1-46d5-b40d-76dce80aca65", "74e63c65-5686-43a2-a632-fff0215dc40b", "818bffac-b155-4710-8b09-19f779e24e3b", "8482384c-b056-4d6b-910c-5fde8d322c3a", "88edc0ae-bd76-43ed-b6d2-2557d98bb5f5", "96ff09f7-e819-4de9-aaf8-9eac2f5fa751", "af4cc774-cab4-4888-9bcf-f29449a58e56", "b53f3b31-5169-4863-a533-eeaaec7480b4", "b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b", "ba46f03c-0144-44ae-871a-f4a925fa405f", "cd92960a-70b6-4309-99bb-8f6d3ee3bdd8", "e06a002b-7783-498d-96f1-ef860345bccc", "e2573bdb-3f20-499f-b915-c48a5e199521", "f5f536af-5e27-4e1c-b838-456f07de9dcd", "f767bdfb-20bb-4071-a0cc-b42c91b86331", "f7e7ca9d-467f-448e-aa99-2dfd4935a8ed", "fb425c21-eba3-4d58-b307-147129720f78"], "title": "Memory Latency Reduction via Thread Throttling", "venue": "international symposium on microarchitecture", "year": 2010, "id": "6762c9ab-7121-493d-8466-b0a648516f9d"}

The central idea is to split the incoming data streams (based on their contents, rates, and destinations) and then spread the pieces across multiple channels, each of which is implemented as an independent dissemination tree. We present the basic design and evaluation of SemCast, an overlay-network based system that implements this semantic multicast approach. Through a detailed simulation study and realistic network topologies, we demonstrate that SemCast significantly improves the efficiency of dissemination compared to traditional approaches.", "authors": ["Olga Papaemmanouil", "Ugur \u00c7etintemel"], "n_citation": 95, "references": ["074b01bc-a31f-4838-b783-d698b393cd57", "12d25f16-bb33-419f-869f-3e3c1ed5ed23", "1a492dc4-6ed2-4beb-b131-2236b4593304", "20716a26-e8f3-4375-8d67-18dda5dec7ef", "26fec0d3-bf8d-40a1-8cfd-25b4ffd1a861", "285c19ef-a3a2-4e3a-bdd4-db426b25cd30", "36bf6df9-79ac-4c9a-b5a5-23822db3f9de", "379830a1-d8a3-40cc-94a1-8e12d7a12fc3", "3effcd4f-6a7c-43fb-9717-904551d9f7a1", "464036ca-e625-4da5-ae96-422ea52c79ba", "4841a548-bd64-463e-8c15-414cc237aa50", "4d8c4a8c-f7f0-4063-a576-e28326f6ced3", "6a78663f-a1fa-42cb-aeb2-629006888e14", "71bb1550-e3ca-454a-ad13-f87f3104d0af", "76cc2160-30eb-4ef9-9752-9d28cbb91667", "7dc77e66-124b-43e7-9717-fb9ae8446f49", "8d33ee89-ed11-465b-b744-05ca0fadc72f", "a8f5d4b5-0566-42d8-b7de-cea95f146399", "b14b08c5-b65b-4f18-b711-ed3d88a13480", "b60af665-f26c-42ca-bdd8-50abc77ecfaa", "b61d40f0-06b8-4779-8600-4884087348ca", "c05622f7-9da6-486f-926f-6ddaba3f9eb0", "c8771a57-de9c-44b7-966c-1ff156d3091f", "cbc01e36-33c2-4709-a00d-22e6d0727560", "fc409c48-62eb-4efc-89ba-272b04700a8b", "fe4b75be-eed1-491f-85f8-d4670a5d0728"], "title": "SemCast: semantic multicast for content-based data dissemination", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2005, "id": "8c8de501-8f0b-45ac-9ab4-3f742fa23d7e"}

The pre-processor and the state estimator are not co-located, and, at every time-step, the pre-processor transmits either a real number or a free symbol to the estimator. We seek the pre-processor and the estimator that jointly minimize a cost that combines two terms; the expected squared state estimation error and a communication cost. In our formulation, the transmission of a real number from the pre-processor to the estimator incurs a positive cost while free symbols induce zero cost.

The large size and the condition of many technical or physical applications in this area result in the need for efficient parallelization and preconditioning techniques of the CG method, in particular on massively parallel machines. Here, the data distribution and the communication scheme for the sparse matrix operations of the preconditioned CG are based on the analysis of the indices of the non-zero elements. Polynomial preconditioning is shown to reduce global synchronizations considerably, and a fully local incomplete Cholesky preconditioner is presented. On a PARAGON XP/S 10 with 138 processors, the developed parallel methods outperform diagonally scaled CG markedly with respect to both scaling behavior and execution time for many matrices from real finite element applications.", "authors": ["Achim Basermann", "B.

{"abstract": "Specializing programs with respect to run-time invariants is an optimization technique that has shown to improve the performance of programs substantially. It allows a program to adapt to execution contexts that are valid for a limited time.Run-time specialization is being actively investigated in a variety of areas. For example, recently, major operating system research projects have been focusing on run-time specialization as a means to obtain efficiency from highly extensible and parameterized systems.This paper describes a general approach to run-time specialization. For a given program and a declaration of its run-time invariants, it automatically produces source templates at compile time, and transforms them so that they can be processed by a standard compiler. At run time, only minor operations need to be performed: selecting and copying templates, filling holes with run-time values, and relocating jump targets. As a consequence, run-time specialization is performed very efficiently and thus does not require the specialized code to be executed many times before its cost is amortized.Our approach improves on previous work in that: (1) templates are automatically produced from the source program and its invariants, (2) the approach is not machine dependent, (3) it is formally defined and proved correct, (4) it is efficient, as shown by our implementation for the C language.", "authors": ["Charles Consel", "Fran\u00e7ois No\u00ebl"], "n_citation": 318, "references": ["259e0b39-5127-48b6-a7f3-9ab5a7022a1b", "3a6bbf92-20f8-42a3-9eac-9552e5239ce7", "56b26b84-345b-420d-96fc-47c9dc3fca5c", "985d03bc-5708-4a21-a7f7-6f15cab23f03", "b90549de-e820-4ca7-a3d5-f4ec755027e7", "d9035db3-79ec-4a0b-b80c-7246fd8e24d3", "dbe707a1-ecde-425c-a028-2e6e164bdcc0", "dd5e9bb3-7fbc-464c-8c8f-fa113c2852c6", "f23fdbbc-a170-4433-81b5-66ef3cbf6a34", "f463aff0-142c-4163-b489-ba62d7bcb4d5"], "title": "A general approach for run-time specialization and its application to C", "venue": "symposium on principles of programming languages", "year": 1996, "id": "714b9b11-563e-4194-8bbb-e1abe8a02c60"}
{"abstract": "Despite the upsurge of interest in the Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) paradigm, there remain few results on test data generation techniques for AOP. Furthermore, there is no work on search-based optimization for test data generation, an approach that has been shown to be successful in other programming paradigms.   In this paper, we introduce a search-based optimization approach to automated test data generation for structural coverage of AOP systems. We present the results of an empirical study that demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach.

{"abstract": "Embedded hard real-time systems need reliable guarantees for the satisfaction of their timing constraints. Experience with the use of static timing-analysis methods and the tools based on them in the automotive and the aeronautics industries is positive. However, both the precision of the results and the efficiency of the analysis methods are highly dependent on the predictability of the execution platform. In fact, the architecture determines whether a static timing analysis is practically feasible at all and whether the most precise obtainable results are precise enough. Results contained in this paper also show that measurement-based methods still used in industry are not useful for quite commonly used complex processors. This dependence on the architectural development is of growing concern to the developers of timing-analysis tools and their customers, the developers in industry. The problem reaches a new level of severity with the advent of multicore architectures in the embedded domain.

{"abstract": "Hardware manufacturers are increasingly outsourcing their IC fabrication work overseas due to their much lower cost structure. This poses a significant security risk for ICs used for critical military and business applications. Attackers can exploit this loss of control to substitute Trojan ICs for genuine ones or insert a Trojan circuit into the design or mask used for fabrication. We show that a technique borrowed from side-channel cryptanalysis can be used to mitigate this problem. Our approach uses noise modeling to construct a set of fingerprints/or an IC family utilizing side- channel information such as power, temperature, and electromagnetic (EM) profiles. The set of fingerprints can be developed using a few ICs from a batch and only these ICs would have to be invasively tested to ensure that they were all authentic. The remaining ICs are verified using statistical tests against the fingerprints. We describe the theoretical framework and present preliminary experimental results to show that this approach is viable by presenting results obtained by using power simulations performed on representative circuits with several different Trojan circuitry. These results show that Trojans that are 3-4 orders of magnitude smaller than the main circuit can be detected by signal processing techniques. While scaling our technique to detect even smaller Trojans in complex ICs with tens or hundreds of millions of transistors would require certain modifications to the IC design process, our results provide a starting point to address this important problem.", "authors": ["Dakshi Agrawal", "Selcuk Baktir", "Deniz Karakoyunlu", "Pankaj Rohatgi", "Berk Sunar"], "n_citation": 640, "references": ["033ebb72-0119-4cc9-89b8-f011c55ddd79", "071ea94f-fddb-4348-b8ee-5da24628322c", "08e8a55e-a194-496b-b27d-f00b33bba303", "3fb43b00-905c-4a08-934d-198ea4eb66c3", "47172258-af45-4cb6-b6fb-869ebb48ec90", "4ef5e29d-bfa1-46e2-8e59-d52d060ef770", "597c85f9-b357-45d1-a621-9f545f7bf3f8", "7844c203-9e7b-40ca-a61d-0a144064410e", "8617c041-a478-4dad-ab76-a6bd98fef1a7", "a8839f12-cda0-4ee0-a641-6c4422ac19d9", "b1e12da0-6cc3-4bdb-bbd8-4a13824a234e", "c5920c8a-ace1-48a2-bf68-67f3c6d41512", "fd889acc-fd0c-4e85-9cfd-b88e64120e22"], "title": "Trojan Detection using IC Fingerprinting", "venue": "ieee symposium on security and privacy", "year": 2007, "id": "a8080fa3-8df0-4d8d-aa0b-8dd9c268904a"}
{"abstract": "We provide an automated method to repair broken, occluded oriented image textures. Our approach is based on partial differential equations (PDEs) and AM-FM image modeling. Reconstruction of the texture occurs via simultaneous PDE-generated diffusion and reaction. In the diffusion process, the image is adaptively smoothed, preserving important boundaries and features. The reaction process produces the reconstructed textural information in the occluded image regions. Gabor (1946) filters are designed and used in the reaction process using an AM-FM dominant component analysis. An AM-FM model of the texture image is constructed, making it possible to localize the reaction filters spatio-spectrally. In contrast to previous disocclusion techniques that depend on interpolation, on continuity of the connected components within the image level sets, or on texture estimation, the reaction-diffusion process proposed here yields a seamless transition between the recreated region and the unoccluded image regions. Using AM-FM dominant component analysis, we avoid the ad hoc parameter selection typified with other reaction-diffusion approaches. As a useful example, we focus on the repair of broken, occluded fingerprints. We also treat several exemplary natural textures to demonstrate the technique's generality.", "authors": ["Scott T.

{"abstract": "Experience is not always a benign teacher. Examples often contain irrelevant features, the relevant features may be noisy, and the results may not be categorical. Most learning systems, however, assume that the teacher is benign, and in particular that the training cases are free of noise. This paper describes a system, IWN, which can learn classification knowledge from a relatively small number of training cases but whose performance does not rapidly deteriorate when the training cases contain noise. IWN uses a network of weighted links to represent classification knowledge. This use of a non-discrete knowledge representation enables IWN to be more robust in the face of noisy data. In this paper we describe IWN's procedure for building its weighted networks and how IWN's performance compares with other systems. A central focus will be on how several different evaluation functions for propagating values in the network affect the tradeoff between handling noisy data and handling exceptional cases.", "authors": ["Ming Tan", "Larry J.

It is a variant of the sellers' price double auction, which makes the bidders as a group through Internet to get the volume discounts, i.e., the more bidders bid, the lower the price of the object being auctioned becomes. In this paper, we analyze the group-buying auction under some assumptions, such as that the independent private values (IPVs) model applies and bidders are risk neutral and symmetric, etc., and build an incomplete information dynamic game model to illustrate the bidders' bidding process. It proves that for the bidders there exists a weakly dominant strategy S, i.e., no matter when a bidder arrives at the auction and what the bidding history is, the highest permitted bid price that is no greater than his value to the object is always his optimal bid price but may not be the unique one.", "authors": ["Jian Chen", "Xilong Chen", "Xiping Song"], "n_citation": 104, "references": ["2031c5af-c2ea-4e85-be7a-501622df7c77", "2461efcf-39c5-4931-b256-bc46110753db", "ebab23f3-1035-4b7f-af2c-c2edba74134b", "f30ba63b-af3c-49c3-9036-70a11a278766"], "title": "Bidder's strategy under group-buying auction on the Internet", "venue": "systems man and cybernetics", "year": 2002, "id": "fb4bd187-c728-4c35-a506-1336d77a3c12"}
{"abstract": "Mobisaic is a World Wide Web information system designed to serve users in a mobile wireless computing environment. Mobisaic extends the Web by allowing documents to both refer and react to potentially changing contextual information, such as current location in the wireless network. Mobisaic relies on client side processing of HTML documents that support two new concepts: dynamic uniform resource locators (URLs) and active documents. A dynamic URL is one whose results depend upon the state of the user's mobile context at the time it is resolved. An active document is one that automatically updates its contents in response to changes in a user's mobile context. The paper describes the design of Mobisaic, the mechanism it uses for representing a user's mobile context, and the extensions made to the syntax and function of uniform resource locators and HyperText markup language documents to support mobility.", "authors": ["Geoffrey M.

{"abstract": "Context detection for mobile users plays a major role for enabling novel, human-centric interfaces. For this, we introduce a context detection scheme applicable in a self-organized sensor network, which is formed of disseminated, computer empowered sensors, referred to as Smart-Its [1]. Context-detection takes place without requiring any central point of control, and supports push as well as pull modes. Our solution is based on an in-network composition approach relying on so-called smart Context-Aware Packets (sCAPs). These packets act as a uniform interchange format, and allow single sensors to share sensed data and to cooperate to build up a meaningful context model from manifold inputs. sCAPs travel through the sensor network governed by an enclosed retrieving plan, specifying which sensors to visit in order to gain a specific piece of context information. For enhanced flexibility, the retrieving plan itself may be dynamically altered in accordance with past sensor readings.", "authors": ["Florian Michahelles", "Michael Samulowitz"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0c7ae0c4-631a-4f56-b612-9bc5400e50d3", "31c5e39a-3f24-4d20-bf8c-3d00036baf95", "32b7988a-f873-44c9-bacb-0d660fe12f01", "55a6413a-4a9c-4e8d-957b-8c1a4e5d5f0b", "5fd22977-137c-4b3b-904c-f05e02f4fb31", "8ae2021d-7b2b-45ea-8a55-10134a7c6520", "8fd68107-3b8f-41d0-8092-9fd733ecf76e", "d1bb6fa0-934c-4435-bcdc-609e1e288b1c", "f76dda3d-9cee-45b4-acc4-8456b7465a86"], "title": "Smart CAPs for Smart Its \u2013 Context Detection for Mobile Users", "venue": "ubiquitous computing", "year": 2002, "id": "8447ed49-0854-4480-9612-e284f99bdb43"}

{"abstract": "This work deals with trajectory optimization for a robotic sensor network sampling a spatio-temporal random field. We examine the optimal sampling problem of minimizing the maximum predictive variance of the estimator over the space of network trajectories. This is a high-dimensional, multi-modal, nonsmooth optimization problem, known to be NP-hard even for static fields and discrete design spaces. Under an asymptotic regime of near-independence between distinct sample locations, we show that the solutions to a novel generalized disk-covering problem are solutions to the optimal sampling problem. This result effectively transforms the search for the optimal trajectories into a geometric optimization problem. Constrained versions of the latter are also of interest as they can accommodate trajectories that satisfy a maximum velocity restriction on the robots. We characterize the solution for the unconstrained and constrained versions of the geometric optimization problem as generalized multicircumcenter trajectories, and provide algorithms which enable the network to find them in a distributed fashion.

We demonstrate the power of multilinear subspace analysis in the context of facial image ensembles, where the relevant factors include different faces, expressions, viewpoints, and illuminations. In prior work we showed that our multilinear representation, called TensorFaces, yields superior facial recognition rates relative to standard, linear (PCA/eigenfaces) approaches.

{"abstract": "The field of multiple criteria decision analysis (MCDA) - also sometimes termed multiple criteria decision aid, or multiple criteria decision making (MCDM) - has developed rapidly over the past quarter century and in the process a number of divergent schools of thought have emerged. Multiple Criteria Decision Analysis: An Integrated Approach provides a comprehensive yet widely accessible overview of the main streams of thought within MCDA. Two principal aims are: To provide sufficient awareness of the underlying philosophies and theories, understanding of the practical detail of the methods, and insight into practice to enable researchers, students and industry practitioners to implement MCDA methods in an informed manner; To develop an integrated view of MCDA, incorporating both integration of different schools of thought within MCDA and integration of MCDA with broader management theory, science and practice, thereby informing the development of theory and practice across these areas. It is felt that this two-fold emphasis gives a book which will be of value to the following three groups: Practicing decision analysts or graduate students in MCDA for whom this book should serve as a state-of-the-art review, especially as regards techniques outside of their own specialization; Operational researchers or graduate students in OR/MS who wish to extend their knowledge into the tools of MCDA; Managers or management students who need to understand what MCDA can offer them. Review: The book...is an excellent overview of the different multiple criteria approaches developed in divergent schools of thought which emerged in the last three decades. This book is not only a theoretical document, but also provides good coverage of practical issues. It can be recommended to a broad audience, ranging from those in academic institutions to practitioners, as well as those who are interested in finding information on multiple criteria approaches, methods and techniques. It is an excellent book in the main area of Operations Research and Decision Analysis, with a special focus on Multiple Criteria and is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students.' JosA(c) R.

{"abstract": "This paper presents the evaluation of the average bit error rate (BER) performance of linear space-time block codes (STBC) from orthogonal designs over correlated identically distributed Nakagami-m fading channels. Starting from the moment-generating function (MGF) of the multipath component signals at the antenna array elements, analytical expressions of the BER performance for both integral and nonintegral Nakagami-m fading parameters are derived. Closed-form expressions of the spatial cross-correlation function for mobile nonfrequency selective Nakagami-m fading multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels are obtained, which are valid for small angle-of-arrival (AOA) spread. In this expressions, various parameters of interest, such as the mean AOA of the signal, AOA spread, and array configurations, are all taken into account. The effects of antenna array configuration and the operating environment (mean AOA, AOA spread, Nakagami fading parameter) on the BER performance of the system are illustrated by several numerical examples.", "authors": ["Guillem Femenias"], "n_citation": 85, "references": ["0e9c6cac-2bd7-4dab-bf8d-c9fe81a75995", "1d9562b1-f30a-45de-b791-254d2d0e2fb5", "2659531e-eb9d-4dd5-b46f-10f66a4819c6", "26d87ec9-836a-4908-a993-9e3c8e3c10a5", "2a0cc817-1154-42a6-85d0-d89bd5a85786", "324c0cc6-829c-4b4f-8ef4-5f2d9b34bf58", "4a7492a5-2c3e-4db7-8f17-83b639658f60", "4cffd93f-85d2-4850-92c1-8954ac9579f2", "5f86cff4-6552-4391-9eec-f5db3c2f79bb", "647b57cf-8e40-42db-ac35-f7746c8565d2", "68f479e4-dd75-4fdf-94b9-05977ef4705d", "748a2ab3-8b5f-4d0a-9e2d-af685089843a", "9ab79683-476a-4e5e-a002-26a6dbae4156", "aef8a0bd-4a41-44a5-9033-e11bc8648096", "b4bb1d29-5935-4491-9375-d38d4871a8ad", "c88a6cf0-e641-49eb-a603-a2e4cac03a5a", "d7168f76-48d9-466c-9775-4e4ff3ae3acb", "d87f0dcb-5f38-4c6c-b49b-3606af081c45", "da4a4368-211b-44db-93ab-0a4da24ab050", "da979bae-4adf-4e04-af3b-d4f27ac86d38", "f17aed8c-2406-41b2-a553-89738c18ca11", "fac9ab50-7b01-44bf-ae6a-44f0b9a12946", "fff34625-0763-4ccf-ba97-17a60311112a"], "title": "BER performance of linear STBC from orthogonal designs over MIMO correlated Nakagami-m fading channels", "venue": "vehicular technology conference", "year": 2004, "id": "37f99bc5-8001-4a79-b531-741e41f367cf"}
{"abstract": "This empirical study has two goals. First, to investigate the impact of a design heuristic on the maintainability of object-oriented designs, namely the 'god class' problem. In other words, we wish to better understand to what extent a specific design heuristic contributes to the quality of designs developed. The second goal is to investigate the relationship between that OO design heuristic and metrics. Namely, are we able to capture a specific design heuristic by applying a suitable subset of design metrics? The results of this study show that: (a) the investigated design heuristic significantly affects the performance of the participants; (b) it also affects the evolution of design structures; and (c) there is a considerable relationship between that design heuristic and metrics so that it could be feasible to conduct an assessment by using appropriate metrics.", "authors": ["Ignatios S.

In this paper we develop a probabilistic model for syntactically analysing such compounds.

Problems inherent in this corpus-based approach are addressed: data sparseness is overcome by the use of semantically motivated word classes and sense ambiguity is explicitly handled in the model.

{"abstract": "The transactional memory programming paradigm is gaining momentum as the approach of choice for replacing locks in concurrent programming. This paper introduces the transactional locking II (TL2) algorithm, a software transactional memory (STM) algorithm based on a combination of commit-time locking and a novel global version-clock based validation technique. TL2 improves on state-of-the-art STMs in the following ways: (1) unlike all other STMs it fits seamlessly with any system's memory life-cycle, including those using malloc/free (2) unlike all other lock-based STMs it efficiently avoids periods of unsafe execution, that is, using its novel version-clock validation, user code is guaranteed to operate only on consistent memory states, and (3) in a sequence of high performance benchmarks, while providing these new properties, it delivered overall performance comparable to (and in many cases better than) that of all former STM algorithms, both lock-based and non-blocking. Perhaps more importantly, on various benchmarks, TL2 delivers performance that is competitive with the best hand-crafted fine-grained concurrent structures. Specifically, it is ten-fold faster than a single lock. We believe these characteristics make TL2 a viable candidate for deployment of transactional memory today, long before hardware transactional support is available.", "authors": ["David Dice", "Ori Shalev", "Nir Shavit"], "n_citation": 1037, "references": ["1f973151-3c29-4199-a28c-612f7388d5cc", "2694f41b-c769-4b50-a395-d78cee0fc955", "2a1a717b-356a-44f6-a7cb-749ebcece1ef", "2d694676-76df-4997-a266-a9a42828283a", "3c9affe5-a987-43bd-89a9-68eb9762659b", "52b80e36-c680-4111-931f-9179781a4a38", "62ce6aa9-bd3a-4f19-a909-838c25dd0088", "7c96541d-233a-4102-ac9f-6349a879e248", "8a82dd8c-7fc6-4c80-9f4e-38fe45e7ecba", "91296da4-8e61-4628-bd24-ef7b2b3eb375", "c6d9c64e-46c0-4fd8-92b9-3753f47a7807", "ea62b144-8fe5-4caa-8789-08eac39c36a1", "fd5aa677-6a9a-48b3-a820-175f9f9b3c7d"], "title": "Transactional locking II", "venue": "international symposium on distributed computing", "year": 2006, "id": "7d5bb803-38e1-416a-b933-30b3dda8ab3c"}

{"abstract": "One role for workload generation is as a means for understanding how servers and networks respond to variation in load. This enables management and capacity planning based on current and projected usage. This paper applies a number of observations of Web server usage to create a realistic Web workload generation tool which mimics a set of real users accessing a server. The tool, called  Surge  (Scalable URL Reference Generator) generates references matching empirical measurements of 1) server file size distribution; 2) request size distribution; 3) relative file popularity; 4) embedded file references; 5) temporal locality of reference; and 6) idle periods of individual users.

{"abstract": "Many software systems have evolved to include a Web-based component that makes them available to the public via the Internet and can expose them to a variety of Web-based attacks. One of these attacks is SQL injection, which can give attackers unrestricted access to the databases that underlie Web applications and has become increasingly frequent and serious. This paper presents a new highly automated approach for protecting Web applications against SQL injection that has both conceptual and practical advantages over most existing techniques. From a conceptual standpoint, the approach is based on the novel idea of positive tainting and on the concept of syntax-aware evaluation. From a practical standpoint, our technique is precise and efficient, has minimal deployment requirements, and incurs a negligible performance overhead in most cases. We have implemented our techniques in the Web application SQL-injection preventer (WASP) tool, which we used to perform an empirical evaluation on a wide range of Web applications that we subjected to a large and varied set of attacks and legitimate accesses. WASP was able to stop all of the otherwise successful attacks and did not generate any false positives.", "authors": ["William G. J.

Much has been written about open innovation and its manifestation in the form of crowdsourcing. Unfortunately, most management research has taken the information system (IS) as a given. In this essay we contend that IS is not just an enabler but rather can be a shaper that optimizes open innovation in general and crowdsourcing in particular. This essay is intended to frame crowdsourcing for innovation in a manner that makes more apparent the issues that require research from an IS perspective.

{"abstract": "Differential privacy is a powerful tool for providing privacy-preserving noisy query answers over statistical databases. It guarantees that the distribution of noisy query answers changes very little with the addition or deletion of any tuple. It is frequently accompanied by popularized claims that it provides privacy without any assumptions about the data and that it protects against attackers who know all but one record. In this paper we critically analyze the privacy protections offered by differential privacy.   First, we use a no-free-lunch theorem, which defines non-privacy as a game, to argue that it is not possible to provide privacy and utility without making assumptions about how the data are generated. Then we explain where assumptions are needed. We argue that privacy of an individual is preserved when it is possible to limit the inference of an attacker about the  participation  of the individual in the data generating process. This is different from limiting the inference about the presence of a tuple (for example, Bob's participation in a social network may cause edges to form between pairs of his friends, so that it affects more than just the tuple labeled as \"Bob\"). The definition of evidence of participation, in turn, depends on how the data are generated -- this is how assumptions enter the picture. We explain these ideas using examples from social network research as well as tabular data for which deterministic statistics have been previously released. In both cases the notion of participation varies, the use of differential privacy can lead to privacy breaches, and differential privacy does not always adequately limit inference about participation.", "authors": ["Daniel Kifer", "Ashwin Machanavajjhala"], "n_citation": 251, "references": ["14a299be-49d3-4a6d-b180-35a8f77b8a07", "1b383345-1644-4913-ae8a-f252d55cb074", "2b78227d-7cc3-4e64-bedd-195272ba6348", "2d34b952-1d15-4cd3-9e1f-7337581e945c", "32fd9fa0-0857-4bbc-8e40-b947c02e9d8b", "369fa210-cdbf-4cbf-9d34-e8bc81f45097", "396c6192-d592-41a9-a37e-9bc3efa5dfd7", "4e589195-cadb-4d90-8082-cf4307d6e24f", "510a59fd-537c-4b09-8d02-4012ec0ad0ce", "52fb6a0f-4b8f-4af3-adea-9ee741490cd6", "5b26d855-551c-47cc-be7b-0bb83b54efd7", "700672fd-23a3-4ac5-bbd5-9c6139a36507", "70f4dcf0-2784-4627-899c-1463988a3f52", "9a9042ef-19fd-4cc4-90db-059122355179", "9acaf04e-0214-42b7-8e32-03f26424402a", "acfb77cd-46c1-4998-96e0-324b53fd410c", "b7a029fd-c208-4e6a-8f2c-54714bca574c", "cdd78425-1862-4168-8bbe-5837326f1ed6", "d4a627d4-d46f-47a4-ae67-f5f023dd8ea2", "d7527d1f-d63a-4b7f-953a-731dab206d99", "e1dfe8b2-432e-45a6-908c-9068028bc3e0", "f6e345a5-8fc0-49da-891a-465f0234dc81"], "title": "No free lunch in data privacy", "venue": "international conference on management of data", "year": 2011, "id": "b132bbac-799b-4cec-8ec1-eec195be3a13"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, we investigate reducing the power consumption of a synchronous digital system by minimizing the total power consumed by the clock signals. We construct activity-driven clock trees wherein sections of the clock tree are turned off by gating the clock signals. Since gating the clock signal implies that additional control signals and gates are needed, there exists a tradeoff between the amount of clock tree gating and the total power consumption of the clock tree. We exploit similarities in the switching activity of the clocked modules to reduce the number of clock gates. Assuming a given switching activity of the modules, we propose three novel activity-driven problems: a clock tree construction problem, a clock gate insertion problem, and a zero-skew clock gate insertion problem. The objective of these problems is to minimize the system's power consumption by constructing an activity-driven clock tree. We propose an approximation algorithm based on recursive matching to solve the clock tree construction problem. We also propose an exact algorithm employing the dynamic programming paradigm to solve the gate insertion problems. Finally, we present experimental results that verify the effectiveness of our approach. This paper is a step in understanding how high-level decisions (e.g., behavioral design) can affect a low-level design (e.g., clock design).", "authors": ["Amir H.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we study and characterize the topology of the Internet at the autonomous system (AS) level. First, we show that the topology can be described efficiently with power laws. The elegance and simplicity of the power laws provide a novel perspective into the seemingly uncontrolled Internet structure. Second, we show that power laws have appeared consistently over the last five years. We also observe that the power laws hold even in the most recent and more complete topology with correlation coefficient above 99% for the degree-based power law. In addition, we study the evolution of the power-law exponents over the five-year interval and observe a variation for the degree-based power law of less than 10%. Third, we provide relationships between the exponents and other topological metrics.", "authors": ["Georgos Siganos", "Michalis Faloutsos", "Petros Faloutsos", "Christos Faloutsos"], "n_citation": 484, "references": ["02939ce0-3069-46d5-8e0b-c655e6bd5117", "05332f60-3d2e-45bb-9ecd-a7c7aa7774dc", "0b26e3b6-97c5-4a17-b462-4df399b59eb7", "1315a20e-5fc9-418f-b483-faa9c5f6334f", "1a24e9c7-d0ce-4be4-8e3a-c849b4630851", "2111839d-49a6-4f2c-a3e3-c52d2d3c41bb", "221a51ba-b64d-4bf4-b9b9-968b9d7bd99e", "221d7846-d47f-4a48-883f-e5eb2aa2a5a6", "2222f1f9-b357-45ef-8943-ae096e660c5f", "244fb53f-c5a9-4b7c-a756-007e2d091cee", "28af31e8-07f0-4017-acb1-45246f5b4f90", "312ac3f8-3cb6-4d38-819a-1f74fac005a0", "3ac02c8c-2bb6-426e-8650-a03680f27cee", "4ae5b9f4-ed00-44b6-a93e-87c4d52c653e", "4e84e6a9-bae7-4035-9d31-df7871e028f3", "60ef3852-fa16-44bf-9434-9909268ba5d8", "686c5563-3f13-4744-ac6d-1020e39953bf", "7d371899-f6a5-4e16-8365-835827db041e", "990beb01-03d1-4b11-8e01-6e4ec6015124", "9d57305f-9744-4504-8f35-943f05094d17", "afd4c865-5c81-424b-82c3-1dcb6150ea6d", "b467fdca-fd01-4d8d-8ad5-bb262cc476c1", "b5287e1f-d05b-45b9-a342-d7d2cd318420", "c82d6f8e-5ad6-4317-af5a-86d4b6bcf225", "c93abb4e-959f-49ad-8dd4-554a6c3e7d09", "cca8a182-5bad-45d6-8091-d11882e3f2ba", "ccc5eeaa-bbb5-4224-b7a7-6583f6b6ae01", "d8d45f06-8f07-4d67-919d-46071c69593f", "d9e71400-57ec-443b-8e71-9eb5c3c40632", "de0fadd9-2af2-46e4-a432-f74880eb48ad", "e1cab27a-b1fa-4677-b015-0914e2170bad", "e7e903c0-73f7-459a-b77a-3d04691ed71a", "ea1ce8d0-7a36-489a-8f13-e6a5e2960b2c", "ef3894e7-7d06-4e66-8e47-782d6ceceb6a", "f15b19f2-4b37-454c-851e-a71cccf3e53a", "f353f651-1349-46f5-b1aa-a81b29654522", "f59ab5a3-c1d7-4287-9780-2b04d99e7f5c", "fe936596-cab6-4eae-9188-4ab9f238780c"], "title": "Power laws and the AS-level Internet topology", "venue": "IEEE\\/ACM Transactions on Networking", "year": 2003, "id": "6cc458f0-a6d8-4b95-a3d9-1df61ae86223"}

{"abstract": "Internet has given software providers possibilities for electronic software distribution (ESD). At the same time bandwidth limitations lead to poor performance and scalability of the delivery process. The problem is even harder when delivering large, resource consuming software packages and media content.

We analyze the possibility of applying the peer-to-peer technology to the process of software delivery, relying on the experience and learned lessons of the related technologies. To this effect we analyze the available material on this topic and identify the important criteria that are crucial for the wide acceptance of ESD by both software providers and end-users.

{"abstract": "Aggregation and cube are important operations for online analytical processing (OLAP). Many efficient algorithms to compute aggregation and cube for relational OLAP have been developed. Some work has been done on efficiently computing cube for multidimensional data warehouses that store data sets in multidimensional arrays rather than in tables. However, to our knowledge, there is nothing to date in the literature describing aggregation algorithms on compressed data warehouses for multidimensional OLAP. This paper presents a set of aggregation algorithms on compressed data warehouses for multidimensional OLAP. These algorithms operate directly on compressed data sets, which are compressed by the mapping-complete compression methods, without the need to first decompress them. The algorithms have different performance behaviors as a function of the data set parameters, sizes of outputs and main memory availability. The algorithms are described and the I/O and CPU cost functions are presented in this paper. A decision procedure to select the most efficient algorithm for a given aggregation request is also proposed. The analysis and experimental results show that the algorithms have better performance on sparse data than the previous aggregation algorithms.", "authors": ["Jianzhong Li", "Jaideep Srivastava"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["07416413-8701-4feb-a883-5268ff9e90a5", "08f723e5-bc19-4c38-8adf-17796ca0ec01", "195e19e7-734c-435e-a942-b12ca831f7e1", "196803d1-e419-4897-9dc9-b760208c802e", "2264fdf2-7e5d-4ac3-9b3b-d2a825c08ac3", "347d2035-9b23-4715-ac3b-dd5fe0b4b93f", "3d100103-1b65-465c-ad51-b96c5209b04e", "55894738-a827-4cca-9cf4-8d89cfb8c4f2", "939e2f9c-9caa-45a7-81d6-9beb6b6bd87e", "9f907f6a-f252-4f6b-8955-ff50970d31a8", "d10f840c-1003-48b5-8aec-3ecc0957c658", "de1e03b5-37d7-4a4c-9c39-6a84fff760c2", "ea6e92b8-95f9-4a46-946b-137d9aaa590d", "eece754c-c340-4d27-a186-b62542dacc9e", "f277fc64-2cb9-48fd-8cb7-d993df39da10"], "title": "Efficient aggregation algorithms for compressed data warehouses", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": 2002, "id": "d41ff238-fd77-4f21-a1d6-1d7b189960ce"}

The main innovation is that no \"features\" are detected at any stage: contours are simply assumed to remove statistical dependencies between pixels on opposite sides of the contour. This assumption, together with a simple model of shape variability of the geometric models, leads to the application of an EM method for maximizing the likelihood of pose parameters.

{"abstract": "Variants of the background subtraction method are broadly used for the detection of moving objects in video sequences in different applications. In this work we propose a new approach to the background subtraction method which operates in the colour space and manages the colour information in the segmentation process to detect and eliminate noise. This new method is combined with blob-level knowledge associated with different types of blobs that may appear in the foreground. The idea is to process each pixel differently according to the category to which it belongs: real moving objects, shadows, ghosts, reflections, fluctuation or background noise. Thus, the foreground resulting from processing each image frame is refined selectively, applying at each instant the appropriate operator according to the type of noise blob we wish to eliminate. The approach proposed is adaptive, because it allows both the background model and threshold model to be updated. On the one hand, the results obtained confirm the robustness of the method proposed in a wide range of different sequences and, on the other hand, these results underline the importance of handling three colour components in the segmentation process rather than just the one grey-level component.", "authors": ["Enrique J.

An agent is competent when it is capable of reasoning about its own competence and that of the other agents with which it cooperates in a given domain. In our framework, an agent has competence models of itself and of its acquaintances from which it can decide, for a specific problem to be solved, the type of cooperative activity it can request and from which agent.

{"abstract": "One of the major challenges in engineering distributed multiagent systems is the coordination necessary to align the behavior of different agents. Decentralization of control implies a style of coordination in which the agents cooperate as peers with respect to each other and no agent has global control over the system, or global knowledge about the system. The dynamic interactions and collaborations among agents are usually structured and managed by means of roles and organizations. In existing approaches agents typically have a dual responsibility: on the one hand playing roles within the organization, on the other hand managing the life-cycle of the organization itself, for example, setting up the organization and managing organization dynamics. Engineering realistic multiagent systems in which agents encapsulate this dual responsibility is a complex task.   In this article, we present a middleware for context-driven dynamic agent organizations. The middleware is part of an integrated approach, called MACODO: Middleware Architecture for COntext-driven Dynamic agent Organizations. The complementary part of the MACODO approach is an organization model that defines abstractions to support application developers in describing dynamic organizations, as described in Weyns et al. [2010].   The MACODO middleware offers the life-cycle management of dynamic organizations as a reusable service separated from the agents, which makes it easier to understand, design, and manage dynamic organizations in multiagent systems. We give a detailed description of the software architecture of the MADOCO middleware. The software architecture describes the essential building blocks of a distributed middleware platform that supports the MACODO organization model. We used the middleware architecture to develop a prototype middleware platform for a traffic monitoring application. We evaluate the MACODO middeware architecture by assessing the adaptability, scalability, and robustness of the prototype platform.", "authors": ["Danny Weyns", "Robrecht Haesevoets", "Alexander Helleboogh", "Tom Holvoet", "Wouter Joosen"], "n_citation": 54, "references": ["00199e54-1891-4e79-b6e5-ca2b631753d4", "1a70170c-e012-4ac5-a774-0247fe3f4b5b", "1eb6772b-40e6-455a-a2c9-b3da46f0b459", "27ab2b78-0fd0-465b-85a6-b53d8467f7bb", "2b375452-5017-40dd-b438-21419c36bbd1", "3a32d085-0fa6-4867-8c36-d89465a8b507", "40d5d62c-353e-408b-8256-2c59128ca519", "415c7281-44cb-4b78-84d5-890a3e88df26", "43d38aaf-4746-426b-a3c3-3f0c341b4900", "7281029e-9726-4dfb-b64e-fbc1d4cc3c13", "9b9c464b-2a7e-4063-b2f3-0c1653964207", "a14f5628-4a99-460e-8742-6f29339b6c8b", "a440cade-25a5-4375-a336-62c9dc66afa7", "b5fa0a5b-991b-4552-9bf8-bb78e270b2a7", "b6811f60-0fda-4c64-b7fe-4fcc669fb08c", "b80eb15c-0040-4939-b131-2bf63d8c38b1", "cce94fb6-6fb8-4f99-9289-b362028fb41f", "d40fb968-0024-4bae-933a-6c1d7620e684", "d559cc27-d054-447b-8510-4b45acce3390", "e3916584-9e4f-4d35-a311-c3810dbca602", "e852dced-1395-486e-be34-42889ac69e91", "f0300784-9c70-453d-a9f2-de5070cba4a2", "f706bef5-5020-4cb8-a63c-f7f277fa1570"], "title": "The MACODO middleware for context-driven dynamic agent organizations", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Autonomous and Adaptive Systems", "year": 2010, "id": "dcfa9297-21bc-440a-83ff-e533672a0035"}

{"abstract": "This paper proposes an enhanced model predictive discrete-time sliding mode control (MPDSMC) with proportional-integral (PI) sliding function and state observer for the motion tracking control of a nanopositioning system driven by piezoelectric actuators. One distinct advantage of the proposed controller lies in that its implementation only requires a simple second-order model of the system, whereas it does not need to know neither the hysteresis model nor the bounds on system uncertainties. The unmodeled hysteresis is eliminated by the one-step delayed disturbance estimation technique and the neglected residual modes are suppressed by employing a properly-designed state observer. Moreover, the reasons why the model predictive control methodology and PI action can eliminate the chattering effects and produce a low level of tracking error are discovered in state-space framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of the proposed MPDSMC controller is superior to both conventional PID and DSMC methods in motion tracking tasks. A precise tracking is achieved by the nanopositioning stage along with the hysteretic nonlinearity mitigated to a negligible level, which validates the feasibility of the proposed controller in the domain of micro-/nanomanipulation.", "authors": ["Qingsong Xu", "Yangmin Li"], "n_citation": 63, "references": ["097a0363-3925-4ca9-acef-ba608274a296", "26230d0b-fa29-4f38-b345-62f0ec843cea", "36bad844-5714-4ffd-b6e0-b816f77e167f", "3f6058a8-d19c-4752-9780-e38300401c25", "6b046483-9054-4037-8e3a-052dac31614f", "709ed189-1fcb-410a-b0bd-3cbb3bacfab6", "8709577a-d6bd-41ff-a08a-428cd9094c08", "8aaf2b22-d3f8-4cc3-b06f-b543c2ad9a75", "9bcf2604-76ce-4d1f-a279-c7abb899b68d", "b6076079-eca7-4c8b-afde-7744f2b4e739", "b792896f-aeec-42dd-9b09-2a0d1bb37224", "b810aaaf-42b0-4a81-b758-ccd0a71484e3", "c55b39fe-c501-46bd-91ab-3b93a13d396a", "d316f974-ef8f-4d6a-a743-fb497dcab101", "d398c9c3-f791-4708-9975-ce0ec0a76475", "ed14ca06-693a-4e8e-8215-d2d41ecb4cbf", "fe6a4ab7-f0ce-4288-928d-9b16fbe5c9d8"], "title": "Model Predictive Discrete-Time Sliding Mode Control of a Nanopositioning Piezostage Without Modeling Hysteresis", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Control Systems and Technology", "year": 2012, "id": "84476aed-e621-43cc-b1f3-800b5ca8a032"}

{"abstract": "Extracting layers from video is very important for video representation, analysis, compression, and synthesis. Assuming that a scene can be approximately described by multiple planar regions, this paper describes a robust and novel approach to automatically extract a set of affine or projective transformations induced by these regions, detect the occlusion pixels over multiple consecutive frames, and segment the scene into several motion layers. First, after determining a number of seed regions using correspondences in two frames, we expand the seed regions and reject the outliers employing the graph cuts method integrated with level set representation. Next, these initial regions are merged into several initial layers according to the motion similarity. Third, an occlusion order constraint on multiple frames is explored, which enforces that the occlusion area increases with the temporal order in a short period and effectively maintains segmentation consistency over multiple consecutive frames. Then, the correct layer segmentation is obtained by using a graph cuts algorithm and the occlusions between the overlapping layers are explicitly determined. Several experimental results are demonstrated to show that our approach is effective and robust.", "authors": ["Jiangjian Xiao", "Mubarak Shah"], "n_citation": 231, "references": ["004aa844-c144-4f34-b328-e054848d2c82", "050a184c-1203-4e94-8da1-7dee5ced9777", "0e3c573b-8cfc-44b7-9582-0bd52924d470", "182d3eb0-fa3f-4aee-97c7-be902d6e4094", "32bfd04a-8c34-468e-b942-bdb8786d9095", "3dd48f86-e94a-41ce-9fc9-cfc823e56390", "4ba5209c-8e08-4ba7-a83a-f6c6d0c5587f", "6085f8fa-0f80-4bf9-9fc3-cb177adaba35", "60d86eba-dcd1-42fc-9bed-790987594c50", "61423840-d483-47fe-8f05-1eb28620422e", "65528efd-326c-4fb9-bfef-a43093b553cd", "6f2d104f-beaa-43a5-91ed-ec0e34eb1f57", "6ffa2a6b-e390-4675-92ac-ad4e31d4cc83", "732f1cb3-c0c3-40de-bdd0-40de75ec3a66", "7360a936-d058-41c9-aab7-d6373af93f10", "78ee5ccf-613d-4a4b-8858-33c1cf0ef461", "85471950-c85d-4494-ac99-30b5450ad095", "88b16026-ecb8-48bd-a953-89d68ad8801e", "9298ec73-f02d-4ee5-9fab-1ac3f188a910", "9a1967e7-a302-4f6d-bc3d-6457f086e8a5", "9dee56d9-8fd5-414c-83ae-31551b20ae88", "bd1498bd-791c-4875-90fa-0acbb5e7baa3", "c2cde414-12bd-406e-b772-4b4d5c68b3ca", "cdd6b1f4-012f-4678-be03-b58ef5d7f710", "d285cffc-b94d-4f81-bb6a-51ca70d95f75", "dd8087bb-bde1-4b8e-8ef0-3f8d0aabce9b", "e8f753ad-cf17-4f4c-bef8-604fbdcb772a", "f6326193-ef92-4e64-8a4e-7439f8692fa1", "fc9a9ab5-7585-419a-8d2f-cdddd99a5c25"], "title": "Motion layer extraction in the presence of occlusion using graph cuts", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": 2005, "id": "44ebc131-aec9-49f3-ae49-14d126a58a30"}

{"abstract": "Cloned code is considered harmful for two reasons: (1) multiple, possibly unnecessary, duplicates of code increase maintenance costs and, (2) inconsistent changes to cloned code can create faults and, hence, lead to incorrect program behavior. Likewise, duplicated parts of models are problematic in model-based development. Recently, we and other authors proposed multiple approaches to automatically identify duplicates in graphical models. While it has been demonstrated that these approaches work in principal, a number of challenges remain for application in industrial practice. Based on an industrial case study undertaken with the BMW Group, this paper details on these challenges and presents solutions to the most pressing ones, namely scalability and relevance of the results. Moreover, we present tool support that eases the evaluation of detection results and thereby helps to make clone detection a standard technique in model-based quality assurance.", "authors": ["Florian Deissenboeck", "Benjamin Hummel", "Elmar Juergens", "Michael Pfaehler", "Bernhard Schaetz"], "n_citation": 80, "references": ["03020c01-75d4-4c51-a90a-d66a9c80c7bc", "3bc5116d-1ba0-4a5a-a8d9-36814dcf0277", "4e539632-eacd-44cf-adc1-07255c238cf7", "51154562-31e0-4e9b-b1e8-95b282288abd", "536b005f-2909-4a87-a8c2-01a0c722849f", "593ff58d-1119-41da-a039-3d7411cd5c03", "86877346-2923-4ad6-b986-430a48970504", "b37f0062-5297-471e-8486-77b28cdd9cae", "e0d50d4e-55c8-4f3d-9ff8-88a91d765305", "fa9c74bd-9940-48fd-ad43-a980c1a1b2d2"], "title": "Model clone detection in practice", "venue": "", "year": 2010, "id": "64e5edb5-2838-440d-a35f-0758ec35e361"}

{"abstract": "A structured organization of information is typically required by symbolic processing. On the other hand, most connectionist models assume that data are organized according to relatively poor structures, like arrays or sequences. The framework described in this paper is an attempt to unify adaptive models like artificial neural nets and belief nets for the problem of processing structured information. In particular, relations between data variables are expressed by directed acyclic graphs, where both numerical and categorical values coexist. The general framework proposed in this paper can be regarded as an extension of both recurrent neural networks and hidden Markov models to the case of acyclic graphs. In particular we study the supervised learning problem as the problem of learning transductions from an input structured space to an output structured space, where transductions are assumed to admit a recursive hidden state-space representation. We introduce a graphical formalism for representing this class of adaptive transductions by means of recursive networks, i.e., cyclic graphs where nodes are labeled by variables and edges are labeled by generalized delay elements. This representation makes it possible to incorporate the symbolic and subsymbolic nature of data. Structures are processed by unfolding the recursive network into an acyclic graph called encoding network. In so doing, inference and learning algorithms can be easily inherited from the corresponding algorithms for artificial neural networks or probabilistic graphical model.", "authors": ["Paolo Frasconi", "Marco Gori", "Alessandro Sperduti"], "n_citation": 401, "references": ["02a6abcf-5452-42ec-845f-45f171634d31", "02e0342a-33d3-4d3f-9f1d-b14081edbc39", "0efab1c5-d14a-43ce-af65-d0c268b12a1c", "1035d56c-06b3-40bb-93c7-6306b24bac93", "17dbdda0-164a-4300-beec-8482646fb48f", "20bb3906-8e4c-48ce-8fbd-e6bc3a2dfec9", "225bfe85-e187-49b5-98ed-e89d6793012e", "249ac73a-554f-4024-830b-4e961b3d9636", "29042545-4ddf-4bf9-ae8b-d65876c9eb41", "315b166d-89db-4abd-899d-cbcbd1ecea0c", "31b724c0-ae79-4477-ab75-3b62e2133bdb", "3291e54c-773c-412a-93b0-666345f8499e", "3e097db5-6c17-4c0b-b3b1-ddaa7804f064", "44b2c954-f020-41f7-8ebd-31fe8f695275", "50c2b314-1596-4444-ae9a-606df9899372", "6a685d5e-d656-408a-93c1-0dbe04e67721", "72464d5e-0dbf-45a1-84f7-057bdfc14eda", "756f67c1-6a02-439d-a873-eda27c5d262e", "937614bf-8b42-42ac-8e2b-1359dc5d05b4", "bd20c3c8-f7cc-403d-bf4c-bc5181604608", "bdd72f1c-6df6-4069-bb3a-40a82dfc9065", "c83d82e1-60f1-405c-afdf-0cf72fc85e12", "c9cc3efe-d8e7-4f75-ab07-dc52e85185d9", "cdf60c4f-1a1c-4587-b241-cae92580e667", "d3e00e7e-1c64-4d7a-b2b2-1ad98ba4c706", "d5f20e12-c154-4fb6-b38e-53e00456be22", "e8653df9-4e16-47b8-9cf2-ffa005bac684", "ead57cb0-8e33-41d6-ac0b-917745c62b56", "eb46a6db-a642-49d9-acb2-432d5da7febb", "ed3e89f3-8dfd-4e37-b719-48185570f487"], "title": "A general framework for adaptive processing of data structures", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "year": 1998, "id": "6b962f02-f97d-49a6-8c2c-7e751a2e03a9"}
{"abstract": "We conducted a long-term experiment to compare the costs and benefits of several different software inspection methods. These methods were applied by professional developers to a commercial software product they were creating. Because the laboratory for this experiment was a live development effort, we took special care to minimize cost and risk to the project, while maximizing our ability to gather useful data. This article has several goals: 1) to describe the experiment's design and show how we used simulation techniques to optimize it, 2) to present our results and discuss their implications for both software practitioners and researchers, and 3) to discuss several new questions raised by our findings. For each inspection, we randomly assigned three independent variables: 1) the number of reviewers on each inspection team (1, 2, or 4), 2) the number of teams inspecting the code unit (1 or 2), and 3) the requirement that defects be repaired between the first and second team's inspections. The reviewers for each inspection were randomly selected without replacement from a pool of 11 experienced software developers. The dependent variables for each inspection included inspection interval (elapsed time), total effort, and the defect detection rate. Our results showed that these treatments did not significantly influence the defect detection effectiveness, but that certain combinations of changes dramatically increased the inspection interval.", "authors": ["Adam A.

{"abstract": "The development of Web sites and applications is increasing dramatically to satisfy the market requests. The software industry is facing the new demand under the pressure of a very short time-to-market and an extremely high competition. As a result, Web sites and applications are usually developed without a disciplined process: Web applications are directly coded and no, or poor, documentation is produced to support the subsequent maintenance and evolution activities, thus compromising the quality of the applications. This paper presents a tool for reverse engineering Web applications. UML diagrams are used to model a set of views that depict several aspects of a Web application at different abstraction levels. The recovered diagrams ease the comprehension of the application and support its maintenance and evolution. A case study, carried out with the aim of assessing the effectiveness of the proposed tool, allowed relevant information about some real Web applications to be successfully recovered and modeled by UML diagrams.", "authors": ["G.A.

{"abstract": "We develop a technique to automatically generate a control policy for a robot moving in an environment that includes elements with unknown, randomly changing behavior. The robot is required to achieve a surveillance mission, in which a certain request needs to be serviced repeatedly, while the expected time inbetween consecutive services is minimized and additional temporal logic constraints are satisfied. We define a fragment of linear temporal logic to describe such a mission and formulate the problem as a temporal logic game. Our approach is based on two main ideas. First, we extend results in automata learning to detect patterns of the unknown behavior of the elements in the environment. Second, we employ an automata-theoretic method to generate the control policy. We show that the obtained control policy converges to an optimal one when the partially unknown behavior patterns are fully learned. In addition, we illustrate the method in an experimental setup, in which an unmanned ground vehicle, with the help of a cooperating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), satisfies a temporal logic requirement in a partitioned environment whose regions are controlled by barriers with unknown behavior.", "authors": ["Yushan Chen", "Jana T\u016fmov\u00e1", "Alphan Ulusoy", "Calin Belta"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["0d28b8ef-1979-4613-b961-0f93a8775b72", "10e8157e-963a-44e8-b4f6-f2cf054da376", "252b9e3e-4e30-426b-b4fc-2859b4e5503c", "2c779d6b-fb07-495a-abde-6bc43f23c91e", "3d98b13d-774a-4da7-a2a3-6aa6638f6e8f", "415c28ff-c645-4f18-966d-609a3a6213d8", "4772cd4c-b698-4136-9f08-cb0e9542f83b", "4cc62483-33df-4b52-811a-4d3b6ea38464", "4fb6c772-4a7f-492f-a718-ae431817fb80", "6a5faa5f-e185-42a3-9dc2-3734bffcb5c2", "7752b3a1-2f71-4b60-b7b0-24609d185fec", "7ae70d3d-c36c-4c4f-8ddb-3ad043091487", "a8241231-fffd-493d-ad0c-220961bc00e5", "abc04791-2b81-4ecd-99a8-0d44e8c09b8e", "ba075caf-b351-4294-b0da-c5787a25049c", "e8d7c2f7-1cfa-4323-851c-d282b35f46b4", "edf7359a-79ad-4080-8dff-5020d063baab", "f9cbf223-0cca-47bf-85b2-fd3282b072c4"], "title": "Temporal logic robot control based on automata learning of environmental dynamics", "venue": "The International Journal of Robotics Research", "year": 2013, "id": "3af8e2e4-0dde-4354-bbd8-f9da96cfadec"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, we propose to model an action based on both the shape and the motion of the performing object. When the object performs an action in 3D, the points on the outer boundary of the object are projected as 2D (x, y) contour in the image plane. A sequence of such 2D contours with respect to time generates a spatiotemporal volume (STV) in (x, y, t), which can be treated as 3D object in the (x, y, t) space. We analyze STV by using the differential geometric surface properties to identify action descriptors capturing both spatial and temporal properties. A set of action descriptors is called an action sketch. The first step in our approach is to generate STV by solving the point correspondence problem between consecutive frames. The correspondences are determined using a two-step graph theoretical approach. After the STV is generated, actions descriptors are computed by analyzing the differential geometric properties of STV. Finally, using these descriptors, we perform action recognition, which is also formulated as graph theoretical problem. Several experimental results are presented to demonstrate our approach.", "authors": ["Alper Yilmaz", "Mubarak Shah"], "n_citation": 549, "references": ["042d18d1-aed3-4a9d-ba8b-fb7f3e14f568", "4ee6569d-b939-4a8a-b1f6-637ad87ebee7", "64ff61b0-aecc-408b-9da4-8f2b5defe143", "6e9e4d28-6702-4ee9-874e-50da61638079", "78bc8abc-dd21-47f3-88bd-6103f7307523", "8adc4905-f58c-4bd3-ad73-57948e09b982", "e9939b8b-6fcb-4ded-ac64-43c7fdfb52d6", "ea0481c6-5a8d-40ea-b0d4-a25469d4cd07", "f2fb548d-2b12-45f5-9f9a-91d06607e4dd", "fd4c27c9-7ece-4f02-ab55-f48d8a232fb1"], "title": "Actions sketch: a novel action representation", "venue": "computer vision and pattern recognition", "year": 2005, "id": "8e51224d-8dbb-49e1-8d6a-d3bfaeaf818f"}

{"abstract": "Interaction protocols enable agents to communicate with each other effectively. Whereas several approaches exist to specify interaction protocols, none of them has design tools that can help protocol designers catch semantic protocol errors at design time. As research in networking protocols has shown, flawed specifications of protocols can have disastrous consequences. Hence, it is crucial to systematically analyze protocols in time to ensure effective specification. This paper first studies and formalizes important generic properties of commitment protocols that can ease their effective and consistent development significantly.

Since these properties are formal, they can easily be incorporated in a software tool to (semi-)automate the design and specification of commitment protocols.

{"abstract": "This paper examines a recently addressed practical variant of the capacitated vehicle routing problem (VRP) called the capacitated vehicle routing problem with 3-D loading constraints (3L-CVRP). This problem considers customer demand to be formed by 3-D rectangular items. Additional loading constraints often encountered in real-life applications of transportation logistics are imposed on the examined problem model. In addition to 3L-CVRP, we also introduce and solve a new practical problem version that was dictated by a transportation logistics company and covers cases in which transported items are manually unloaded from the loading spaces of the vehicles. Both problem versions are solved by a hybrid metaheuristic methodology that combines the strategies of tabu search (TS) and guided local search (GLS). The loading characteristics are tackled by employing a collection of packing heuristics. The proposed algorithm's robustness was tested for both problem versions, solving benchmark instances derived from the literature and new benchmark problems with diverse features in terms of customer set size and transported-item dimensions. It produced fine results, improving most of the best solutions that were previously reported.", "authors": ["Christos D. Tarantilis", "Emmanouil E. Zachariadis", "Chris T.

{"abstract": "Wireless data traffic is expected to grow over the next few years and the technologies that will provide data services are still being debated. One possibility is to use multiple antennas at base stations and terminals to get very high spectral efficiencies in rich scattering environments. Such multiple-input/multiple-output (MIMO) channels can then be used in conjunction with scheduling and rate-feedback algorithms to further increase channel throughput. This paper provides an analysis of the expected gains due to scheduling and bits needed for rate feedback. Our analysis requires an accurate approximation of the distribution of the MIMO channel mutual information. Because the exact distribution of the mutual information in a Rayleigh-fading environment is difficult to analyze, we prove a central limit theorem for MIMO channels with a large number of antennas. While the growth in average mutual information (capacity) of a MIMO channel with the number of antennas is well understood, it turns out that the variance of the mutual information can grow very slowly or even shrink as the number of antennas grows. We discuss implications of this \"channel-hardening\" result for data and voice services, scheduling, and rate feedback. We also briefly discuss the implications when shadow fading effects are included.", "authors": ["Bertrand M. Hochwald", "Thomas L.

{"abstract": "Effective resource management of virtualized environments is a challenging task. State-of-the-art management systems either rely on analytical models or evaluate resource allocations by running actual experiments. However, both approaches incur a significant overhead once the workload changes. The former needs to re-calibrate and re-validate models, whereas the latter has to run a new set of experiments to select a new resource allocation. During the adaptation period, the system may run with an inefficient configuration. In this paper, we propose DejaVu - a framework that (1) minimizes the resource management overhead by identifying a small set of workload classes for which it needs to evaluate resource allocation decisions, (2) quickly adapts to workload changes by classifying workloads using signatures and caching their preferred resource allocations at runtime, and (3) deals with interference by estimating an \"interference index\". We evaluate DejaVu by running representative network services on Amazon EC2. DejaVu achieves more than 10x speedup in adaptation time for each workload change relative to the state-of-the-art. By enabling quick adaptation, DejaVu saves up to 60% of the service provisioning cost. Finally, DejaVu is easily deployable as it does not require any extensive instrumentation or human intervention.", "authors": ["Nedeljko Vasic", "Dejan Novakovic", "Svetozar Miucin", "Dejan Kostic", "Ricardo Bianchini"], "n_citation": 164, "references": ["08f93e66-54ba-4cd1-9224-730024fe01b0", "1c0254fa-671c-46ca-93f6-42cbcc58b2ba", "1ca39682-1f12-47f7-accd-d12225035935", "215b9c64-2efc-4639-850c-9c96556ef3c0", "2615c213-8b6d-45cf-91d2-a4100d5d2b58", "2642dd44-4237-4a19-860e-68105ae2b889", "2a25de10-ea33-410c-8f32-69feae4030ab", "30e8196e-3dca-4a13-9824-a427eaa676d1", "37c176ec-503c-4013-a7d9-e2f2d025c6f1", "591e5cbc-0c10-4057-aac8-3808ef69365b", "5fcd132e-7fe1-403a-8a75-9f13eaf2c1ac", "61c3045c-fefa-43ca-8bc7-3b2fc7aa85b8", "724a3668-6dba-4ad4-8ac1-885f6bbea224", "7894c0b5-60b0-4ab9-afc4-3d61a459ec66", "7a457a24-0f5d-4154-9c66-96220a9f58c4", "8026f56a-a93e-4933-8ead-c9aa9e3f0498", "8276500e-fd2a-4398-af87-146975534b51", "84d7a6b9-83b6-4c61-bf68-56557b7c52d4", "90768901-12b5-461b-9a5e-34eff07a7c99", "97b1c38f-5955-4550-b61e-e6960eb51d2f", "a043fd0e-9acb-4588-bd84-575ba57243ec", "aa30892e-6ca2-43ca-a7aa-d16dca5d6862", "ac22f8e8-13ac-452b-b36e-88dc7579a184", "b7841e94-e535-493e-9b7c-060c88c13ff5", "b7c55ddd-55e2-4f00-931c-da2f0ea07bbc", "bc822a4b-02f9-4513-84cc-3084e1b2e747", "c1ab77a0-9da7-4532-b345-fbf7c5bf028b", "e0fe76c0-ebb3-4922-8a02-b0886bf989ed"], "title": "DejaVu: accelerating resource allocation in virtualized environments", "venue": "architectural support for programming languages and operating systems", "year": 2012, "id": "65c318ca-e82d-45cb-be85-3a3be8cad780"}

{"abstract": "A probabilistic method for tracking 3D articulated human figures in monocular image sequences is presented. Within a Bayesian framework, we define a generative model of image appearance, a robust likelihood function based on image graylevel differences, and a prior probability distribution over pose and joint angles that models how humans move. The posterior probability distribution over model parameters is represented using a discrete set of samples and is propagated over time using particle filtering. The approach extends previous work on parameterized optical flow estimation to exploit a complex 3D articulated motion model. It also extends previous work on human motion tracking by including a perspective camera model, by modeling limb self occlusion, and by recovering 3D motion from a monocular sequence. The explicit posterior probability distribution represents ambiguities due to image matching, model singularities, and perspective projection. The method relies only on a frame-to-frame assumption of brightness constancy and hence is able to track people under changing viewpoints, in grayscale image sequences, and with complex unknown backgrounds.", "authors": ["Hedvig Sidenbladh", "Michael J.

They may wrongly estimate the output cardinality of a certain operation and thus make sub-optimal plan choices based on that cardinality.

Automated Statistic Collection (ASC) is a new component in IBM DB2 UDB that, without any DBA intervention, observes and analyzes the effects of faulty statistics and, in response, it triggers actions that continuously repair the latter. In this demonstration, we will show how ASC works to alleviate the DBA from the task of maintaining fresh, accurate statistics in several challenging scenarios. ASC is able to reconfigure the statistics collection parameters (e.g, number of frequent values for a column, or correlations between certain column pairs) on a per-table basis. ASC can also detect and guard against outdated statistics caused by high updates/inserts/deletes rates in volatile, dynamic databases. We will also show how ASC works from the inside: from how cardinality mis-estimations are introduced in different kind of operators, to how this error is propagated to later operations in the plan, to how this influences plan choices inside the optimizer.", "authors": ["Peter J.

In contrast to existing approaches that compile consistency checks into application programs, the approach centralizes consistency enforcement in a separate module called a knowledge-base management system. Exception handlers for constraint violations are represented as rule entities in the knowledge base. For this purpose, a new form of production rule called the activation pattern controlled rule is introduced: in contrast to classical forward chaining schemes, activation pattern controlled rules are triggered by the intent to apply a specific operation but not necessarily by the result of applying this operation. Techniques for implementing this approach are discussed, and experiments in speeding up the system performance are described. Furthermore, an argument is made for more tolerant consistency enforcement strategies, and how they can be integrated into the rule-based approach to consistency enforcement is discussed. >", "authors": ["Christoph F.

{"abstract": "Three Bayesian ideas are presented for supervised adaptive classifiers. First, it is argued that the output of a classifier should be obtained by marginalizing over the posterior distribution of the parameters; a simple approximation to this integral is proposed and demonstrated. This involves a \"moderation\" of the most probable classifier's outputs, and yields improved performance. Second, it is demonstrated that the Bayesian framework for model comparison described for regression models in MacKay (1992a,b) can also be applied to classification problems. This framework successfully chooses the magnitude of weight decay terms, and ranks solutions found using different numbers of hidden units. Third, an information-based data selection criterion is derived and demonstrated within this framework.", "authors": ["David J. C.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we discuss some new bitmap techniques for optimizing decision support queries and association rule algorithm. We first show how to use a new type of predefined bitmap join index (prejoin/spl I.bar/bitmap/spl I.bar/index) to efficiently execute complex decision support queries with multiple outer join operations involved and push the outer join operations from the data flow level to the bitmap level and achieve significant performance gain. Then we discuss a bitmap based association rule algorithm. Our bitmap based association rule algorithm Bit-AssocRule doesn't follow the generation-and-test strategy of a priori algorithm and adopts the divide-and-conquer strategy, thus avoids the time-consuming table scan to find and prune the item sets, all the operations of finding large item sets from the datasets are the fast bit operations. The experimental results show Bit-AssocRule is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude faster than a priori and a priori hybrid algorithms. Our results indicate that bitmap techniques can greatly improve the performance of decision support queries and association rule algorithm, and bitmap techniques are very promising for the decision support query optimization and data mining applications.", "authors": ["Xiaohua Hu", "Tsau Young Lin", "Eric Louie"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["01ae664a-5eb6-4614-9709-bbb27ff2f1cb", "08bb1015-8845-441c-8d8c-d598c98bff1b", "25b7fdf3-e5df-442e-b88b-df07db49f33b", "2609fc6a-75fe-44b7-9906-4b53a6cb80d8", "32796b80-813d-4309-b055-3fefb6327fd7", "3f7cfad1-2ef7-4193-a2d9-95789c64b207", "5f6a6628-6269-4a18-93ca-4af8eb9be971", "66d187d9-e2cf-4f98-aba1-a0f15d4d6e2b", "929abc46-4b62-459b-a972-caa1d09e0fcc", "9660d528-73cf-48d5-a86c-862ad5a34717", "a1749090-e577-45de-86a7-2ecc62c6f092", "a175e9d5-65d6-4d18-ad66-d42f20a76516", "b2b27ecb-b50e-4c2f-995d-4260aad2fe13", "c0420796-2218-47d0-a9ad-a34daab374af", "c3bcc298-687c-4767-b4c4-54af65e3f72f", "c4710c73-497d-44f0-ae10-64613eca18d4", "ca48d368-6b71-41bd-8dcc-f08cb8db9be2", "d4a285fc-0f3a-46ca-939c-52c5dafe0c9f", "e8ab235f-d709-4d84-87d4-c2dba5b73d32"], "title": "Bitmap techniques for optimizing decision support queries and association rule algorithms", "venue": "international database engineering and applications symposium", "year": 2003, "id": "77aef642-30f8-46f0-9b5f-cce764b83f76"}

{"abstract": "Many tools in software engineering projects support the visualization and collaborative modification of custom sets of artifacts. This includes tools for requirements engineering, UML tools for design, project management tools, developer tools and many more. A key factor for success in software engineering projects is the collective understanding of changes applied to these artifacts. To support this, there are several strategies to automatically notify project participants about relevant changes. Known strategies are limited to a fixed set of artifacts and/or make no use of traceability information to supply change notifications. This paper proposes a change notification approach based on traceability in a unified model and building upon operation-based change tracking. The unified model explicitly combines system specification models and project management models into one fully traceable model.

{"abstract": "CLF/Mekano is a distributed object infrastructure oriented towards the high-level coordination of coarse grain components. Unlike other infrastructures of the same class, such as CORBA or DCOM, coordination in CLF/Mekano is built-in at the lowest level, namely at the inter-component communication protocol level, and not as a side service (such as the event, transaction or negotiation services of Corba). Although the CLF protocol is \"lightweight\" (it relies on very few concepts and only 8 communication \"verbs\"), it makes the design and implementation of components more complex, but also more valuable if it can be reused. The Mekano library has been developed in order to deal with this complexity, targeting reusability. It provides ready-to-use generic classes of customizable components, as well as useful component parts which can be reassembled according to application specific needs. Of course, further layers of domain-specific libraries (so called business object libraries), can then be developed on top of Mekano, to provide ready-to-use components dedicated to specific business needs (in the line of Enterprise Java Beans).", "authors": ["Jean-Marc Andreoli", "Damian Arregui", "Fran\u00e7ois Pacull", "Michel Riviere", "Jean-Yves Vion-Dury", "Jutta Willamowski"], "n_citation": 40, "references": ["03ea940d-dba9-40e6-b734-8b08e34021cf", "07abc566-0ce6-48a7-a7cd-238641701f4f", "1735f072-f54a-4cc2-b4ec-bebd4e204e63", "29c278b8-5395-41f0-8ba6-829af28bf298", "3b20c411-6716-483f-b8d1-94a438ee8b69", "4ded438f-e48d-4d6c-912c-f7a8c8207e2d", "768e5c8f-180b-4afc-bf80-254858ab564e"], "title": "CLF/Mekano: a framework for building virtual-enterprise applications", "venue": "enterprise distributed object computing", "year": 1999, "id": "1a9562b2-986c-47df-87ad-49863bd9c29b"}

The goal is to determine the most appropriate workers to assign incoming tasks, in such a way so that the realtime demands are met and high quality results are returned.

{"abstract": "Argumentation represents the study of views and opinions that humans express with the goal of reaching a conclusion through logical reasoning. Since the 1950's, several models have been proposed to capture the essence of informal argumentation in different settings. With the emergence of the Web, and then the Semantic Web, this modeling shifted towards ontologies, while from the development perspective, we witnessed an important increase in Web 2.0 human-centered collaborative deliberation tools. Through a review of more than 150 scholarly papers, this article provides a comprehensive and comparative overview of approaches to modeling argumentation for the Social Semantic Web. We start from theoretical foundational models and investigate how they have influenced Social Web tools. We also look into Semantic Web argumentation models. Finally we end with Social Web tools for argumentation, including online applications combining Web 2.0 and Semantic Web technologies, following the path to a global World Wide Argument Web.", "authors": ["Jodi Schneider", "Tudor Groza", "Alexandre Passant"], "n_citation": 78, "references": ["01597538-966d-44bd-9e75-7e8516d265ef", "03d86f0b-36b5-4229-85a0-3f3cffbf561f", "075b088d-015b-45ea-ab0e-8b9ecba1b186", "0d26789e-4701-4b3a-8538-8161f7cc0e0e", "0eff6a1d-1fc1-43ac-9935-a0c4161d27eb", "114099fe-5e51-4b1b-8065-7eb51062c823", "122acb6b-1537-4ee6-a789-1998a94fb028", "13b35959-59cd-473d-b085-15011f12585d", "16c80581-141c-4a1f-91a3-c5262d40cc01", "170b4661-4b49-4aaf-8f03-625aed8b5e7c", "173bdafe-22e4-4342-b6a3-5063b49327c2", "176ebce9-d481-48cd-a083-d87a0adbaa3a", "1951bb74-50e2-4664-8cff-8d25ee1daa08", "1c7ddbd7-046a-4333-aa6b-c4ce698d6fad", "1d311751-b6c9-40db-b468-313a07e4661c", "220d4c8b-1d0f-45d1-95cc-7a50662bbe77", "25c619d1-4253-41a6-8c05-290b081f7dcc", "27de1639-2f8b-4a7e-a7a6-ef2e633083e2", "2cd8960c-9b89-4c97-bd19-3e8cb5decd20", "2d700678-6487-473e-a6b8-e0d46dbfec4a", "2e1f112b-0e53-4caa-b3c8-41a67ab4d7d9", "35374e77-d49f-4e86-9e0d-c5b2f5eb9b5a", "36b54c7d-7574-4e9c-a8b5-33ea3e4f73b0", "3ac68733-8734-4f48-8200-e50cb03e42a7", "3af6ddb8-3299-46cb-803e-19b951b7535b", "3efa26e5-b15a-46a2-9358-32bcafda7304", "3fe7eb30-aa8b-4704-b90b-c9f94538678f", "4267c287-11ae-410c-9997-3563d9a39173", "4335d540-e211-46e6-a5f8-d866913f2150", "43dc7ab7-4cc7-404a-9e06-27ea213076d4", "44ef32b4-6841-4113-8e67-38f566206be5", "50554fb5-8d58-40db-a3b5-6af3d65ef411", "50a89267-7a4f-46a7-abf2-da148165faf2", "52d367c6-bb55-41c6-9eea-91b1ef862008", "558bbc62-6a1f-40e1-99ea-b42458e0c058", "5814b4f1-b647-4043-b889-f32c6ca6c298", "5a4c5b96-8326-4434-aad1-68db2e592449", "5fde4f31-f8ba-4e81-a7e7-7d9ca35781ac", "6ac296d9-c187-47d9-8d03-8235388e3383", "6d68a95c-58b6-476b-bb7a-f896f2ebc406", "70af7760-1cf4-461f-863b-3c7fc1998b56", "79946337-595f-49bd-8d58-e84be8f4083b", "7cb45f23-65d7-4f94-9ca2-72c23c11d5f2", "7d3726d8-21e5-4321-833d-dfde277c3693", "7e2817cd-990c-4068-9644-d4e8f3283985", "819ae901-8313-4986-bacf-8d1df582e48e", "81fae119-735c-4017-9552-d15a73437065", "82c034c5-c0e2-4789-a4ac-876c1854438a", "83bea0dc-8682-453b-a4c8-f37648a5a00b", "85d8f133-83a3-4d3a-91fa-b871bae53bf5", "88db1a53-899e-49f5-ab2d-6a4fa0bb345c", "89a494d6-1f57-4070-8d02-492a1fab41cf", "89bb1b45-e6e8-43db-84c0-284ee24bba4b", "89e2988b-1e17-4b4b-8123-490e7d489059", "8a5c6070-775a-4443-a6f7-8536eef94c4d", "8bbf9164-7eb8-4ed8-a9e3-12e92de7da2e", "8c970d40-e98c-45ee-a093-42c8b2629b31", "8dfcc07c-135e-4007-ba26-f45268fd9d2f", "91464336-dd4d-441e-802b-81575531a561", "9286209c-3fc9-4bf2-97b4-c6b2790f3618", "93c1d775-feba-4261-b39c-a87588584e18", "957051b0-6b8f-43eb-8a81-f40fa534be27", "967c4540-2fc0-4fbb-b81b-3b1af7d4507d", "977097fa-a399-4a81-bf40-cad2d7079cbc", "9b215a24-f1a2-4bb5-ad1a-f4a14b306033", "9f187008-89b3-4aab-996d-30f35a20246c", "9ff4a38b-e7ec-4452-98b5-a539c06a7ec3", "a2584534-5301-40c8-8810-1d46833875ff", "a6214aa7-fc1b-4fbe-9cf4-c07d59fc8450", "a8a444c3-b8a1-483e-bf3e-d58ad6578a06", "ab6a08d2-4364-408e-a56c-c8a87bfb70cf", "b089a883-f4b8-4115-a67e-d5cb8883231c", "b30d069b-a5a5-4e25-bd4c-47538e6882e2", "b4a71521-5fea-4da5-a868-b2cf249f90ec", "b5778cc3-2095-4960-9626-55d12e075ee3", "b6c8b82a-c485-4724-9d8a-7b06a1372fdb", "b8fde248-60e2-4b5b-b5b7-c3e434154a2d", "bc8994a6-2539-4de9-a91a-b397968d2438", "be2e5f1b-7f9c-4b3a-b28a-a3b1e4e00242", "c00c9d58-06e7-49df-b536-a4d4cf377907", "c1c12511-30b6-4be4-9f8c-147c096af681", "c2e8d288-00d2-46a7-846b-d9c8a7d0f159", "c5b1dce8-138e-47e2-99ea-c3db250c6a53", "c5f3956c-13d4-49d3-a815-4fa95ffc0e92", "cb9e3600-c86a-4ce7-9cae-47882034e924", "d14f9777-dec9-4c4b-9e0e-126954dfc489", "d1939acc-89d3-4615-9e5d-945a38d436d4", "d48d9c73-543b-42ac-bdbd-a5fb1d003378", "d65087b1-6bb2-4a5e-bc07-93f98638384e", "daad3458-3bdf-4721-984d-2b082ca528f4", "df470101-38c5-4866-a7a5-f681b2070677", "e25fa099-e3dd-4448-abe8-9828d887aff4", "e6d8963c-4e5b-41e5-9e61-3fe693a55764", "e96f028e-c688-4f2c-87c2-f85862587f0a", "eb3f6539-779b-4ff4-84a2-0bf0912a3f27", "eb53c0f8-93fc-443e-8c5e-0a042abb2f17", "edeee867-e799-4734-a054-34ef8d09db55", "ee719616-6494-4a70-89ff-604edaec269f", "f105b742-c124-4d2e-aaeb-bd8cc80361be", "f3c9695f-6305-42d8-8cea-498754c93030", "f629f08f-8ba2-44e0-9e5a-c37e84819099", "fdeb5c0b-c5d3-488d-b605-e5fca45b15dc"], "title": "A review of argumentation for the Social Semantic Web", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "bd67d18b-5a80-4f77-b21c-fd426120b690"}

One of the design principles of the MD4-family of hash functions (MD4, MD5, SHA-1, FLIPEMD-160) is to be fast on the 32-bit Intel processors. This paper shows that carefully coded implementations of these hash functions are able to exploit the Pentium's superscalar architecture to its maximum effect: the performance with respect to execution on a non-parallel architecture increases by about 60%. This is an important result in view of the recent claims on the limited data bandwidth of these hash functions. Moreover, it is conjectured that these implementations are very close to optimal. It will also be shown that the performance penalty incurred by non-cached data and endianness conversion is limited, and in the order of 10% of running time.", "authors": ["Antoon Bosselaers", "Ren\u00e9 Govaerts", "Joos Vandewalle"], "n_citation": 120, "references": ["0ab8c0f9-fdba-428d-81a3-da79d759598e", "1bc58807-9604-4524-8d7c-c3fa9e4e531f", "656a573c-a74a-4f14-9387-27de92b80b47", "7b8f7f6c-15d3-4572-a6d3-8140b8f412b8", "b1f90cfe-a3dd-4995-a7cb-722d76ab9d61"], "title": "Fast Hashing on the Pentium", "venue": "international cryptology conference", "year": 1996, "id": "cd194f37-382c-4387-a1bd-89fbf426f714"}
{"abstract": "One vision for Ontario schools is that the use of information and communication technology (ICT) will profoundly change both teaching and learning. Given the diversity of school settings, however, system-wide ICT integration and implementation must necessarily be defined in multiple ways. This paper presents a decision-making framework for guiding the infusion of ICT into different school settings. First, sustainability of the ICT initiative is the identified as the key goal. Next, multiple contextual variables are distilled into five essential qualities. Then, sustainability and the essential elements are combined. The result is a dynamic framework that can be used to identify specific priorities for implementation and strategies for evaluation of ICT initiatives. Finally, it is illustrated how the framework can be used to guide the successful infusion of ICT in any situation, regardless of a school's previous experience with ICT.", "authors": ["Elaine van Melle", "Luigia Cimellaro", "Lyn M.

{"abstract": "Recently model checking representation and search techniques were shown to be efficiently applicable to planning, in particular to non-deterministic planning. Such planning approaches use Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDDS) to encode a planning domain as a non-deterministic finite automaton and then apply fast algorithms from model checking to search for a solution. OBDDS can effectively scale and can provide universal plans for complex planning domains. We are particularly interested in addressing the complexities arising in non-deterministic, multi-agent domains. In this article, we present UMOP, a new universal OBDD-based planning framework for non-deterministic, multi-agent domains. We introduce a new planning domain description language, NADL, to specify non-deterministic, multi-agent domains. The language contributes the explicit definition of controllable agents and uncontrollable environment agents. We describe the syntax and semantics of NADL and show how to build an efficient OBDD-based representation of an NADL description. The UMOP planning system uses NADL and different OBDD-based universal planning algorithms. It includes the previously developed strong and strong cyclic planning algorithms. In addition, we introduce our new optimistic planning algorithm that relaxes optimality guarantees and generates plausible universal plans in some domains where no strong nor strong cyclic solution exists. We present empirical results applying UMOP to domains ranging from deterministic and single-agent with no environment actions to non-deterministic and multi-agent with complex environment actions. UMOP is shown to be a rich and efficient planning system.", "authors": ["Rune M. Jensen", "Manuela M.

{"abstract": "This paper aims at studying the characterization of Dirac-structure edges with wavelet transform, and selecting the suitable wavelet functions to detect them. Three significant characteristics of the local maximum modulus of the wavelet transform with respect to the Dirac-structure edges are presented: (1) slope invariant: the local maximum modulus of the wavelet transform of a Dirac-structure edge is independent on the slope of the edge; (2) grey-level invariant: the local maximum modulus of the wavelet transform with respect to a Dirac-structure edge takes place at the same points when the images with different grey-levels are processed; and (3) width light-dependent: for various widths of the Dirac-structure edge images, the location of maximum modulus of the wavelet transform varies lightly under the certain circumscription that the scale of the wavelet transform is larger than the width of the Dirac-structure edges. It is important, in practice, to select the suitable wavelet functions, according to the structures of edges. For example, Haar wavelet is better to represent brick-like images than other wavelets. A mapping technique is applied in this paper to construct such a wavelet function. In this way, a low-pass function is mapped onto a wavelet function by a derivation operation. In this paper, the quadratic spline wavelet is utilized to characterize the Dirac-structure edges and a novel algorithm to extract the Dirac-structure edges by wavelet transform is also developed.", "authors": ["Yuan Yan Tang", "Lihua Yang", "Jiming Liu"], "n_citation": 66, "references": ["4c580388-7578-4779-a1b5-77847ddbe95d", "4eedf5e2-76a5-4c8c-b07e-e6318b825961", "750e50f9-e801-4cf0-8d4d-c5d071b9590d", "7e7899a6-9d9f-4a1b-a6bd-ac5be828658c", "8fe139e0-838a-4ee8-8e0e-1e6c9fc3f246", "9e15712f-a270-4a8b-99f5-ab2154ad8e57", "bd5acb06-2698-4ce9-a0ae-cbd687e03278", "f3c16c78-af2a-4f51-8498-5067490b3a6b", "f45ed4e8-5cd8-4f58-a820-4becf29767fd"], "title": "Characterization of Dirac-structure edges with wavelet transform", "venue": "systems man and cybernetics", "year": 2000, "id": "030c325e-d0e5-438a-8ce0-32cb71e61a71"}
{"abstract": "Collective decision making involves on the one hand individual mental states such as beliefs, emotions and intentions, and on the other hand interaction with others with possibly different mental states. Achieving a satisfactory common group decision on which all agree requires that such mental states are adapted to each other by social interaction. Recent developments in social neuroscience have revealed neural mechanisms by which such mutual adaptation can be realised. These mechanisms not only enable intentions to converge to an emerging common decision, but at the same time enable to achieve shared underlying individual beliefs and emotions. This paper presents a computational model for such processes. As an application of the model, an agent-based analysis was made of patterns in crowd behaviour, in particular to simulate a real-life incident that took place on May 4, 2010 in Amsterdam. From available video material and witness reports, useful empirical data were extracted. Similar patterns were achieved in simulations, whereby some of the parameters of the model were tuned to the case addressed, and most parameters were assigned default values. The results show the inclusion of contagion of belief, emotion, and intention states of agents results in better reproduction of the incident than non-inclusion.", "authors": ["Tibor Bosse", "Mark Hoogendoorn", "Michel C.

This paper describes the 1.1 implementation which is based on transforming bytecode.

{"abstract": "Recent advances in lithium-ion battery modeling suggest unequal but controlled and carefully timed charging of individual cells by reduce degradation. This paper compares anode-side film formation for a standard equalization scheme versus unequal charging through switches that are controlled by deterministic dynamic programming (DDP) and DDP-inspired heuristic algorithms. A static map for film growth rate is derived from a first-principles battery model adopted from the electrochemical engineering literature. Using this map, we consider two cells that are connected in parallel via relay switches. The key results are the following: 1) optimal unequal and delayed charging indeed reduces film buildup, and 2) a near-optimal state feedback controller can be designed from the DDP solution and film growth rate convexity properties. The simulation results indicate that the heuristic state feedback controller achieves near optimal performance relative to the DDP solution, with significant reduction in film growth compared to charging both cells equally, for several film growth models. Moreover, the algorithms achieve similar film reduction values on the full electrochemical model. These results correlate with the convexity properties of the film growth map. Hence, this paper demonstrates that unequal charging may indeed reduce film growth, given certain convexity properties exist, lending promise to the concept for improving battery pack life.", "authors": ["Scott J.

{"abstract": "Attackers often create systems that automatically rewrite and reorder their malware to avoid detection. Typical machine learning approaches, which learn a classifier based on a handcrafted feature vector, are not sufficiently robust to such reorderings. We propose a different approach, which, similar to natural language modeling, learns the language of malware spoken through the executed instructions and extracts robust, time domain features. Echo state networks (ESNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are used for the projection stage that extracts the features. These models are trained in an unsupervised fashion. A standard classifier uses these features to detect malicious files. We explore a few variants of ESNs and RNNs for the projection stage, including Max-Pooling and Half-Frame models which we propose. The best performing hybrid model uses an ESN for the recurrent model, Max-Pooling for non-linear sampling, and logistic regression for the final classification. Compared to the standard trigram of events model, it improves the true positive rate by 98.3% at a false positive rate of 0.1%.", "authors": ["Razvan Pascanu", "Jack W.

{"abstract": "The overall objective in defining feature space is to reduce the dimensionality of the original pattern space, whilst maintaining discriminatory power for classification. To meet this objective in the context of ear biometrics a new force field transformation treats the image as an array of mutually attracting particles that act as the source of a Gaussian force field. Underlying the force field there is a scalar potential energy field, which in the case of an ear takes the form of a smooth surface that resembles a small mountain with a number of peaks joined by ridges. The peaks correspond to potential energy wells and to extend the analogy the ridges correspond to potential energy channels. Since the transform also turns out to be invertible, and since the surface is otherwise smooth, information theory suggests that much of the information is transferred to these features, thus confirming their efficacy. We previously described how field line feature extraction, using an algorithm similar to gradient descent, exploits the directional properties of the force field to automatically locate these channels and wells, which then form the basis of characteristic ear features. We now show how an analysis of the mechanism of this algorithmic approach leads to a closed analytical description based on the divergence of force direction, which reveals that channels and wells are really manifestations of the same phenomenon. We further show that this new operator, with its own distinct advantages, has a striking similarity to the Marr-Hildreth operator, but with the important difference that it is non-linear. As well as addressing faster implementation, invertibility, and brightness sensitivity, the technique is also validated by performing recognition on a database of ears selected from the XM2VTS face database, and by comparing the results with the more established technique of Principal Components Analysis. This confirms not only that ears do indeed appear to have potential as a biometric, but also that the new approach is well suited to their description, being robust especially in the presence of noise, and having the advantages that the ear does not need to be explicitly extracted from the background.", "authors": ["David J.

Tanese found that the DGA outperformed the canonical serial genetic algorithm (CGA) on a class of difficult, randomly-generated Walsh polynomials. This left open the question of whether the DGA would have similar success on functions that were more amenable to optimization by the CGA. In this work, experiments were done to compare the DGA's performance on the Royal Road class of fitness functions to that of the CGA. Besides achieving superlinear speedup on KSR parallel computers, the DGA again outperformed the CGA on the functions R3 and R4 with regard to the metrics of best fitness, average fitness, and number of times the optimum was reached. Its performance on R1 and R2 was comparable to that of the CGA. The effect of varying the DGA's migration parameters was also investigated.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we review the basic mechanisms used in packet networks to support Quality-of-Service QoS guarantees. We outline the various approaches that have been proposed, and discuss some of the trade-offs they involve. Specifically, the paper starts by introducing the different scheduling and buffer management mechanisms that can be used to provide service differentiation in packet networks. The aim is not to provide an exhaustive review of existing mechanisms, but instead to give the reader a perspective on the range of options available and the associated trade-off between performance, functionality, and complexity. This is then followed by a discussion on the use of such mechanisms to provide specific end-to-end performance guarantees. The emphasis of this second part is on the need for adapting mechanisms to the different environments where they are to be deployed. In particular, fine grain buffer management and scheduling mechanisms may be neither necessary nor cost effective in high speed backbones, where ''aggregate'' solutions are more appropriate. The paper discusses issues and possible approaches to allow coexistence of different mechanisms in delivering end-to-end guarantees. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

{"abstract": "Textual passwords are often the only mechanism used to authenticate users of a networked system. Unfortunately, many passwords are easily guessed or cracked. In an attempt to strengthen passwords, some systems instruct users to create mnemonic phrase-based passwords. A mnemonic password is one where a user chooses a memorable phrase and uses a character (often the first letter) to represent each word in the phrase.In this paper, we hypothesize that users will select mnemonic phrases that are commonly available on the Internet, and that it is possible to build a dictionary to crack mnemonic phrase-based passwords. We conduct a survey to gather user-generated passwords. We show the majority of survey respondents based their mnemonic passwords on phrases that can be found on the Internet, and we generate a mnemonic password dictionary as a proof of concept. Our 400,000-entry dictionary cracked 4% of mnemonic passwords; in comparison, a standard dictionary with 1.2 million entries cracked 11% of control passwords. The user-generated mnemonic passwords were also slightly more resistant to brute force attacks than control passwords. These results suggest that mnemonic passwords may be appropriate for some uses today. However, mnemonic passwords could become more vulnerable in the future and should not be treated as a panacea.", "authors": ["Cynthia Kuo", "Sasha Romanosky", "Lorrie Faith Cranor"], "n_citation": 205, "references": ["66eed429-bc29-42c9-976f-9bf61683a13f", "8eda006e-ff70-4fbe-a404-86bb3613906e", "fbdb7d7f-c575-4a89-9e5e-153765688177"], "title": "Human selection of mnemonic phrase-based passwords", "venue": "symposium on usable privacy and security", "year": 2006, "id": "5616b234-e800-43dc-bd34-6c35b8c59eef"}
{"abstract": "Ambient intelligence opens up a world of unprecedented experiences. The interaction of people with electronic devices will change as context awareness, natural interfaces, and ubiquitous availability of information come to fruition. Ambient intelligence is going to impose major challenges on multimedia research. Distributed multimedia applications and their processing on embedded static and mobile platforms will play a major role in the development of ambient-intelligent environments. The requirements that ambient-intelligent multimedia applications impose on the mechanisms users apply to interact with media call for paradigms substantially different from contemporary interaction concepts. The complexity of media will continually increase in terms of volume and functionality, thus introducing a need for simplicity and ease of use. Therefore, the massively distributed, integrated use of media will require replacing well-known interaction vehicles, such as remote control and menu-driven search and control, with novel more intuitive, and natural concepts. This article reviews the concept of ambient intelligence and elaborates on its relation with multimedia. (The \"Advances in media processing\" sidebar gives insight into the developments that have set the stage for this new step forward.) The emphasis is on qualitative aspects, highlighting those elements that play a role in realizing ambient intelligence. Multimedia processing techniques and applications are key to realizing ambient intelligence, and they introduce major challenges to the design and implementation of both media-processing platforms and multimedia applications. Technology will not be the limiting factor in realizing ambient intelligence. The ingredients to let the computers disappear are already available, but the true success of the paradigm will depend on the ability to develop concepts that allow natural interaction with digital environments. We must build these digital environments with the invisible technology of the forthcoming century. The role of intelligent algorithms in this respect is apparent because it is the key enabling factor for realizing natural interaction.", "authors": ["Emile H. L.

{"abstract": "Boolean satisfiability (SAT) and maximum satisfiability (Max-SAT) are difficult combinatorial problems that have many important real-world applications. In this paper, we first investigate the configuration landscapes of local minima reached by the WalkSAT local search algorithm, one of the most effective algorithms for SAT. A configuration landscape of a set of local minima is their distribution in terms of quality and structural differences relative to an optimal or a reference solution. Our experimental results show that local minima from WalkSAT form large clusters, and their configuration landscapes constitute big valleys, in that high quality local minima typically share large partial structures with optimal solutions. Inspired by this insight into WalkSAT and the previous research on phase transitions and backbones of combinatorial problems, we propose and develop a novel method that exploits the configuration landscapes of such local minima. The new method, termed as backbone-guided search, can be embedded in a local search algorithm, such as WalkSAT, to improve its performance. Our experimental results show that backbone-guided local search is effective on overconstrained random Max-SAT instances. Moreover, on large problem instances from a SAT library (SATLIB), the backbone guided WalkSAT algorithm finds satisfiable solutions more often than WalkSAT on SAT problem instances, and obtains better solutions than WalkSAT on Max-SAT problem instances, improving solution quality by 20% on average.", "authors": ["Weixiong Zhang"], "n_citation": 82, "references": ["1d28cef6-0b24-439b-9641-74b8ee3b3076", "22d51954-b6ec-477a-b37e-4c915eb35957", "24368035-5db2-4d01-b231-75582d8f7d0a", "288dce14-855c-4502-a7d2-cbc4dee2a31e", "2cff0cf6-8a6d-494f-9b04-66ecb59afeac", "45147d7b-255d-45e0-85c6-5646b1f039c7", "5aa7a001-6729-419c-a8e2-d8564dedaf06", "7303f5df-2a0d-40bf-bd56-ff82f6a5da32", "859b0b38-b9a5-4729-b9e8-70a86932125c", "8d09527f-b5ad-4902-ba34-5583f6759d3b", "936b1de5-a629-46d7-9823-3199fa00a597", "9a116e60-b816-413a-a801-b234c3d81a46", "a3cbfca5-e5fa-436b-9787-c297a516b805", "b5edf6d3-9177-4c78-aaf8-6171992fafaf", "cf7f48dd-fc88-4f47-8f8e-f7b24e5de011", "ddadbc65-cede-4b72-a049-f2578c03ffa7", "e8df1a74-0e2f-475a-ad50-33d398d89150", "f01c2813-d7ba-413e-ab79-f613842e71ac", "f783b3e1-e154-4c94-a736-e6bc41d1a0cd", "f7c96e3b-1ed5-42c3-b6a3-42bd56d2ea2c"], "title": "Configuration landscape analysis and backbone guided local search: part I: Satisfiability and maximum satisfiability", "venue": "Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2004, "id": "d462d883-ca9c-4abd-81ad-1979efa4b9b0"}
{"abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a security framework for  practical and lightweight domain isolation  on Android to mitigate unauthorized data access and communication among applications of different trust levels (e.g., private and corporate). We present the design and implementation of our framework,  TrustDroid , which in contrast to existing solutions enables isolation at different layers of the Android software stack: (1) at the middleware layer to prevent inter-domain application communication and data access, (2) at the kernel layer to enforce mandatory access control on the file system and on Inter-Process Communication (IPC) channels, and (3) at the network layer to mediate network traffic. For instance, (3) allows network data to be only read by a particular domain, or enables basic context-based policies such as preventing Internet access by untrusted applications while an employee is connected to the company's network.   Our approach accurately addresses the demands of the business world, namely to isolate data and applications of different trust levels in a practical and lightweight way.

{"abstract": "Cloud computing represents a novel on-demand computing approach where resources are provided in compliance to a set of predefined non-functional properties specified and negotiated by means of Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In order to avoid costly SLA violations and to timely react to failures and environmental changes, advanced SLA enactment strategies are necessary, which include appropriate resource-monitoring concepts. Currently, Cloud providers tend to adopt existing monitoring tools, as for example those from Grid environments. However, those tools are usually restricted to locality and homogeneity of monitored objects, are not scalable, and do not support mapping of low-level resource metrics e.g., system up and down time to high-level application specific SLA parameters e.g., system availability. In this paper we present a novel framework for managing the mappings of the Low-level resource Metrics to High-level SLAs (LoM2HiS framework). The LoM2HiS framework is embedded into FoSII infrastructure, which facilitates autonomic SLA management and enforcement. Thus, the LoM2HiS framework detects future SLA violation threats and can notify the enactor component to act so as to avert the threats. We discuss the conceptual model of the LoM2HiS framework, followed by the implementation details.

{"abstract": "A rapidly growing elder population is placing unprecedented demands on health care systems around the world. Cognitive decline is one of the most taxing health problems in terms of both its relation to elders' overall functioning and the cost of care. The needs of elders with cognitive decline - for invisible, intuitive support and assessment - invite a reconsideration of the assumptions behind and specifications for ubiquitous computing solutions. This paper describes findings and implications of ethnographic research conducted with cognitively impaired individuals and their informal care networks in 45 households in 5 U.S. regions. Key themes regarding needs and barriers to successful aging are addressed through a set of design principles which apply across the stages of cognitive decline. To convey stage-specific findings and associated challenges for ubiquitous computing, case studies of four representative households and example concept solutions are presented.

{"abstract": "Summary form only given. The wide deployment of Internet technology has resulted in exponential growth in Internet application services (e.g., content hosting for data with Web-based access, shared payroll applications, firewall-based security services, email and shared file services). The management and control of these application services is a challenging research problem due to the huge amount of data that needs to be collected and coordinated, the heterogeneity and the independence of resources and components required by these services and the fact that they run under different organizations and administration policies. This complexity has led to a situation where the cost to manage such systems is actually a lot more than the actual systems themselves. Consequently, the growing complexity of the IT infrastructure threatens to undermine the very benefits information technology aims to provide. A potential solution to these challenging research problems is autonomic computing that calls for designing distributed information systems that can automatically configure, deploy, secure, tolerate faults, optimize, and anticipate loads by themselves without the manual involvement of human administrators. This approach has been inspired by the human autonomic nervous system that has the ability to self-configure, self-tune and even repair themselves without any human conscience involvement. The concept of developing the next era of computing systems is driven by the convergence between the biological systems and the digital computing systems. In this paper, the author reviews the basic principles of autonomic computing, related research projects in industry and academia and future research directions and opportunities. In addition, the author describes our on-going research projects to develop autonomia: an autonomic control and management environment.", "authors": ["Salim Hariri"], "n_citation": 50, "title": "Autonomic computing: research challenges and opportunities", "venue": "international conference on pervasive services", "year": 2004, "id": "dbc9003f-99ea-4121-a875-57aa982f17b5"}

{"abstract": "Prior research suggests that predicting defect-inducing changes, i.e., Just-In-Time (JIT) defect prediction is a more practical alternative to traditional defect prediction techniques, providing immediate feedback while design decisions are still fresh in the minds of developers. Unfortunately, similar to traditional defect prediction models, JIT models require a large amount of training data, which is not available when projects are in initial development phases. To address this flaw in traditional defect prediction, prior work has proposed cross-project models, i.e., models learned from older projects with sufficient history. However, cross-project models have not yet been explored in the context of JIT prediction. Therefore, in this study, we empirically evaluate the performance of JIT cross-project models. Through a case study on 11 open source projects, we find that in a JIT cross-project context: (1) high performance within-project models rarely perform well; (2) models trained on projects that have similar correlations between predictor and dependent variables often perform well; and (3) ensemble learning techniques that leverage historical data from several other projects (e.g., voting experts) often perform well. Our findings empirically confirm that JIT cross-project models learned using other projects are a viable solution for projects with little historical data. However, JIT cross-project models perform best when the data used to learn them is carefully selected.", "authors": ["Takafumi Fukushima", "Yasutaka Kamei", "Shane McIntosh", "Kazuhiro Yamashita", "Naoyasu Ubayashi"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["11df7d57-bad8-4b0b-8ce8-e26c6d9eb2b0", "12d0dbd4-4dd9-42b7-a321-14270882a619", "130b92c3-7101-4905-8272-f583892623a3", "1d2aed09-fa6d-4e82-923a-2d5dc495e8f2", "2068a31e-93c4-497f-ad79-c0ca3bf88ab8", "21ffae8e-2406-4e5e-b1e1-e6a0f9a82bf1", "30dc509d-e502-4e26-9942-913501b90f65", "3224bbd4-99f7-4b1f-b177-9cdf4b093f59", "32496c5a-28fd-4b33-88c3-3501c2a88fe4", "3ada16b7-35f3-4c44-aa30-53c252ec92d8", "49db2c46-9185-44c9-b46b-acd05f69d07d", "53ce6ee3-31f1-48ca-9881-f82209a2f949", "55b0c3cc-fc6d-41d4-9fd1-7c379856c40c", "57af1f08-da6a-466f-97a2-99e98a992768", "59b96af2-9216-466d-960a-9195894e872f", "68ace25b-3db2-4172-b084-f2c0cb154849", "7c790617-fc17-43ce-920c-f626acea1330", "9605fd6e-63a8-44fd-b9a7-63e6cddf5a30", "a1853113-dd04-44ae-9e76-a0ddfbf49084", "ab7e74af-c2d1-48bc-827e-32df6027649c", "abed179f-56b3-4cc6-975d-7177f879b97e", "acdc9d28-c847-4614-b133-9a9fe99e7da9", "b8814355-a7a0-4609-a346-e519a3247018", "cb5f2654-bbe6-46da-8812-29fa13b8488c", "ce1de14a-719d-41ca-9569-b882ce817195", "d2c0bb3b-27f9-4ba0-b5b3-d988a8ec8129", "d57ce87d-cc87-4efe-bdb7-dc3f33d87aed", "e1eafa95-f084-4768-b8be-f8a35d77beba", "e3654d9b-7694-4e79-9f63-8b8dd913ddbd", "e604ea58-c9a0-4166-b48c-7d055c4da401", "eca32749-50ca-4b9a-ad71-5d2916388e31", "f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6", "fe68e006-ce24-4ec6-8977-c602a6ef1ac8"], "title": "An empirical study of just-in-time defect prediction using cross-project models", "venue": "mining software repositories", "year": 2014, "id": "3b9cf7d4-4816-48bd-89b9-63a986c2e58d"}
{"abstract": "Modula-3 supports development of modular programs by separating an object's interface from its implementation. This separation induces a runtime overhead in the implementation of objects, because it prevents the compiler from having complete information about a program's type hierarchy. This overhead can be reduced at link time, when the entire type hierarchy becomes available. We describe opportunities for link-time optimization of Modula-3, present two link-time optimizations that reduce the runtime costs of Modula-3's opaque types and methods, and show how link-time optimization could provide C++ which the benefits of opaques types at no additional runtime cost.  Our optimization techniques are implemented in mld, a retargetable linker for the MIPS, SPARC, and Intel 486, mld links a machine-independent intermediate code that is suitable for link-time optimization and code generation. Linking intermediate code simplifies implementation of the optimizations and makes it possible to evaluate them on a wide range of architectures. mld's optimizations are effective: they reduce the total number of instructions executed by up to 14% and convert as many as 79% of indirect calls to direct calls.", "authors": ["Mary Fernandez"], "n_citation": 175, "references": ["06de689e-7562-46cc-a05e-df6ed8733eeb", "0e9a95d8-7550-4a64-9eb9-1bcfd297a2e2", "101e7f2c-4cff-4114-8777-715188f8e2a9", "311f2a11-5edf-4f5e-96ca-906adad4e768", "465ab456-686e-4adc-bfac-1806531cb926", "4899b82e-536c-416e-8be6-b89b9f3f414c", "5e5d4168-e928-4ab6-87d5-9ba657a94011", "6785d04c-cdac-441b-a8aa-d45891ff87fc", "73306e9f-9e86-4cfb-a099-77721d9c0dc5", "7a5a7dd3-8390-448d-828b-6fd993913c6c", "87cf7459-b999-4d56-91b3-bb426b49dc3b", "b7be3b99-0d0e-4fb0-b644-f9a429794192", "bbf87531-93e1-4714-b861-31c0fe383e6e", "dea6d574-254f-4097-9a95-74cc01db7154", "e823c0b4-3d97-4720-8258-abc73d634472", "ecf0f0f7-1fe9-4b2a-9957-7fbadbf914b4", "efc810fe-0b99-4e5f-87c6-984f064d8796", "fba244e2-43cc-4b78-b754-5adabeaa8cf8", "ff9d677d-bfa2-4d00-87a9-9d14402c7236"], "title": "Simple and effective link-time optimization of Modula-3 programs", "venue": "programming language design and implementation", "year": 1995, "id": "6f9e1a29-ac8b-45b7-862d-ade5ecfe4a07"}

{"abstract": "The best-known algorithm for the satisfiability problem in the case of propositional formulae (SAT) is the implicit enumeration version of the Davis\u2013Putnam algorithm, as described in Loveland's book. We review this algorithm, which we call DPL, and some recent variants. As it is often the case with enumerative algorithms for decision type problems, neither DPL nor its variants incorporate any effective device to prune the search tree. We investigate the idea of using the solution of related subproblems as such a pruning device. It is well known that HORN-SAT, the satisfiability problem in the case of Horn clauses, is easy: in fact an algorithm, DG, has been proposed by Dowling and Gallier, which solves HORN-SAT in linear time. Here we show by means of a set of experiments that the efficiency of DG is not only theoretical but practical as well. In fact we show that on a set of randomly generated problems the complexity of DG grows almost linearly with the problem size, while, for instance, the complexity of the unit resolution approach grows almost quadratically. Then we propose two relaxation schemes which map instances of SAT into instances of HORN-SAT; such relaxation schemes are used to derive two new enumerative algorithms for SAT: HORN1 and HORN2. These algorithms have been compared experimentally with DPL and with its variants. Our results show that HORN2 outperforms the other algorithms; in particular it runs several times faster than DPL on almost all the test problems we have generated.", "authors": ["Giorgio Gallo", "Giampaolo Urbani"], "n_citation": 115, "references": ["06147540-85a1-461f-8f1f-8ae457f8c15d", "1c62929b-f0b8-48c9-a2ad-d9b22398f588", "4319c05c-7a36-478c-9f9a-70d062f2b1a3", "5dff42ad-e16b-4b6a-bce3-fe808d109177", "621a09e2-30e3-4ad9-a568-b617a10e03b0", "8d09527f-b5ad-4902-ba34-5583f6759d3b", "c0a69970-4b14-492a-adcc-6928988a9f2a", "dc153ac2-64d0-47ea-a1ef-dc070c6cd3fb", "e912607f-45a9-4eca-a24d-f03cbcaf1185"], "title": "Algorithms for testing the satisfiability of propositional formulae", "venue": "Journal of Logic Programming", "year": 1989, "id": "eac99844-bd72-4368-acf8-fc4b8db0b0d4"}
{"abstract": "In recent years, a number of applications of ad-hoc networks have been proposed. Many of them are based on the availability of a robust and reliable multicast protocol. We address the issue of reliability and propose a scalable method to improve packet delivery of multicast routing protocols and decrease the variation in the number of packets received by different nodes. The proposed protocol works in two phases. In the first phase, any suitable protocol is used to multicast a message to the group, while in the second concurrent phase, the gossip protocol tries to recover lost messages. Our proposed gossip protocol is called Anonymous Gossip (AG) since nodes need not know the other group members for gossip to be successful. This is extremely desirable for mobile nodes, that have limited resources, and where the knowledge of group membership is difficult to obtain. As a first step, anonymous gossip is implemented over MAODV without much overhead and its performance is studied. Simulations show that the packet delivery of MAODV is significantly improved and the variation in number of packets delivered is decreased.", "authors": ["Ranveer Chandra", "Venugopalan Ramasubramanian", "Kenneth P.

{"abstract": "Composite systems are generally comprised of heterogeneous components whose specifications are developed by many development participants. The requirements of such systems are invariably elicited from multiple perspectives that overlap, complement, and contradict each other. Furthermore, these requirements are generally developed and specified using multiple methods and notations, respectively. It is therefore necessary to express and check the relationships between the resultant specification fragments. We deploy multiple ViewPoints that hold partial requirements specifications, described and developed using different representation schemes and development strategies. We discuss the notion of inter-ViewPoint communication in the context of this ViewPoints framework, and propose a general model for ViewPoint interaction and integration. We elaborate on some of the requirements for expressing and enacting inter-ViewPoint relationships-the vehicles for consistency checking and inconsistency management. Finally, though we use simple fragments of the requirements specification method CORE to illustrate various components of our work, we also outline a number of larger case studies that we have used to validate our framework. Our computer-based ViewPoints support environment, The Viewer, is also briefly described. >", "authors": ["Bashar Nuseibeh", "Jeff Kramer", "Anthony Finkelstein"], "n_citation": 713, "references": ["0ac9b5d2-520e-4c2d-8f95-51e2d828efae", "176c4aaa-f2c1-4d30-bf5d-d39b5ada43ff", "1ea3d8c3-1697-4206-9ffe-191b325d9fa1", "213706f1-1db4-426c-b052-d00212d08969", "37260f82-4337-47d0-b9be-7a7ecc3e35a9", "3a07e7e1-87eb-451c-bfcf-f7fe28637b0a", "3a30887f-011a-401a-a8c5-3523218ca2ad", "3aa24bd7-7105-4e74-8184-e5a7bec93b8a", "3ddb787c-bc52-47a1-9133-92457a4cf869", "412e14c2-7589-4207-bbcb-42e108f6808b", "43e74ea3-85e6-42af-9109-e6b4665c5b84", "54a5de70-41c6-4a09-8d96-d02e31438725", "56b146fa-f8f1-4c87-ae29-5da4567b5ca0", "626243a7-eb16-4150-918d-bacfdb5c95d9", "69220232-821f-4e21-8d99-3decfb2f9da6", "7f3b2504-91a6-4eb6-ad98-d755669367b2", "866143b9-2298-4e6f-ad48-aeeae285f7a1", "9027b908-a1fe-4126-bf1f-9c56e827af71", "96b8adae-a450-46f2-b13f-3ca7df0db447", "9c9dee20-98c6-43a6-93af-582bba82e14e", "a4b73295-159c-42fb-b2a1-f0961caa5a5c", "af990493-a799-42d6-baec-7c547d07738b", "b0fc4a2a-4474-4ad0-9cfb-a9b5805b275f", "e7ca075d-fbaf-4369-b489-f48224959777", "f7a4a2a4-d53f-48dc-9680-e10afb169832", "f80b3fe3-2108-4f99-b862-a1ef893029ec"], "title": "A framework for expressing the relationships between multiple views in requirements specification", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "year": 1994, "id": "216b40cd-fe3c-405d-97c9-f3d1ea9eb870"}

{"abstract": "Computation of good viewpoints is important in several fields: computational geometry, visual servoing, robot motion, graph drawing, etc. In addition, selection of good views is rapidly becoming a key issue in computer graphics due to the new techniques of Image Based Rendering. Although there is no consensus about what a good view means in Computer Graphics, the quality of a viewpoint is intuitively related to how much information it gives us about a scene. In this paper we use the theoretical basis provided by Information Theory to define a new measure, viewpoint entropy, that allows us to compute good viewing positions automatically. We also show how it can be used to select a set of good views of a scene for scene understanding.

{"abstract": "In almost any other field than software development, the World Wide Web, or simply the Web has revolutionized collaboration by providing a platform for cooperative applications and services. In contrast, so far revision control, also referred to as version management, has been the key technology for enabling collaborative software development. However, even today it is feasible to build a cooperative development environment that runs in a cloud, following the spirit of Google Docs, where developers can cooperate in real time. In this paper, we take a step beyond from the design of the technical artifact that allows collaborative coding, and consider the consequences of such an approach to software development in a more general sense, in particular from the perspective of version management. The goal is to integrate collaborative development with traditional facilities commonly associated with software engineering.

Exact location is the relation between an object and the region of space it occupies. The notion of part location characterizes relations between parts of objects and parts of regions of space. The notion of rough location characterizes the location of a spatial object within a set of regions which form a regional partition of space. It links parts of spatial objects to parts of partition elements. The relationships between rough location, vague defined spatial objects, and indeterminacy of location are discussed. Knowledge about location of spatial objects in physical reality is based on observation and measurement.

{"abstract": "We study the problem of video shot boundary detection using an adaptive edge-oriented framework. Our approach is distinct in its use of multiple multilevel features in the required processing. Adaptation is provided by a careful analysis of these multilevel features, based on shot variability. We consider three levels of adaptation: at the feature extraction stage using locally-adaptive edge maps, at the video sequence level, and at the individual shot level. We show how to provide adaptive parameters for the multilevel edge-based approach, and how to determine adaptive thresholds for the shot boundaries based on the characteristics of the particular shot being indexed. The result is a fast adaptive scheme that provides a slightly better performance in terms of robustness, and a five fold efficiency improvement in shot characterization and classification. The reported work has applications beyond direct video indexing, and could be used in real-time applications, such as in dynamic monitoring and modeling of video data traffic in multimedia communications, and in real-time video surveillance.

{"abstract": "When a quantum system interacts with its environment, the so-called decoherence effect will normally destroy the coherence in the quantum state and the entanglement between its subsystems. We propose a feedback control strategy based on quantum weak measurements to protect coherence and entanglement of the quantum state against environmental disturbance. For a one-qubit quantum system under amplitude damping and dephasing decoherence channels, our strategy can preserve the coherence based on the measured information about the population difference between its two levels. For a two-qubit quantum system disentangled by independent amplitude damping and dephasing decoherence channels, the designed feedback control can preserve coherence between the ground state and the highest excited states by tuning the coupling strength between the two qubits, and at the same time minimize the loss of entanglement between the two qubits.

Inductively defined FM-sets involving this name abstraction set former (together with cartesian product and disjoint union) can correctly encode object-level syntax module e-conversion. In this way, the standard theory of algebraic data types can be extended to encompass signatures involving binding operators.

However, in order to fully exploit the capability of directional antennas, whenever a source and a destination engage in a communication, all the neighbors of source and destination nodes should know the direction of communication so that they can initiate new communication in other directions, thus preventing interference with on-going data communication. In our adaptive MAC protocol, each node keeps certain neighborhood information dynamically so that each node can keep a track of the direction of communication events going on in its neighborhood at that instant of time. Moreover, appropriate mechanisms for null steering of directional antennas in user terminals can help exchange the neighborhood information in the presence of on-going communication and can drastically improve the medium utilization through overlapping communications in different directions.", "authors": ["Somprakash Bandyopadhyay", "Kazuo Hasuike", "Sakae Horisawa", "Satoshi Tawara"], "n_citation": 102, "references": ["04d08d28-706c-492a-b2a2-68be407e3ce4", "7c9f8cd8-d0ef-4954-b4db-4a6c803459c2", "7f7fd004-7853-4c6c-b120-e9a9b9ea4821", "ccabb476-c38d-4867-bf93-60f1abe6e95b", "fb2003f6-ed7b-424e-94b2-6b150f8e7302"], "title": "An adaptive MAC protocol for wireless ad hoc community network (WACNet) using electronically steerable passive array radiator antenna", "venue": "global communications conference", "year": 2001, "id": "929b073c-cb7d-4ec8-ab16-eb747165b94b"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents numerical studies of analyses of the limit cycle of the reaction control system (RCS) and their validations through hardware-in-the-loop simulation (HILS). The numerical analyses under external disturbance and time-delays of the thruster are confirmed experimentally by HILS for an attitude control system with a single degree of freedom. The thrust of each jet thruster is determined from offline vacuum test results instead of actual thrust measurement. The comparison of HILS results with numerical analysis, shows that predicted properties of the limit cycle is closed to the test results, thus it can be applicable to real RCS.

{"abstract": "Implementing a custom hardware is not always feasible due to cost and time considerations. No instruction set computer (NISC) architecture is one of the promising direction to design a custom datapath for each application using its execution characteristics. A major challenge with NISC control word is that they tend to be at least 4 to 5 times larger than regular instruction size, thereby imposing higher memory requirement. A promising approach is to compress these control words to reduce the code size of the application. This article proposes an efficient bitmask-based compression technique to drastically reduce the control word size while keeping the decompression overhead minimal. The main contributions of our approach are: i) efficient don't care resolution for maximum bitmask coverage using limited dictionary entries, ii) run length encoding to significantly reduce repetitive control words, and iii) smart encoding of constant and less frequently changing bits.

{"abstract": "The paper describes use of soft computing methods (fuzzy logic and neural network techniques) in the development of a hybrid fuzzy neural control (HFNC) scheme for a multi-link flexible manipulator. A manipulator with multiple flexible links is a multivariable system of considerable complexity due to the inter-link coupling effects that are present in both rigid and flexible motions. Modelling and controlling the dynamics of such manipulators is therefore difficult. The proposed HFNC scheme generates control actions combining contributions form both a fuzzy controller and a neural controller. The primary loop of the proposed HFNC contains a fuzzy controller and a neural network controller in the secondary loop to compensate for the coupling effects due to the rigid and flexible motion along with the inter-link coupling. It has been ascertained from the present investigation that the proposed soft-computing-based controller works effectively in the tracking control of such a multi-link flexible manipulator.

{"abstract": "Program dependence graphs have been proposed for use in optimizing, vectorizing, and parallelizing compilers, and for program integration. This paper proposes their use as the basis for  incremental program testing  when using  test data adequacy criteria . Test data adequacy is commonly used to provide some confidence that a particular test suite does a reasonable job of testing a program. Incremental program testing using test data adequacy criteria addresses the problem of testing a modified program given an adequate test suite for the original program. Ideally, one would like to create an adequate test suite for the modified program that reuses as many files from the old test suite as possible. Furthermore, one would like to know, for every file that is in both the old and the new test suites, whether the program components exercised by that file have been affected by the program modification; if no components have been affected, then it is not necessary to rerun the program using that file.  In this paper we define adequacy criteria based on the program dependence graph, and propose techniques based on program slicing to identify components of the modified program that can be tested using files from the old test suite, and components that have been affected by the modification. This information can be used to reduce the time required to create new test files, and to avoid unproductive retesting of unaffected components.

{"abstract": "Nodes in mobile ad hoc Networks (MANETs) are characterized by their limited resources. Hence, the concept of clustering was introduced to allow spacial reuse of bandwidth and to minimize routing overhead. However, node mobility perturbs the stability of the network and affects the performance of other protocols such as scheduling, routing, and resource allocation, which makes re-clustering the network to maintain up-to-date information at each node unavoidable. Consequently, clustering models for MANETS should be carefully designed while taking into consideration the fact that mobile nodes are energy constrained. In this paper, we propose a dynamic energy-efficient clustering algorithm that prolongs the network lifetime by electing cluster-heads taking into consideration, in addition to other parameters such as mobility, their residual energies and making them dynamically monitor their energy consumption to either diminish the number of their cluster-members or relinquish their roles. We have evaluated the performance of the proposed clustering model and compared it with other related clustering approaches found in the literature. Obtained results show the efficiency of the proposed algorithm. Copyright \u00a9 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.#R##N##R##N#The proposed dynamic energy efficient clustering algorithm (DEECA) prolongs the network lifetime by electing cluster-heads taking into consideration their residual energies and making them dynamically monitor their energy consumption to either diminish the number of their cluster members or relinquish their roles.

{"abstract": "A bewildering variety of devices for communication from humans to computers now exists on the market. In this article, we propose a descriptive framework for analyzing the design space of these input devices. We begin with Buxton's (1983) idea that input devices are transducers of physical properties in one, two, or three dimensions. Following Mackinlay's semantic analysis of the design space for graphical presentations, we extend this idea to more comprehensive descriptions of physical properties, space, and transducer mappings. In our reformulation, input devices are transducers of any combination of linear and rotary, absolute and relative, position and force, in any of the six spatial degrees of freedom. Simple input devices are described in terms of semantic mappings from the transducers of physical properties into the parameters of the applications. One of these mappings, the resolution function, allows us to describe the range of possibilities from continuous devices to discrete devices, including possibilities in between. Complex input controls are described in terms of hierarchical families of generic devices and in terms of composition operators on simpler devices. The description that emerges is used to produce a new taxonomy of input devices. The taxonomy is compared with previous taxonomies of Foley, Wallace, and Chan (1984) and of Buxton (1983) by reclassifying the devices previously analyzed by these authors. The descriptive techniques are further applied to the design of complex mouse-based virtual input controls for simulated three-dimensional (3D) egocentric motion. One result is the design of a new virtual egocentric motion control.", "authors": ["Jock D. Mackinlay", "Stuart K. Card", "George G.

{"abstract": "We introduce the notion of power management within the context of wireless ad-hoc networks. More specifically, we investigate the effects of using different transmit powers on the average power consumption and end-to-end network throughput in a wireless ad-hoc environment. This power management approach would help in reducing the system power consumption and hence prolonging the battery life of mobile nodes. Furthermore, it improves the end-to-end network throughput as compared to other ad-hoc networks in which all mobile nodes use the same transmit power. The improvement is due to the achievement of a tradeoff between minimizing interference ranges, reduction in the average number of hops to reach a destination, reducing the probability of having isolated clusters, and reducing the average number of transmissions (including retransmissions due to collisions). The protocols would first dynamically determine an optimal connectivity range wherein they adapt their transmit powers so as to only reach a subset of the nodes in the network. The connectivity range would then be dynamically changed in a distributed manner so as to achieve the near optimal throughput. Minimal power routing is used to further enhance performance. Simulation studies are carried out in order to investigate these design approaches. It is seen a network with such a power managed scheme would achieve a better end-to-end throughput performance (about 10% improvement with a slotted aloha MAC protocol) and lower transmit power (about an 80% Improvement) than a network without such a scheme.", "authors": ["Tamer A.

{"abstract": "This paper reports on two experiments comparing mental representations and program comprehension by novices in the object-oriented and procedural styles. The subjects were novice programmers enrolled in a second course in programming which taught either the object-oriented or the procedural paradigm. The first experiment compared the mental representations and comprehension of short programs written in the procedural and object-oriented styles. The second experiment extended the study to a larger program incorporating more advanced language features. For the short programs there was no significant difference between the two groups with respect to the total number of questions answered correctly, but the object-oriented subjects were superior to the procedural subjects at answering questions about program function. This suggests that function information was more readily available in their mental representations of the programs and supports an argument that the object-oriented notation highlights function at the level of the individual class. For the long program a corresponding effect was not found. The comprehension of procedural subjects was superior to object-oriented subjects on all types of question. The difficulties experienced by the object-oriented subjects in answering questions in a larger program suggest that they faced problems in marshaling information and drawing inferences from it. We suggest that this result may be related to a longer learning curve for novices of the object-oriented style, as well as to features of the OO style and the particular OO language notation.", "authors": ["Susan Wiedenbeck", "Vennila Ramalingam", "Suseela Sarasamma", "Cynthia L.

{"abstract": "We study the problem of detecting objects in still, gray-scale images. Our primary focus is the development of a learning-based approach to the problem that makes use of a sparse, part-based representation. A vocabulary of distinctive object parts is automatically constructed from a set of sample images of the object class of interest; images are then represented using parts from this vocabulary, together with spatial relations observed among the parts. Based on this representation, a learning algorithm is used to automatically learn to detect instances of the object class in new images. The approach can be applied to any object with distinguishable parts in a relatively fixed spatial configuration; it is evaluated here on difficult sets of real-world images containing side views of cars, and is seen to successfully detect objects in varying conditions amidst background clutter and mild occlusion.

{"abstract": "This correspondence considers the problem of how to adjust the phase angles of a periodic signal with a given power spectrum to minimize its peak-to-peak amplitude. This \"peak-factor problem\" arises in radar, sonar, and numerous other applications. However, in spite of the wide-spread interest it has evoked, the peak-factor problem has so far defied solution except in cases where the number of spectral components is small enough to permit an effectively exhaustive search of all phase angle combinations. In this correspondence, a formula for the phase angles is derived that yields generally low peak factors, often comparable to that of a sinusoidal signal of equal power. A formula is also derived for the case in which the phase angles are restricted to 0 and \\pi . The latter formula is applicable to the problem of constructing binary sequences of arbitrary length with Iow autocorrelation coefficients for nonzero shifts.", "authors": ["Manfred R.

{"abstract": "Integer-Overflow-to-Buffer-Overflow ( IO2BO ) vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to cause severe damages to computer systems. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of IntTracker, an efficient dynamic tracking technique for detecting IO2BO vulnerabilities in C/C++ programs. IntTracker utilizes a static taint analysis to select potential overflow sites that are integer operations along  critical  paths, from sources that are program points reading values from users, to sinks that are memory allocation sites. It then instruments overflow checks at the selected sites. Instead of producing warnings once integer overflows occur, IntTracker replaces the overflown value with a very  large  and  rarely  used integer value ( dirty  value), and treats such the value as an overflow tag. Tag propagation is performed by the existing program operations without any instrumentation as operations on dirty values often produce dirty values. Propagation can be automatically cut off by sanitization routines as they could prevent dirty values from affecting further program execution. IntTracker monitors whether any dirty value is used at a sink to detect IO2BO vulnerabilities. We evaluate IntTracker on 3444 programs of the NIST's SAMATE reference dataset, the SPEC CINT2000 benchmarks and 34 IO2BO bugs in real world. The experimental results show that IntTracker is effective in detecting harmful IO2BO vulnerabilities while bypassing false positives introduced by sanitization routines. Meanwhile, the runtime overhead is negligible, averaging about 0.69%. In contrast, IntPatch, the state of the art, produces a lot more false positives and has a higher overhead.", "authors": ["Hao Sun", "Xiangyu Zhang", "Chao Su", "Qingkai Zeng"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["00f4c1d6-7224-4c69-8bf7-08f1478594dc", "038dd5d0-22af-4eb4-874b-465264d00d47", "2db833d5-9295-423f-8a8f-3951e883cbff", "3529ba39-6d9f-4b8e-8cdb-2194cfc6df57", "35a1199e-de2c-43c6-b3ed-e3695cf21b20", "56bb3ada-74a1-4c86-b31b-dcf9b8f714b6", "5d3b460a-466a-4b15-96ec-de51765b5db8", "67e32f5b-00e3-47d5-9122-9ed7fa7fac09", "715393df-a408-4104-9297-8f0807e4a853", "75df6559-24d3-450e-b72d-3e0f09317998", "7c571ab3-82cc-459a-a775-6ef7b81848c9", "a291efd5-4f46-4037-ad4d-8b43e7475d5d", "a4340e11-fb8f-43f9-8553-3259e0967bf0", "c2e799a3-8a38-48d3-9a2e-cbbdf97cec3e", "cb4c9d52-4670-4de1-b43f-f8ecc202a2b6", "d7514de9-971d-4087-a6ae-e39a7e22109c", "e0fc9191-1f92-4598-82d3-892529c2d4aa", "f17f3b0c-ab70-4d4c-adb4-a2276cecb89d"], "title": "Efficient Dynamic Tracking Technique for Detecting Integer-Overflow-to-Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability", "venue": "computer and communications security", "year": 2015, "id": "a9f20c83-48c9-46bd-983a-52e84ce42c25"}

The system deduces the effects of actions using deductive rules. The implications of allowing parallel actions in a plan or problem solution are discussed. New techniques for efficiently detecting and remedying harmful parallel interactions are presented. The most important of these techniques, reasoning about resources, is emphasized and explained.

Our key insight is to exploit the relationship between the power network model and a first-order model of coupled oscillators. Assuming overdamped generators (possibly due to local excitation controllers), a singular perturbation analysis shows the equivalence between the classic swing equations and a nonuniform Kuramoto model. Here, nonuniform Kuramoto oscillators are characterized by multiple time constants, nonhomogeneous coupling, and nonuniform phase shifts.

{"abstract": "Active networking allows the network infrastructure to be programmable. Previous research focused on two commonly separated approaches: \"capsules\" and \"programmable switches\". Capsules are typically small programs in packets which flow through the network and are executed in-band on nodes receiving them. Programmable switches are network devices which offer a back-door to inject code by a network administrator out-of-band in order to enhance the device's capabilities. By combining these two approaches, this paper proposes a novel system architecture which allows both application specific data processing in network nodes as well as rapid deployment of new network protocol implementations. Instead of carrying code, data packets carry pointers to digitally signed active modules initially loaded on-the-fly, inband from trusted code servers on the network. Packet processing runs at high speed, may access and modify the whole network subsystem and no potentially slow virtual machines are needed.", "authors": ["Dan Decasper", "Bernhard Plattner"], "n_citation": 112, "references": ["3d01abf8-7b3b-47a9-827b-3492bb4c95c3", "514ffcdd-f022-47cf-b27e-dddb1a0bb99f", "5aece226-0c05-46c2-9b78-3447e0065e39", "7172ba56-f3d2-4c77-a734-51ee4a915ae8", "774c2290-54f4-4dcb-a129-6770a2ef8ef9", "7aec1cd5-3106-4ef7-8676-01b3b8fac8c2", "9771c887-0cd9-4416-a8ca-be5170e4246e", "ac3319ad-c1b8-4b95-a5d2-4c77f44fd224", "db8079b0-f841-44ba-a466-d069a1f08f10", "e686a21e-de1a-4c46-9008-f1aabef956ee"], "title": "DAN: distributed code caching for active networks", "venue": "international conference on computer communications", "year": 1998, "id": "9462a516-07ea-4007-9b4b-09ec477e6aff"}

{"abstract": "Publisher Summary   This chapter discusses MARMOT, a tool to check during runtime if message passing interface (MPI) application conforms to the MPI standard\u2014 that is, if resources like communicators, datatypes etc., and other parameters are handled correctly. Another problem with parallel programs is the occurrence of race conditions or deadlocks. Examples are the introduction of irreproducibility, deadlocks, and incorrect management of resources like communicators, groups, datatypes, and operators. The benchmark results show that the use of MARMOT introduces a certain overhead, especially when the execution is serialized. As the development of MARMOT is still ongoing, the main emphasis has so far been on implementing its functionality and not on optimizing its performance. However, the benchmarks results show that for applications with a reasonable communication to computation ratio, the overhead of using MARMOT is below 20%\u201350% on up to 16 processors. The idea of MARMOT is to verify the standard conformance of an MPI program automatically during runtime and help to debug the program in case of problems.", "authors": ["Bettina Krammer", "Katrin Bidmon", "Matthias S.

The approach essentially consists of checking that the quantified constraint is satisfied for all members of the universe. We present a general algorithm for proving that quantified constraints are satisfied when the domains of all of the variables are finite. We then describe a class of quantified constraints for which we can efficiently prove satisfiability even when the domains are infinite.

{"abstract": "In typical data grids large amounts of replicated data are stored all over the globe in different storage systems with access latencies ranging from seconds to hours. The task of a replica management system is not only to keep track of the replicas but also to select those replicas that can be accessed by an application program with a minimal response or transfer time. Most wide-area replication research focuses on network-based replica selection. However, our past experience with data grids has shown that often hierarchical storage systems are the main bottleneck rather than network links. This is due to the fact that access latencies of hierarchical storage systems can be of the order of seconds up to hours in case the data resides on a tape that is not mounted yet. We give an overview of our replica management framework called Reptor and a storage system cost estimator that is used. Furthermore, we give details on access estimation of file replicas that reside on hierarchical storage systems. The results show that the access estimates provide a good basis for a replica management system to perform efficient replica selection.", "authors": ["Kurt Stockinger", "Heinz Stockinger", "Lukasz Dutka", "Renata Slota", "Darin Nikolow", "Jacek Kitowski"], "n_citation": 28, "references": ["251ba847-efd4-4486-ba5e-e51ee4602763", "34e7d647-8edc-4eec-a5b4-2065da4e07e5", "6aad7b6e-3799-4bd0-b5e1-e0446670452f", "bf5692a0-2886-4658-9cc0-c6ad9e69f5ea", "c6d188af-cab0-4b38-8237-3c368062d08a", "eff9adf0-c70b-42cc-9d6d-47ec62958c23"], "title": "Access cost estimation for unified grid storage systems", "venue": "latin american web congress", "year": 2003, "id": "60a5389f-f647-42bc-ac62-b438ddaafc34"}
{"abstract": "Dynamic power management (DPM) refers to the problem of judicious application of various low-power techniques based on runtime conditions in an embedded system to minimize the total energy consumption. To be effective, often such decisions take into account the operating conditions and the system-level design goals. DPM has been a subject of intense research in the past decade driven by the need for low power consumption in modern embedded devices. We present a comprehensive overview of two closely related approaches to designing DPM strategies, namely, competitive analysis approach and model checking approach based on adversarial modeling. Although many other approaches exist for solving the system-level DPM problem, these two approaches are closely related and are based on a common theme. This commonality is in the fact that the underlying model is that of a competition between the system and an adversary. The environment that puts service demands on devices is viewed as an adversary, or to be in competition with the system to make it burn more energy, and the DPM strategy is employed by the system to counter that.", "authors": ["Sandy Irani", "Gaurav Singh", "Sandeep K.

The topographic significance of the Morse and drainage structures of digital elevation maps (DEMs) suggests that they can been used as the basis of an efficient encoding scheme. As an application, we combine this geometric representation with an interpolation algorithm and lossless data compression schemes to develop a compression scheme for DEMs. This algorithm achieves high compression while controlling the maximum error in the decoded elevation map, a property that is necessary for the majority of applications dealing with DEMs. We present the underlying theory and compression results for standard DEM data.", "authors": ["Andres Fco.

{"abstract": "We consider distributed consensus and vehicular formation control problems. Specifically we address the question of whether local feedback is sufficient to maintain coherence in large-scale networks subject to stochastic disturbances. We define macroscopic performance measures which are global quantities that capture the notion of coherence; a notion of global order that quantifies how closely the formation resembles a solid object. We consider how these measures scale asymptotically with network size in the topologies of regular lattices in 1, 2, and higher dimensions, with vehicular platoons corresponding to the 1-D case. A common phenomenon appears where a higher spatial dimension implies a more favorable scaling of coherence measures, with a dimensions of 3 being necessary to achieve coherence in consensus and vehicular formations under certain conditions. In particular, we show that it is impossible to have large coherent 1-D vehicular platoons with only local feedback. We analyze these effects in terms of the underlying energetic modes of motion, showing that they take the form of large temporal and spatial scales resulting in an accordion-like motion of formations. A conclusion can be drawn that in low spatial dimensions, local feedback is unable to regulate large-scale disturbances, but it can in higher spatial dimensions. This phenomenon is distinct from, and unrelated to string instability issues which are commonly encountered in control problems for automated highways.", "authors": ["Bassam Bamieh", "Mihailo R.

{"abstract": "Feedback is viewed as an essential element of ubiquitous computing systems in the HCI literature for helping people manage their privacy. However, the success of online social networks and existing commercial systems for mobile location sharing which do not incorporate feedback would seem to call the importance of feedback into question. We investigated this issue in the context of a mobile location sharing system. Specifically, we report on the findings of a field de-ployment of Locyoution, a mobile location sharing system. In our study of 56 users, one group was given feedback in the form of a history of location requests, and a second group was given no feedback at all. Our major contribution has been to show that feedback is an important contributing factor towards improving user comfort levels and allaying privacy concerns. Participants' privacy concerns were reduced after using the mobile location sharing system. Additionally,our study suggests that peer opinion and technical savviness contribute most to whether or not participants thought they would continue to use a mobile location technology.", "authors": ["Janice Y.

{"abstract": "The IETF Differentiated Services Working Group has recently standardized the assured forwarding (AF) per hop behavior (PHB). RFC 2597 recommends that an active queue management (AQM) technique be used to realize the multiple levels of drop precedence required in the AF PHB. The most widely used AQM scheme is RED (random early detection). There are several ways to extend RED to a multi-level RED (MRED) algorithm suitable for the AF PHB. This work compares two possible MRED implementations and their ability to protect lower drop precedence traffic: WRED (weighted RED) and RIO (RED with in/out). Based on an empirical study, this paper makes the following key contributions: firstly, the results show that for ON-OFF traffic, RIO is better than WRED in protecting packets marked for treatment with lower drop precedence. Secondly, for short-lived flows, RIO achieves higher transactional rates than WRED. Thirdly, for bulk transfer, RIO and WRED achieve comparable long-term throughput. Finally, this paper also reports the results of experiments with 3 different models for setting of WRED and RIO parameters. We recommend the \"staggered\" model as best suited to achieve the requirements of the AF PHB.", "authors": ["Rupinder Makkar", "Ioannis Lambadaris", "Jamal Hadi Salim", "Nabil Seddigh", "Biswajit Nandy", "Jozef Babiarz"], "n_citation": 99, "references": ["ccb819ee-9f31-4479-8a04-92cba2e67857", "d2b7db5d-bc47-48c7-a173-865fed9bff96", "d4e06d94-9c48-4b5d-8a51-a3753424a6bf", "eb457da7-a220-4f57-9a39-45cba9a7941e"], "title": "Empirical study of buffer management scheme for Diffserv assured forwarding PHB", "venue": "international conference on computer communications and networks", "year": 2000, "id": "0e3937b5-b60b-4b6a-a573-b974a2d54879"}

By controlling the position of the image drawing area for each user according to the corresponding user's viewpoint, each user can observe the stereoscopic image pairs shown in an individual area of the display system with shutter glasses. On the other hand, no user is able to see the image drawing areas of the other users because these areas are adequately occluded by the display mask.

{"abstract": "There is presently great interest in the abilities of neural networks to mimic \"qualitative reasoning\" by manipulating neural incodings of symbols. Less work has been performed on using neural networks to process floating point numbers and it is sometimes stated that neural networks are somehow inherently inaccurate and therefore best suited for \"fuzzy\" qualitative reasoning. Nevertheless, the potential speed of massively parallel operations make neural net \"number crunching\" an interesting topic to explore. In this paper we discuss some of our work in which we demonstrate that for certain applications neural networks can achieve significantly higher numerical accuracy than more conventional techniques. In particular, prediction of future values of a chaotic time series can be performed with exceptionally high accuracy. We analyze how a neural net is able to do this, and in the process show that a large class of functions from Rn \u2192 Rm may be accurately approximated by a backpropagation neural net with just two \"hidden\" layers. The network uses this functional approximation to perform either interpolation (signal processing applications) or extrapolation (symbol processing applications). Neural nets therefore use quite familiar methods to perform their tasks. The geometrical viewpoint advocated here seems to be a useful approach to analyzing neural network operation and relates neural networks to well studied topics in functional approximation.", "authors": ["Alan S.

{"abstract": "In this paper we assume that a multihop wireless network (also called a wireless ad hoc network) consists of nodes whose transmitting powers are finitely adjustable. We consider two fundamental problems related to power consumption in this kind of network. One is the minimum-energy broadcast tree problem, which broadcasts a message from a source node to all the other nodes in the network such that the summation of transmission powers at all nodes is minimized; and another is the minimum-energy multicast tree problem, which multicasts a message from a source node to the nodes in a given subset of nodes such that the summation of the transmission powers at all involved nodes is minimized.We first show the minimum-energy broadcast tree problem is NP-complete. We then present an approximate algorithm for the problem in a general setting, which delivers an approximate solution with a bounded performance guarantee. The algorithm takes  O (( k +1) 1/e n 3/e  time, where  n  is the number of nodes in the wireless network,  k  is the number of power levels at each node, and e is constant with  0 iex 1. For a special case of the problem where every node is equipped with the same type of battery, we propose an approximate algorithm which has a better performance ratio than that in the general case setting, and the algorithm takes  O (kn 2  log  n ) time. We finally extend the technique for the minimum-energy broadcast tree problem to solve the minimum-energy multicast tree problem, which leads to a similar result. The technique adopted in this paper is to reduce the minimum-energy broadcast (multicast) tree problem on a wireless ad hoc network to an optimization problem on an auxiliary weighted graph, and solve the optimization problem on the auxiliary graph which in turn gives an approximate solution for the original problem.", "authors": ["Weifa Liang"], "n_citation": 349, "references": ["09b9c603-f634-43ea-abd0-14062d7473f9", "38f54b84-5272-43df-8cde-a3e755b17dee", "4235c9ac-5ae8-4ca2-a7a5-3fd55fdadff7", "48140694-949f-48c9-8871-dff964c2dcc4", "5a17764b-1439-4e14-9eec-16bc056e9542", "91e9ffba-7445-46fd-8813-f9f96e2a0bbb", "9dfc2115-597c-48eb-aefb-f8578b6081ff", "c3ac4e19-59a6-45fc-bafd-15ac4c4b268c", "c565e4c3-9564-4d6d-ad00-7e7136f450b2", "c9164fc1-2641-49db-81c4-5a515d9ce8b0", "c91987c1-5b6f-4c38-8765-ea4fd851c1fa", "cd1f4a53-5ab5-408b-bb60-55b67e81d8d7", "eb2d1de3-f258-4c02-af57-23fbc2113dae", "f2880934-1b10-45df-860a-4810f6a84f71"], "title": "Constructing minimum-energy broadcast trees in wireless ad hoc networks", "venue": "mobile ad hoc networking and computing", "year": 2002, "id": "be525b4a-ef88-4a4b-b2fe-296dc42639de"}
{"abstract": "Component Based Development (CBD) promises a large step forward in the quest for maximizing reuse in software development. Although a variety of definitions of CBD exists, key to CBD is the process of building systems by way of combination and integration of pre-engineered and pre-tested software components. For CBD to be the long awaited breakthrough in software development, the efficient reuse of software components has to be organized by a market system;  \"Components develop their full potential only in a component market\"  [5]. Organizations may benefit from organizing an internal component market. Software components can then be reused over multiple projects saving valuable resources. However, the most appropriate marketplace to buy and sell components would be the Internet: an international, freely accessible network, which is perfectly suited for offering, promoting and distributing components. A flourishing component market on the Internet would really allow organizations to buy and reuse against low-costs. Developers would only need to focus on functionality specific to the project, and on locating and integrating available components.Industry watchers have predicted huge growth figures for the software component market. Gartner predicts the component market will grow to $7 billion in 2001, of which $2 billion directly comes from component sales [1]. Giga information group predicts an  off-the-shelf  component market of $3,3 billion in 2001 [6]. Ovum goes further by estimating the size of the software component market to be $64 billion in 2002 [3].But does a component market on the Internet already exist, and if so, what is its status? Also, if a component market is so important for CBD to fulfil its promises, what are the conditions for growth towards maturity? Apart from rough estimations of the future size of the market, little research has been done to investigate the current component market and its growth. It is the objective of the research reported on in this paper to gain insight into these questions.The research described in this article contained two phases: First, an overview of the current status of the component market on the Internet was created. Next, based on this overview and a literature study, conditions for growth of the market were developed. An email-survey was held in which experts were asked to rate these conditions by importance and comment on them. Section two and three describe the results of these research phases respectively.", "authors": ["Vincent Traas", "Jos van Hillegersberg"], "n_citation": 62, "references": ["eff9adf0-c70b-42cc-9d6d-47ec62958c23"], "title": "The software component market on the internet current status and conditions for growth", "venue": "ACM Sigsoft Software Engineering Notes", "year": 2000, "id": "2cec76d6-dbba-4dae-b416-ecb99a2ca121"}
{"abstract": "We describe a system that computes radiosity solutions for polygonal environments much larger than can be stored in main memory. The solution is stored in and retrieved from a database as the computation proceeds. Our system is based on two ideas: the use of visibility oracles to find source and blocker surfaces potentially visible to a receiving surface; and the use of hierarchical techniques to represent interactions between large surfaces efficiently, and to represent the computed radiosity solution compactly. Visibility information allows the environment to be  partitioned  into subsets, each containing all the information necessary to transfer light to a cluster of receiving polygons. Since the largest subset needed for any particular cluster is much smaller than the total size of the environment, these subset computations can be performed in much less memory than can classical or hierarchical radiosity. The computation is then  ordered  for further efficiency. Careful ordering of energy transfers minimizes the number of database reads and writes. We report results from large solutions of unfurnished and furnished buildings, and show that our implementation's observed running time scales nearly linearly with both local and global model complexity.", "authors": ["Seth J.

{"abstract": "We describe an algorithm and software for creating variable resolution displays in real time, contingent upon the direction of gaze. The algorithm takes as input a video sequence and an arbitrary, real-valued, two-dimensional map that specifies a desired amount of filtering (blur) at each pixel location relative to direction of gaze. For each input video image the follow operations are performed: (1) the image is coded as a multi-resolution pyramid, (2) the gaze direction is measured, (3) the resolution map is shifted to the gaze direction, (4) the desired filtering at each pixel location is achieved by interpolating between levels of the pyramid using the resolution map, and (5) the interpolated image is displayed. The transfer function associated with each level of the pyramid is calibrated beforehand so that the interpolation produces exactly the desired amount of filtering at each pixel. This algorithm produces precision, artifactfree displays in 8-bit grayscale or 24-bit color. The software can process live or prerecorded video at over 60 frames per second on ordinary personal computers without special hardware. Direction of gaze for each processed video frame may be taken from an eye-tracker, from a sequence of directions saved on disk, or from another pointing device (such as a mouse). The software is demonstrated by simulating the visual fields of normals and of patients with low vision.

{"abstract": "In the new AI of the 90s an important stream is artificial social intelligence. In this work basic ontological categories for social action, structure, and mind are introduced. Sociality (social action, social structure) is let emerge from the action and intelligence of individual agents in a common world. Also some aspects of the way-down-how emergent collective phenomena shape the individual mind-are examined. First, interference and dependence are defined, and then different kinds of coordination (reactive versus anticipatory; unilateral versus bilateral; selfish versus collaborative) are characterised. \u201cWeak social action\u201d, based on beliefs about the mind of the other agents, and \u201cstrong social action\u201d, based on goals about others\u2019 minds and their actions, are distinguished. Special attention is paid to Goal Delegation and Goal Adoption that are considered as the basic ingredients of social commitment and contract, and then of exchange, cooperation, group action, and organisation. Different levels of delegation and then of autonomy of the delegated agent are described; and different levels of goal-adoption are shown to characterise true collaboration. Social goals in the minds of the group members are argued to be the real glue of joint activity, and the notion of social commitment, as different from individual and from collective commitment, is underlined. The necessity for modelling social objective structures and constraints is emphasised and the \u201cshared mind\u201d view of groups and organisations is criticised. The spontaneous and unaware emergence of a dependence structure is explained, as well as its feedback on the participants\u2019 minds and behaviours. Critical observations are presented on current confusions such as that between \u201csocial\u201d and \u201ccollective\u201d action, or between communication and social action. The main claims of the paper are the following: (a) The real foundation of all sociality (cooperation, competition, groups, organisation, etc.) is the individual social action and mind. One cannot reduce or connect action at the collective level to action at the individual level unless one passes through the social character of the individual action. (b) Important levels of coordination and cooperation necessarily require minds and cognitive agents (beliefs, desires, intentions, etc.). (c) However, cognition, communication and agreement are not enough for modelling and implementing cooperation: emergent pre-cognitive structures and constraints should be formalised, and emergent forms of cooperation are needed also among planning and deliberative agents.

{"abstract": "The paper investigates the use of image histograms as watermarks. First, the problem of exact histogram specification is addressed and a method for exact histogram specification, consistent with the human perception of brightness, is developed. Next, two watermarking techniques based on exact histogram specification are proposed. The first one directly considers image histograms as watermarks. Thus, a particular histogram is assigned as a watermark and images are further transformed to have exactly the assigned histogram. Since quite large variations in image histogram are not perceived by humans, an unlimited number of invisible watermarks can be defined for which images appear visually non-distorted. Besides, by selecting histograms which are variations of uniform histogram, the transformed images are not only uniquely marked but also enhanced. The second approach conserves, for each image, its original histogram. The watermarking procedure consists of two histogram specification transforms: a transform to the assigned watermark followed by an inverse transform to recover the original histogram. Since image recovery after a histogram specification transform is not exact, the error obtained after the two consecutive transforms is further used to track each watermark.\u00a9 (1999) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

We extend our motion estimation algorithms to find motion vectors for sub-parts of a block, as allowed for in the H.263 and MPEG-4 standards, and propose an efficient two-tier decision strategy for the one-four motion-vector decision. We introduce a new measure of block similarity that can improve the inter-intra mode decision significantly. Furthermore, for certain motion-estimation strategies, this new measure can also improve the bit rate resulting from a better motion estimation. Another issue that we address is the estimation of delta motion vectors in the H.263 and MPEG-4 standards.

{"abstract": "The process of understanding a source code in a high-level programming language involves complex computation. Given a piece of legacy code and a library of program plan templates, understanding the code corresponds to building mappings from parts of the source code to particular program plans. These mappings could be used to assist an expert in reverse engineering legacy code, to facilitate software reuse, or to assist in the translation of the source into another programming language. In this paper we present a model of program understanding using constraint satisfaction. Within this model we intelligently compose a partial global picture of the source program code by transforming knowledge about the problem domain and the program itself into sets of constraints. We then systematically study different search algorithms and empirically evaluate their performance. One advantage of the constraint satisfaction model is its generality; many previous attempts in program understanding could now be cast under the same spectrum of heuristics, and thus be readily compared. Another advantage is the improvement in search efficiency using various heuristic techniques in constraint satisfaction.", "authors": ["Steven G.

{"abstract": "With the proliferation of internet-based technologies within and between organisations, large-scale enterprise systems are becoming more interconnected than ever before. A significant problem facing these organisations is how their information systems will cope with inconsistency being introduced from external data sources. Major problems arise when low quality information enters an authoritative enterprise system from these external sources, and in so doing gains credibility. This problem is compounded by the propagation of this information to other systems and other enterprises, potentially 'invading' an inter-enterprise network. In this paper we will introduce and examine this behaviour, which we term 'information invasion'.

Yet, there has been relatively little research on information requirements determination, and there are relatively few practical, well-formulated procedures for obtaining complete, correct information requirements.

Various strategies for obtaining information requirements are explained. Examples are given of methods that fit each strategy.

As metrics become increasingly complex, implementing them using imperative and interrogative programming is oftentimes cumbersome. Consequently, their understanding, testing and reuse are severely hampered. In this paper we identify a set of key mechanisms that are involved in the implementation of design metrics and, more general, of design-related structural analyses: navigation, selection, set arithmetic, filtering and property aggregation. We show that neither of the aforementioned approaches offers a simple support for all these mechanisms and, as a result, an undesirable overhead of complexity is added to the implementation of metrics.

{"abstract": "Predictive constrained control of time-varying and/or uncertain linear systems has been effected through the use of ellipsoidal invariant sets (Kothare et al., 1996). Linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) have been used to design a state-dependent state-feedback law that maintains the state vector inside invariant feasible sets. For the purposes of prediction however, at each time instant, the state feedback law is assumed constant. In addition, due to the large number of LMIs involved, online computation becomes intractable for anything other than small dimensional systems. Here we propose an approach that deploys a fixed state-feedback law but introduces extra degrees of freedom through the use of perturbations on the fixed state-feedback law. The problem is so formulated that all demanding computations can be performed offline leaving only a simple optimization problem to be solved online. Over and above the very significant reduction in computational cost, the extra degrees of freedom allow for better performance and wider applicability.", "authors": ["B. Kouvaritakis", "J.A.

{"abstract": "Over the past several years, US-CERT advisories, as well as most critical updates from software vendors, have been due to memory corruption vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows, heap overflows, etc. Several techniques have been developed to defend against the exploitation of these vulnerabilities, with the most promising defenses being based on randomization. Two randomization techniques have been explored so far: address space randomization (ASR) that randomizes the location of objects in virtual memory, and instruction set randomization (ISR) that randomizes the representation of code. We explore a third form of randomization called data space randomization (DSR) that randomizes the representation of data stored in program memory. Unlike ISR, DSR is effective against non-control data attacks as well as code injection attacks. Unlike ASR, it can protect against corruption of non-pointer data as well as pointer-valued data. Moreover, DSR provides a much higher range of randomization (typically 232for 32-bit data) as compared to ASR. Other interesting aspects of DSR include (a) it does not share a weakness common to randomization-based defenses, namely, susceptibility to information leakage attacks, and (b) it is capable of detecting some exploits that are missed by full bounds-checking techniques, e.g., some of the overflows from one field of a structure to the next field. Our implementation results show that with appropriate design choices, DSR can achieve a performance overhead in the range of 5% to 30% for a range of programs.", "authors": ["Sandeep Bhatkar", "R.

{"abstract": "Many large decentralized systems rely on information propagation to ensure their proper function. We examine a common scenario in which only participants that are aware of the information can compete for some reward, and thus informed participants have an incentive  not  to propagate information to others. One recent example in which such tension arises is the 2009 DARPA Network Challenge (finding red balloons). We focus on another prominent example: Bitcoin, a decentralized electronic currency system.   Bitcoin represents a radical new approach to monetary systems. It has been getting a large amount of public attention over the last year, both in policy discussions and in the popular press. Its cryptographic fundamentals have largely held up even as its usage has become increasingly widespread. We find, however, that it exhibits a fundamental problem of a different nature, based on how its incentives are structured. We propose a modification to the protocol that can eliminate this problem.   Bitcoin relies on a peer-to-peer network to track transactions that are performed with the currency. For this purpose, every transaction a node learns about should be transmitted to its neighbors in the network. As the protocol is currently defined and implemented, it does not provide an incentive for nodes to broadcast transactions they are aware of. In fact, it provides an incentive not to do so. Our solution is to augment the protocol with a scheme that rewards information propagation. Since clones are easy to create in the Bitcoin system, an important feature of our scheme is Sybil-proofness.   We show that our proposed scheme succeeds in setting the correct incentives, that it is Sybil-proof, and that it requires only a small payment overhead, all this is achieved with iterated elimination of dominated strategies. We complement this result by showing that there are no reward schemes in which information propagation and no self-cloning is a dominant strategy.", "authors": ["Moshe Babaioff", "Shahar Dobzinski", "Sigal Oren", "Aviv Zohar"], "n_citation": 135, "references": ["354e5b5e-54ea-4c48-81a4-2410e1484f0c", "5a469b0e-f9c8-4032-ad95-ed9d5b1e8c62", "80582445-a88a-467a-9191-0ccd9081b7b9", "a3d68052-f971-4ab4-8778-5738a42d5462", "a863ec87-1ff4-46bc-81f6-46d6aa255917", "c481a238-e0e3-4834-8b95-28a9ae50f344"], "title": "On bitcoin and red balloons", "venue": "electronic commerce", "year": 2012, "id": "c78ee55b-56cf-4004-b008-fc3398676365"}

Continuing that work, the present research had two objectives. First, it investigated the relationship between judgments differing in cognitive demands. Second, it began to identify specific visual attributes that appear to contribute to different judgments. Three experiments are reported. All used the stimuli and viewing time as before. Using a paradigm known to disrupt processing beyond the stimulus offset, Experiment 1 was designed to ensure that the previous findings could not be attributed to such continued processing. Adopting a within-subject design, Experiment 2 investigated the extent to which judgments differing in cognitive demands (visual appeal, perceived usability, trustworthiness) may be driven by the visual characteristics of a Web page. It also enabled analyses of visual attributes that contributed most to the different judgments. Experiment 3 replicated Experiment 2 but using a between-subject design to ensure that no practice effect could occur. The results suggest that all three types of judgments are largely driven by visual appeal, but that cognitively demanding judgments are processed in a qualitatively different manner than visual appeal, and that they rely on somewhat different visual attributes.

{"abstract": "The Web is becoming the main information dissemination means in private and public organizations. As a consequence, several applications at both internet and intranet level need mechanisms to support a selective access to data available over the Web. In this context, developing an access control model, and related mechanisms, in terms of XML (eXtensible Markup Language) is an important step, because XML is increasingly used as the language for representing information exchanged over the Web. In this paper, we propose access control policies and an associated model for XML documents, addressing peculiar protection requirements posed by XML. A first requirement is that varying protection granularity levels should be supported to guarantee a differentiated protection of document contents. A second requirement arises from the fact that XML documents do not always conform to a predefined document type. To cope with these requirements, the proposed model supports varying protection granularity levels, ranging from a set of documents, to a single document or specific document portion(s). Moreover, it allows the Security Administrator to choose different policies for documents not covered or only partially covered by the existing access control policies for document types.

{"abstract": "A novel hybrid dimension reduction method is proposed.It obtains a highly informed and much reduced feature subset.It improves obtained results of the underlying clustering method.It improves computational complexity of the underlying clustering method. High dimensionality of the feature space is one of the major concerns owing to computational complexity and accuracy consideration in the text clustering. Therefore, various dimension reduction methods have been introduced in the literature to select an informative subset (or sublist) of features. As each dimension reduction method uses a different strategy (aspect) to select a subset of features, it results in different feature sublists for the same dataset. Hence, a hybrid approach, which encompasses different aspects of feature relevance altogether for feature subset selection, receives considerable attention. Traditionally, union or intersection is used to merge feature sublists selected with different methods. The union approach selects all features and the intersection approach selects only common features from considered features sublists, which leads to increase the total number of features and loses some important features, respectively. Therefore, to take the advantage of one method and lessen the drawbacks of other, a novel integration approach namely modified union is proposed. This approach applies union on selected top ranked features and applies intersection on remaining features sublists. Hence, it ensures selection of top ranked as well as common features without increasing dimensions in the feature space much. In this study, feature selection methods term variance (TV) and document frequency (DF) are used for features' relevance score computation. Next, a feature extraction method principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to further reduce dimensions in the feature space without losing much information.

{"abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of face recognition under varying poses. To recognize a face under different poses, one approach is to use a human face 3D model. This approach is flexible but the equipment for acquiring the 3D face image is very expensive. The second approach is view-based. However, the complexity of the system is very high, as it requires constructing a representation for each view. For a 3D rotation, construction of dozens of representations may be required. This paper proposes a new idea to transform the face with unknown pose into frontal view for recognition. To construct the virtual frontal view image, we have developed an algorithm for detecting facial landmarks, which are then used to estimate the orientation of the face. A generic 3D spring-based face model is developed to transform the unknown face image into virtual frontal-view image. Finally, a spectroface method, which is based on wavelet transform and Fourier transform, is developed to recognize the virtual frontal face image. The proposed method has been tested by 1145 face images from 85 persons with different poses, facial expressions and small occlusions. The recognition accuracy for the best match is 84.7%. If we consider the top three matches, the accuracy increases to 92.9%.", "authors": ["Guocan Feng", "Pong Chi Yuen"], "n_citation": 69, "references": ["242488eb-889a-4885-b9ee-f9310db224df", "28dcf741-62ca-4a7a-ac46-cf4a8564989d", "33d74862-6527-4c30-be0c-95226a3f8a3a", "3b3d7569-08b1-4017-9910-2a017a00e43e", "3ca4470b-361a-4623-9e3d-6efc672ff736", "40f728c0-55b3-423b-aff5-a9b3ff27b7d5", "536c75e5-9cb5-4aef-a18e-edbe2dbd4d05", "54a5822c-e405-44ad-84e3-cea51e7349c2", "55734d9d-2b1c-4ec2-aed7-04d722913945", "565e362c-1111-4f46-a0a3-adff93bc6ee7", "56f4b72a-ec39-47ac-8220-899296e7fb18", "5832b78f-e55e-41c3-9c19-5e944df6c36f", "62bd054c-e639-43cd-b0ef-86e034d7c694", "6a8c159e-174b-4ba2-8ea0-694957f80202", "6b65d1f7-b9c6-4a07-8b91-23f994897535", "700061b6-54a5-4f50-a1ef-1d8de3015c43", "8c7c7e17-3875-4743-a7fd-8f1ef628a859", "a438b418-64d9-4719-9217-d4fa0c8be98f", "b089305a-249c-41ec-ab28-e9f2554293d2", "d5e5a24d-f80e-4f1a-b48b-22403b653276", "eb63b82d-5108-4abf-8ee7-2d11bc1998a0", "f6f9c3fa-6575-4408-ac39-3c7431c5a818"], "title": "Recognition of head-and-shoulder face image using virtual frontal-view image", "venue": "systems man and cybernetics", "year": 2000, "id": "89a9d16d-df4e-4e71-a924-67dde49ac316"}

{"abstract": "Bayesian logic programs tightly integrate definite logic programs with Bayesian networks in order to incorporate the notions of objects and relations into Bayesian networks. They establish a one-to-one mapping between ground atoms and random variables, and between the immediate consequence operator and the directly influenced by relation. In doing so, they nicely separate the qualitative (i.e. logical) component from the quantitative (i.e. the probabilistic) one providing a natural framework to describe general, probabilistic dependencies among sets of random variables. In this chapter, we present results on combining Inductive Logic Programming with Bayesian networks to learn both the qualitative and the quantitative components of Bayesian logic programs from data. More precisely, we show how the qualitative components can be learned by combining the inductive logic programming setting learning from interpretations with score-based techniques for learning Bayesian networks.

{"abstract": "Internet broadcasting - the simultaneous distribution of live content streams to a large audience - has a number of interesting applications ranging from real-time broadcasts of audio/video streams for online concerts or sporting events to efficient and reliable large-scale software distribution. We identify three fundamental requirements for scalable broadcasting services: an efficient infrastructure for large-scale broadcasting, an ability to adapt the infrastructure to suit the requirements of a wide range of applications, and ease of deployment of the infrastructure. Although solutions such as the network-layer IP multicast approach and a slew of overlay distribution networks exist today, none of these technologies satisfactorily addresses all of the above concerns.In this paper, we argue that an application-customizable hybrid overlay is well suited to meet these challenges. To this end, we propose an architecture called scattercast that relies on a network of strategically located agents called Scatter-Cast proXies or SCXs. These agents collaboratively provide the broadcast service for a session. Clients locate a nearby SCX and tap into the session via that SCX. Scattercast constructs a hybrid overlay network composed of unicast links between SCXs that interconnect locally scoped multicast regions. Rather than define a single standardized service model for transmitting data on top of the overlay, scattercast builds a customizable transport framework that provides adaptability by leveraging application-defined semantics to drive the distribution of content. We demonstrate the ability of our architecture to provide efficient distribution via a set of simulation experiments. Finally, we present our experience with the adaptability of the framework by describing two applications, a real-time Internet radio and an online slide-presentation tool, both of which we have built on top of a prototype implementation of the architecture.", "authors": ["Yatin Chawathe"], "n_citation": 153, "references": ["0695070f-320e-4d26-9c68-2c8faa20c944", "0ab8c0f9-fdba-428d-81a3-da79d759598e", "0acf822c-0856-492a-9d12-ccd40383c6b4", "14dbcb0a-b6a3-4407-9a3c-0ce575e268c9", "3293e60d-896b-4572-948b-2f481a93bba6", "40196395-a874-447d-ac4f-b358f40ecbb7", "5de99dee-6647-4ebf-b20b-fe970cfd062b", "723271cf-1cbe-49ed-aefb-c282294a1cdc", "8587b468-5d68-4fdd-b2a2-ab555641f0b9", "8e3a0a39-0bb3-45f5-9891-bbd991fa79f9", "9d11aa6c-586e-40dc-a475-094bf043431f", "afe13b82-4826-4529-b26c-5ccd6a564f50", "c10d9098-1bab-4b6f-b241-09304b954f1b", "c73f3498-af73-4ffb-bac1-11a93a91e1f5", "c8771a57-de9c-44b7-966c-1ff156d3091f", "d0ee2eea-5df8-4559-8c9d-46cc652d7cc0", "e1c7443f-fbc7-4edc-919b-8f3bd2c1a34c", "f6fc4443-7a98-4f9f-92e8-e4e5d94521a7"], "title": "Scattercast: an adaptable broadcast distribution framework", "venue": "Multimedia Systems", "year": 2003, "id": "444fd191-d031-455b-93dc-5338f00f8125"}
{"abstract": "The tokamak is a device that utilizes magnetic fields to confine a reactant gas to generate energy from nuclear fusion reactions. The next step towards the realization of a tokamak power plant is the ITER project, and extensive research has been conducted to find high performance operating scenarios characterized by a high fusion gain and plasma stability. A key property related to both the stability and performance of the plasma is the safety factor profile (q-profile). In this work, a general control-oriented physics-based modeling approach is developed, with emphasis on high performance scenarios, to convert the first-principles physics model that describes the q-profile evolution in the tokamak into a form suitable for control design, with the goal of developing closed-loop controllers to drive the q-profile to a desired target evolution. The DINA-CH& CRONOS and PTRANSP advanced tokamak simulation codes are used to tailor the first-principles-driven (FPD) model to the ITER and DIII-D tokamak geometries, respectively.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a new type of nonlinear function for independent component analysis to process complex-valued signals, which is used in frequency-domain blind source separation. The new function is based on the polar coordinates of a complex number, whereas the conventional one is based on the Cartesian coordinates. The new function is derived from the probability density function of frequency-domain signals that are assumed to be independent of the phase. We show that the difference between the two types of functions is in the assumed densities of independent components. Experimental results for separating speech signals show that the new nonlinear function behaves better than the conventional one.", "authors": ["Hiroshi Sawada", "Ryo Mukai", "Shoko Araki", "Shoji Makino"], "n_citation": 105, "references": ["0ddbfee1-8cc2-49f6-be79-59276f496884", "0e2afba3-c7e5-4af4-9ea3-d2ec3742cbd9", "27fbfb6b-2c20-45b8-a106-981d81e14154", "2a9ccb6e-78db-4605-b2dd-bf531abd5d81", "4b0bd6cb-95db-44d8-82d7-30d8fda3a733", "6f339396-22e8-41d0-a2f7-ff4f78665b45", "7ccac9f1-f310-45b1-9c15-7ff32f1052c7", "821096c2-9da2-4610-9a65-b13fc0e3878d", "a4a67bf6-4397-423b-8ae5-1ee5e3dd98f3", "b7f049dd-a32c-455e-bc72-6931410becd2", "f7741c14-c85b-41e9-b179-130c606d5317"], "title": "Polar coordinate based nonlinear function for frequency-domain blind source separation", "venue": "international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing", "year": 2002, "id": "576ceab7-3cfa-4964-9875-295a9276a496"}

{"abstract": "Probabilistic techniques for verification of finite-state transition systems offer huge memory savings over deterministic techniques. The two leading probabilistic schemes are hash compaction and the bitstate method, which stores states in a Bloom filter. Bloom filters have been criticized for being slow, inaccurate, and memory-inefficient, but in this paper, we show how to obtain Bloom filters that are simultaneously fast, accurate, memory-efficient, scalable, and flexible. The idea is that we can introduce large dependences among the hash functions of a Bloom filter with almost no observable effect on accuracy, and because computation of independent hash functions was the dominant computational cost of accurate Bloom filters and model checkers based on them, our savings are tremendous. We present a mathematical analysis of Bloom filters in verification in unprecedented detail, which enables us to give a fresh comparison between hash compaction and Bloom filters.

{"abstract": "Luby Transform code (LT code) is the first practical digital fountain code and has been widely used as basic components in many communication applications. The coding behavior of LT code is mainly decided by a probability distribution of codeword degrees. In order to customize a degree distribution for different purposes, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm is introduced to optimize degree distributions in this paper. Two critical performance indicators of LT code are considered in our experiments. Some applications hope to minimize the overhead of extra packets and some require to limit the computational cost of the coding system. To handle this problem, MOEA/D is applied to optimize two objectives simultaneously. We expect to obtain the Pareto front (PF) formed by partial optimal solutions and provide those available degree distributions to different LT code applications. Not only promising results are represented in this paper but also the behavior of LT code is thoroughly explored by optimizing the degree distribution according to multi-objectives.", "authors": ["Chih-Ming Chen", "Ying-ping Chen", "Tzu-Ching Shen", "John K.

{"abstract": "In a shared-memory multiprocessor system, it may be more efficient to schedule a task on one processor than on another if relevant data already reside in a particular processor's cache. The effects of this type of processor affinity are examined. It is observed that tasks continuously alternate between executing at a processor and releasing this processor due to I/O, synchronization, quantum expiration, or preemption. Queuing network models of different abstract scheduling policies are formulated, spanning the range from ignoring affinity to fixing tasks on processors. These models are solved via mean value analysis, where possible, and by simulation otherwise. An analytic cache model is developed and used in these scheduling models to include the effects of an initial burst of cache misses experienced by tasks when they return to a processor for execution. A mean-value technique is also developed and used in the scheduling models to include the effects of increased bus traffic due to these bursts of cache misses.

{"abstract": "This paper deals with architectural designs that specify components of a system and the permitted flows of information between them. In the process of systems development, one might refine such a design by viewing a component as being composed of subcomponents, and specifying permitted flows of information between these subcomponents and others in the design. The paper studies the soundness of such refinements with respect to a spectrum of different semantics for information flow policies. These include Goguen and Meseguer's purge-based definition, Haigh and Young's intransitive purge-based definition, and some more recent notions TA-security, TO-security and ITO-security defined by van der Meyden.

{"abstract": "An important security challenge is to protect the execution of security-sensitive code on legacy systems from malware that may infect the OS, applications, or system devices. Prior work experienced a tradeoff between the level of security achieved and efficiency. In this work, we leverage the features of modern processors from AMD and Intel to overcome the tradeoff to simultaneously achieve a high level of security and high performance. We present TrustVisor, a special-purpose hypervisor that provides code integrity as well as data integrity and secrecy for selected portions of an application. TrustVisor achieves a high level of security, first because it can protect sensitive code at a very fine granularity, and second because it has a very small code base (only around 6K lines of code) that makes verification feasible. TrustVisor can also attest the existence of isolated execution to an external entity. We have implemented TrustVisor to protect security-sensitive code blocks while imposing less than 7% overhead on the legacy OS and its applications in the common case.", "authors": ["Jonathan M.

{"abstract": "Recent theoretical results have shown that the generalization performance of thresholded convex combinations of base classifiers is greatly improved if the underlying convex combination has large margins on the training data (i.e., correct examples are classified well away from the decision boundary). Neural network algorithms and AdaBoost have been shown to implicitly maximize margins, thus providing some theoretical justification for their remarkably good generalization performance. In this paper we are concerned with maximizing the margin explicitly. In particular, we prove a theorem bounding the generalization performance of convex combinations in terms of general cost functions of the margin, in contrast to previous results, which were stated in terms of the particular cost function sgn(t \u2212 margin). We then present a new algorithm, DOOM, for directly optimizing a piecewise-linear family of cost functions satisfying the conditions of the theorem. Experiments on several of the datasets in the UC Irvine database are presented in which AdaBoost was used to generate a set of base classifiers and then DOOM was used to find the optimal convex combination of those classifiers. In all but one case the convex combination generated by DOOM had lower test error than AdaBoost's combination. In many cases DOOM achieves these lower test errors by sacrificing training error, in the interests of reducing the new cost function. In our experiments the margin plots suggest that the size of the minimum margin is not the critical factor in determining generalization performance.", "authors": ["Llew Mason", "Peter L.

{"abstract": "A key research focus for conversational case-based reasoning (CCBR) is incremental query elaboration, which is the process of maximizing the extraction of relevant problem state information throughout the querying process. Several companies and researchers have addressed this problem (e.g., by dynamically applying domain-specific plans (Carrick et al., 1999)). Recently, Gupta (2001) demonstrated how CCBR can be significantly enhanced through the judicious use of (1) taxonomies to represent domain information and (2) a control algorithm for focusing case retrieval. However, in that original conception, the individual taxonomies were isolated from each other, and from other information sources that could support query elaboration. This prevents information from being propagated to these taxonomies, and could inflate the length of the user\u2019s problem-solving session. In this paper, we outline and exemplify a causal query elaboration method for inter-taxonomy communication and highlight its potential benefits, which include shorter (and potentially more accurate) conversations, support for causal inferencing, and more concise case representations.", "authors": ["David W.

Our construction uses fast single precision arithmetic which is increasingly supported by modern processors due to the growing needs for fast arithmetic posed by multimedia applications. We report on hand-optimized assembly implementations on a 150 MHz PowerPC 604 and a 150 MHz Pentium-Pro, which achieve hashing speeds of 350 to 820 Mbit/sec, depending on the desired level of security (or collision probability), and a rate of more than 1 Gbit/sec on a 200 MHz Pentium-Pro. This represents a significant speed-up over current software implementations of universal hashing and other message authentication techniques (e.g., MD5-based). Moreover, our construction is specifically designed to take advantage of emerging microprocessor technologies (such as Intel's MMX, 64-bit architectures and others) and then best suited to accommodate the growing performance needs of cryptographic (and other universal hashing) applications. The construction is based on techniques due to Carter and Wegman for universal hashing using modular multilinear functions that we carefully modify to allow for fast software implementation.

{"abstract": "The time complexity of sorting n elements using p \u2265 n processors on Valiant's parallel comparison tree model is considered. The following results are obtained. 1. We show that this time complexity is \u0398(logn/log(1+p/n)). This complements the AKS sorting network in settling the wider problem of comparison sort of n elements by p processors, where the problem for p \u2264 n was resolved. To prove the lower bound, we show that to achieve time k \u2264 logn, we need \u03a9(kn1+1/k) comparisons. Haggkvist and Hell proved a similar result only for fixed k. 2. For every fixed time k, we show that: (a) \u03a9(n1+1/k lognl/k) comparisons are required, (O(n1+1/k logn) are known to be sufficient in this case), and (b) there exists a randomized algorithm for comparison sort in time k with an expected number of O(n1+1/k) comparisons. This implies that for every fixed k, any deterministic comparison sort algorithm must be asymptotically worse than this randomized algorithm. The lower bound improves on Haggkvist-Hell's lower bound. 3. We show that \"approximate sorting\" in time 1 requires asymptotically more than nlogn processors. This settles a problem raised by M.

{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#The purpose of this study was to identify fault-prone functions that are likely to contain faults in a given software system. Five metrics were used: Di, an internal design metric which incorporates factors related to a function's internal structure; De, an external design metric which focuses on a function's external relationships to the rest of the software system; D(G), a composite design metric which is a linear combination of Di and De; and the union and intersection of Di, De, and D(G). Since the system being considered was already developed, a very important aspect of our study was to extract the design information directly from the source code rather than from the corresponding design documentation which may not exist or, if it does exist, it may be incomplete, difficult to understand, or not updated. To make the analysis more accurate and efficient, a metric analysis tool (\u03c7Metrics) was implemented. We conducted experiments using \u03c7Metrics on part of a distributed software system, written in C, with a client\u2013server architecture, and identified a small percentage of its functions as good candidates for fault-proneness. Files containing these functions were then validated by the real defect data collected between a recent major release and its subsequent release for their fault-proneness. The results indicate that our metrics are good indicators of fault-prone functions. Two extra experiments were also conducted to show that function size cannot replace any of our metrics; and where the function size was factored out our metrics performed better than the normalized metrics.

{"abstract": "Principal curves have been defined as \"self-consistent\" smooth curves which pass through the \"middle\" of a d-dimensional probability distribution or data cloud. They give a summary of the data and also serve as an efficient feature extraction tool. We take a new approach by defining principal curves as continuous curves of a given length which minimize the expected squared distance between the curve and points of the space randomly chosen according to a given distribution. The new definition makes it possible to theoretically analyze principal curve learning from training data and it also leads to a new practical construction. Our theoretical learning scheme chooses a curve from a class of polygonal lines with k segments and with a given total length to minimize the average squared distance over n training points drawn independently. Convergence properties of this learning scheme are analyzed and a practical version of this theoretical algorithm is implemented. In each iteration of the algorithm, a new vertex is added to the polygonal line and the positions of the vertices are updated so that they minimize a penalized squared distance criterion. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm compares favorably with previous methods, both in terms of performance and computational complexity, and is more robust to varying data models.", "authors": ["Bal\u00e1zs K\u00e9gl", "Adam Krzyzak", "Tam\u00e1s Linder", "Kenneth Zeger"], "n_citation": 363, "references": ["64c8414b-e0ea-4154-8728-df1f66a7b143", "ab67feed-bca4-4826-bae3-aafe58ea4636"], "title": "Learning and design of principal curves", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": 2000, "id": "cd940e99-b4c0-4d97-bec8-9be405ac68ce"}

{"abstract": "Fisheye views allow people to see both a focus region and the surrounding context in the same window. However, the magnification effects of the fisheye lens can cause several problems for users. One of these is focus-targeting, where a user moves the focus to a new location. Magnification makes focus-targeting difficult because objects appear to move as the focus point approaches them. This paper examines how the distortion of a fisheye view affects focus-targeting performance, and present a technique called speed-coupled flattening (SCF) as a way to improve focus targeting in distortion-oriented views. SCF dynamically reduces the distortion level of a fisheye based on pointer velocity and acceleration. In an experiment, the technique resulted in significant reductions in both targeting time and targeting errors. By adjusting distortion based on the user's activity, we can improve usability without requiring the user to manipulate any additional view controls", "authors": ["Carl Gutwin"], "n_citation": 187, "references": ["3aeb282a-cd95-4cee-acfd-fe02172e3646", "4cb8c593-5a28-4af3-814f-406e0de95d58", "61db0bca-d9e7-416e-85c4-356175b666da", "7a1e7cd5-eb9d-4726-a5df-cebe0fcb6161", "88c79503-7faa-4063-9e97-8cf6c973e8ee", "adeac47f-3f0d-485b-aaf4-3b02a7493446", "dd8c5553-e8c0-463b-a8d1-75c241cfe953", "e9555a41-e89f-4ea4-b494-506a2697f72e", "eda98375-1903-4a23-b21a-1a497aa2ae4d", "edbc5c6b-2e88-44af-8cb9-83128e894109", "fb078e20-28a2-48ff-a4ed-adbf1825b5f5"], "title": "Improving focus targeting in interactive fisheye views", "venue": "human factors in computing systems", "year": 2002, "id": "e8e9bc35-be04-4a2f-9b9a-901a3fa8ea96"}

Two Quake 3 servers were placed at different locations on the Internet in 2001, and instrumented to gather median latency information on every player who played over a multi-month period. Server logfiles showed an active yet distinct player population on each server. The median latency distributions suggest players actively prefer Quake 3 servers less than 150 to 180 milliseconds from the player's location. Quake 3 is often played as a multiplayer, Internet-based, highly interactive \"first person shooter\" game.

{"abstract": "We argue that the software user, the developer, the designer and indeed the application logic itself all possess invaluable intelligence to gear how software should adapt itself to changing requirements and changing context. We present Chisel, an open framework for dynamic adaptation of services using reflection in a policy-driven, context-aware manner. The system is based on decomposing the particular aspects of a service object that do not provide its core functionality into multiple possible behaviours. As the execution environment, user context and application context change, the service object will be adapted to use different behaviours, driven by a human-readable declarative adaptation policy script. To demonstrate this framework we will provide a dynamically adaptive middleware for mobile computing. The framework will allow users and applications to make mobile-aware dynamic changes to the behaviour of various services of the middleware, and allow the addition of new unanticipated behaviours at run-time, without changing or stopping the middleware or an application that may be using it. This is achieved by implementing the behaviours as metatypes in Iguana/J, which supports non-invasive dynamic associations of metatypes to service objects without any requirement to interrupt, change or access the object's source code.", "authors": ["John Keeney", "Vinny Cahill"], "n_citation": 198, "references": ["1b1f8d83-c9e9-43fa-b442-ceb9050b762e", "55b34bff-bb31-45eb-81be-b55ea1298e79", "64e94682-f9ee-4bbd-9348-d3e62a0d8234", "6a63d9ee-dea5-4536-9beb-6a1580249326", "717a4dfd-7479-4ac8-9f66-8c6e59b8746e", "90d7d5e6-9d8a-4a14-b3c2-be903b964215", "a40dc4e4-f99f-4eaf-928f-d9f8fd9c8a13", "b8cc3183-54fc-4137-9c0d-69253979b075", "cb13359d-f20b-4ef6-8075-f12bf900a788", "d38f2f4c-3436-4f14-a76b-f96aa46f5d51", "db47b49a-352b-4dbe-8a94-ff334b3a9b9d", "eb0c2082-e47d-45a0-bc97-b6336ff6c565", "f685ad50-7418-48cc-bc50-a1123eb778f1"], "title": "Chisel: a policy-driven, context-aware, dynamic adaptation framework", "venue": "", "year": 2003, "id": "8ddea342-d423-49b1-a403-afe87185e744"}
{"abstract": "Many organisations are migrating towards object-oriented technology. However, owing to the business value of legacy software, new object-oriented development has to be weighed against salvaging strategies. The incremental migration of procedurally oriented systems to object-oriented platforms seems to be a feasible approach, although it must be considered as risky as redevelopment. This approach uses reverse engineering activities to abstract an object-oriented model from legacy code. The paper presents a method for decomposing legacy systems into objects. The identification of objects is centred around persistent data stores, such as files or tables in the database, while programs and routines are candidates for implementing the object methods. Associating the methods to the objects is achieved by optimising selected object-oriented design metrics. The rationale behind this choice is that the object-oriented decomposition of a legacy system should not result in a poor design, as this would make the re-engineered system more diAcult to maintain. \u201d 1999 Elsevier Science Inc.

{"abstract": "The wide range of performance characteristics of storage technologies motivates the use of a hybrid energy storage system (HESS)\u00a0that combines the best features of multiple technologies. However, HESS design is complex, in that it involves the choice of storage technologies, the sizing of each storage element, and deciding when to charge and discharge each underlying storage element ( operating strategy ). We formulate the problem of jointly optimizing the sizing and the operating strategy of an HESS that can be used for a large class of applications and storage technologies. Instead of a single set of storage element sizes, our approach determines the  Pareto-optimal frontier  of the sizes of the storage elements along with the corresponding optimal operating strategy. Thus, as long as the performance objective of a storage application (such as an off-grid microgrid) can be expressed as a linear combination of the underlying storage sizes, the optimal vector of storage sizes falls somewhere on this frontier. We present two case studies to illustrate our approach, demonstrating that a single storage technology is sometimes inadequate to meet application requirements, unlike an HESS designed using our approach. We also find simple, near-optimal, and practical operating strategies for these case studies, which allows us to gain several new engineering insights.", "authors": ["Yashar Ghiassi-Farrokhfal", "Catherine Rosenberg", "Srinivasan Keshav", "Marie-Benedicte Adjaho"], "n_citation": 12, "references": ["06d08e7c-be0a-4066-8f6b-40560211b03c", "0d4ab690-b3ad-4f13-b3e2-b22d857f9a42", "60d2624d-5f75-40bb-8faa-1d9ed93c3222", "618c32a7-1b69-412f-ad04-568035a539d4", "64e243a4-eb93-492c-b6e9-082091ecf357", "8660006e-aa31-4bee-8276-5eb694e02e06", "995aa2ec-b0ec-4125-8ba7-a7510e3deff9", "aab3ea51-59d1-4581-904f-a88116f7e963", "debc1b69-3bc3-4ab2-8175-8f02ecd509b5"], "title": "Joint Optimal Design and Operation of Hybrid Energy Storage Systems", "venue": "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications", "year": 2016, "id": "0feb0efd-79db-4a4d-881f-481db4bfe75f"}

{"abstract": "This paper introduces an approach to solving the fundamental scalability problem of all-optical packet switching wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) access networks. Current optical networks cannot be scaled by simply adding nodes to existing systems due to the accumulation of insertion losses and/or the limited number of wavelengths. Scalability through bridging requires, on the other hand, the capability to switch packets among adjacent subnetworks on a wavelength basis. Such a solution is, however, not possible due to the unavailability of fast-switching wavelength sensitive devices. In this paper, we propose a scalable WDM access network architecture based on a recently proposed optical switching approach, termed photonic slot routing. According to this approach, entire slots, each carrying multiple packets (one on each wavelength) are \"transparently\" routed through the network as single units so that wavelength sensitive data flows can be handled using fast-switching wavelength nonsensitive devices based on proven technologies. The paper shows that the photonic slot routing technique can be successfully used to achieve statistical multiplexing of the optical bandwidth in the access network, thus providing a cost-effective solution to today's increasing bandwidth demand for data transmissions.", "authors": ["Imrich Chlamtac", "Vikt\u00f3ria Elek", "Andrea Fumagalli", "Csaba A.

{"abstract": "Facial expression recognition is necessary for designing any realistic human-machine interfaces. Previous published facial expression recognition systems achieve good recognition rates, but most of them perform well only when the user faces the camera and does not change his 3D head pose. We propose a new method for robust, view-independent recognition of facial expressions that does not make this assumption. The system uses a novel 3D model-based tracker to extract simultaneously and robustly the pose and shape of the face at every frame of a monocular video sequence. There are two main contributions. First, we demonstrate that the 3D information extracted through 3D tracking enables robust facial expression recognition in spite of large rotational and translational head movements (up to 90 degrees in head rotation). Second, we show that the Support Vector Machine is a suitable engine for robust classification. Recognition rates as high as 91 percent are achieved at classifying 5 distinct dynamic facial motions (neutral, opening/closing mouth, smile, raising eyebrow).", "authors": ["Salih Burak Gokturk", "Jean-Yves Bouguet", "Carlo Tomasi", "Bernd Girod"], "n_citation": 124, "references": ["0af64f19-7189-4545-a647-ec3d9ec5c98e", "0b34cfd9-0359-4078-921e-3f9bfbb4dcfa", "11cb147e-ad1e-421f-a8bd-b491cc18237a", "1549ade8-0a2a-4d82-8fa9-b73305dff38c", "2da8025a-06d3-41f6-8b93-917219ad9792", "31b6a50a-c6ec-421d-965c-43b1df24b8f2", "32148a0b-6ce4-4a1e-a1d2-98a96b27b24f", "4db6c10f-b1bb-49c2-b00c-bca8425aa979", "5e654ac4-90ef-4b1c-85d2-03bee2ab27bf", "60cf9842-c3aa-463d-a5cf-17fbb8f99ccd", "646667d7-090b-4500-900c-5bfaf4666061", "732f1cb3-c0c3-40de-bdd0-40de75ec3a66", "94cb26be-2bfa-4e76-b480-521858d9848e", "a4f25346-f769-4166-9337-abdd19987bf5", "c9fa31f7-f6ce-49ea-b42c-8d03ae59dbe4", "d6486b7a-4c54-417b-b25e-8bb94d2ad4b8", "da19c758-4c30-472b-91e4-3ef0c4b8270f", "f6c418d7-c420-492f-8d24-de3827674b93"], "title": "Model-based face tracking for view-independent facial expression recognition", "venue": "ieee international conference on automatic face and gesture recognition", "year": 2002, "id": "ff9b981f-d03f-46e6-8bc1-41baffdad106"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, we develop a unified framework for linear nonregenerative multicarrier multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) relay communications in the absence of the direct source-destination link. This unified framework classifies most commonly used design objectives such as the minimal mean-square error and the maximal mutual information into two categories: Schur-concave and Schur-convex functions. We prove that for Schur-concave objective functions, the optimal source precoding matrix and relay amplifying matrix jointly diagonalize the source-relay-destination channel matrix and convert the multicarrier MIMO relay channel into parallel single-input single-output (SISO) relay channels. While for Schur-convex objectives, such joint diagonalization occurs after a specific rotation of the source precoding matrix. After the optimal structure of the source and relay matrices is determined, the linear nonregenerative relay design problem boils down to the issue of power loading among the resulting SISO relay channels. We show that this power loading problem can be efficiently solved by an alternating technique.

The paper then presents an algorithm for enforcing causal message ordering. The algorithm allows a process to multicast to arbitrary and dynamically changing process groups. We show that the algorithm is optimal in the space complexity of the overhead of control information in both messages and message logs. The algorithm achieves optimality by transmitting the bare minimum causal dependency information specified by the necessity conditions, and using an encoding scheme to represent and transmit this information. We show that, in general, the space complexity of causal message ordering in an asynchronous system is \u03a9(n2), where n is the number of nodes in the system.

Examples of its uses include support for interaction via bi-directional chat-like facilities as well as support for uni-directional notifications, for example push-based information from services such as WWW and email, and notifications of the activities of others through rooms bookings, version control changes, and so on. These uses have had a significant impact on the way people interact with information sources and on social cohesion within the organisation. The attraction of Elvin lies in its conceptual simplicity, absence of built-in policy, expressive power and multilingual range of simple APIs. Its uptake is largely a result of the Tickertape Elvin client, which provides a simple, compelling interface usable in numerous different situations.

{"abstract": "The literature on programming sensor networks has focused so far on providing higher-level abstractions for expressing local node behavior. Kairos is a natural next step in sensor network programming in that it allows the programmer to express, in a centralized fashion, the desired global behavior of a distributed computation on the entire sensor network. Kairos' compile-time and runtime subsystems expose a small set of programming primitives, while hiding from the programmer the details of distributed-code generation and instantiation, remote data access and management, and inter-node program flow coordination. In this paper, we describe Kairos' programming model, and demonstrate its suitability, through actual implementation, for a variety of distributed programs-both infrastructure services and signal processing tasks-typically encountered in sensor network literature: routing tree construction, localization, and object tracking. Our experimental results suggest that Kairos does not adversely affect the performance or accuracy of distributed programs, while our implementation experiences suggest that it greatly raises the level of abstraction presented to the programmer.", "authors": ["Ramakrishna Gummadi", "Omprakash Gnawali", "Ramesh Govindan"], "n_citation": 342, "references": ["105314df-68a1-40e0-b793-af225567b50c", "1dd8c68d-3b20-4171-9245-3a12c64c2838", "22afbdac-6078-4ede-9490-d65b524b9208", "32b7988a-f873-44c9-bacb-0d660fe12f01", "45f5db3f-dd33-41a7-bd34-2b76dac19242", "52f395e6-8017-4058-b53f-17eba7b7c0d1", "5ec580c0-cbe2-4be4-87b0-342d7a573959", "612910b7-24f8-4f67-9d3d-a2814b7c15f8", "6bfdf9a3-6cd9-43d8-9785-0073dbe96f1b", "801f0553-588b-436e-9db6-a3dabd4dc279", "823b27e8-e3f3-423e-8c43-bbaac2c62a4e", "84dc5aaa-7b2c-4f15-97f4-aa867b4328e2", "96b245c2-47a5-4aec-89f0-d2a362124845", "9efda63c-320d-46b0-8a7b-175012a2936f", "9f68e270-0e36-47f8-bb1c-46cad55d99ef", "aca9066f-9450-45ba-9de1-b6070d848c79", "afc06b7c-7fb3-4f88-942b-3076ed77920e", "b02a7fb7-cbf2-4d57-b957-b4260436f4d3", "b7821cb8-f51c-4dc4-a37d-52f64233bdaf", "be845365-42d5-4606-b02c-f7ab34b1d2d6", "c075f11b-4ea0-4642-9910-17b3524667a8", "c612186c-bd56-4817-abfd-564f64467f56", "df27d080-fd4b-4661-aaba-78ef68a87b52", "ee4d57a4-27c5-4378-9ef1-28720f2318c6", "efa04de8-fec3-4c73-8031-5b7990b88e57", "f682f022-3c5c-4638-a9d4-5b08bfa136a1"], "title": "Macro-programming Wireless Sensor Networks Using Kairos", "venue": "distributed computing in sensor systems", "year": 2005, "id": "cb57d1d2-076e-4a01-bb4e-52a1904f26b4"}

First, the image is decomposed into two equal area sub-images based on its original probability density function. Then the two sub-images are equalized respectively. Finally, we obtain the results after the processed sub-images are composed into one image.

Despite being simple, a static division of resources between virtual networks can be highly inefficient, while dynamic resource allocation runs the risk of instability. This paper uses optimization theory to show that adaptive resource allocation can be stable and can maximize the aggregate performance across the virtual networks. In the DaVinci architecture, each substrate link periodically reassigns bandwidth shares between its virtual links; while at a smaller timescale, each virtual network runs a distributed protocol that maximizes its own performance objective independently. Numerical experiments with a mix of delay-sensitive and throughput-sensitive traffic show that the bandwidth shares converge quickly to the optimal values. We demonstrate that running several custom protocols in parallel and allocating resource adaptively can be more efficient, more flexible, and easier to manage than a compromise \"one-size-fits-all\" design.", "authors": ["Jiayue He", "Rui Zhang-Shen", "Ying Li", "Cheng-Yen Lee", "Jennifer Rexford", "Mung Chiang"], "n_citation": 184, "references": ["0152d24f-3b31-4605-8604-ca09b5849d8d", "0c02d602-cf05-47c5-9643-65cb255d75be", "130bc8d8-4652-4aee-822b-ba6d661d7f4c", "26be0d8f-cbe9-431b-bd28-dfcac4a6dd31", "280c8638-e6c3-4871-8e4e-08f60883763c", "2ba18e0c-15c3-482c-ae5f-8099ecd896fd", "5347c4dd-9ca7-4d3d-b1b7-b81e9326a5a2", "559c2078-b2d3-4fd7-b80c-04620a34f942", "68abec2e-8426-418b-a104-25f7ff70c93b", "6eff83a4-db80-40ea-8c9f-8bda5f506c29", "73f87eee-5b27-4532-9520-70b65816a525", "7cc9ac7a-2280-4162-94b4-c4feb06e59d1", "8a54a324-bec6-4ee5-b7a8-1491f357ee0c", "a369afee-a619-4e9a-9250-5fd2b06e8a05", "c53af659-197f-4fcf-9068-566b4ee09a20", "d0f7b50c-1ce7-400a-a120-43b1c8f3bcbe", "d18ec9f6-410d-40ed-b743-a7b717fcdaf0", "dc5597ee-5ef7-4ab0-918b-149aec9c6568", "e3b1b9d3-275a-4c07-bddd-d1f07c9f99d7", "e87fa0b9-572f-4019-94ce-30d235a2d3df"], "title": "DaVinci: dynamically adaptive virtual networks for a customized internet", "venue": "conference on emerging network experiment and technology", "year": 2008, "id": "9dbb02dd-14d1-4ab3-8289-034e7ab20a9f"}

Once the necessary modeling stage is performed, the framework becomes one of automatic control, and stability and robustness questions arise.

The interaction screw is thus defined in a general way, and the application to images follows. Starting from the concept of task function, the general framework of the control is described, and stability results are recalled. The concept of the hybrid task is presented and then applied to visual sensors. Simulation and experimental results are presented, and guidelines for future work are drawn in the conclusion. >", "authors": ["Bernard Espiau", "Fran\u00e7ois Chaumette", "Patrick Rives"], "n_citation": 1861, "references": ["3bfca998-a14a-480a-9774-7ec03192c388", "3c8c9b68-e229-4143-9b23-85d02d92f223", "4995fcd0-d9a4-40e5-8621-6c736171ab02", "6b006c40-7d45-4378-a4e4-ce48e2c69357", "871711a0-af63-42fd-96b8-2a82c739faf1", "886fd600-6744-4ab0-b993-9ee6391892a3", "99a5fa3a-b423-4106-a40d-569f6a4af300", "9d36b893-f09e-4f5d-832d-3f1c8a4238f1", "afcb579b-bd21-44c1-8073-8d66f8a35f25", "b1513250-8b7b-42c6-9ba0-46cd4a83437e", "b3463278-635c-4833-8781-cb10371760f5", "bc0a29f8-ad18-4654-beb6-c33ca30f2043", "c1dac0bc-5f49-4e39-8837-09c2a40f6686"], "title": "A new approach to visual servoing in robotics", "venue": "international conference on robotics and automation", "year": 1992, "id": "dbf78aff-2d5f-4caa-a797-2719ae1e4812"}
{"abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel technique for constructing timed automata from properties expressed in the logic MTL, under bounded-variability assumptions. We handle full MTL and include all future operators. Our construction is based on separation of the continuous time monitoring of the input sequence and discrete predictions regarding the future. The separation of the continuous from the discrete allows us to determinize our automata in an exponential construction that does not increase the number of clocks. This leads to a doubly exponential construction from MTL to deterministic timed automata, compared with triply exponential using existing approaches.#R##N##R##N#We offer an alternative to the existing approach to linear real-time model checking, which has never been implemented.

Here we present evidence as to how the cost of computing one kind of inference is directly related to the expressiveness of the representation language.

{"abstract": "The introduction of computers into the control of potentially dangerous devices has led to a growing awareness of the possible contribution of software to serious accidents. The number of computer-related accidents so far has been small due to the restraint shown in introducing computers into safety-critical control loops. However, as the economic and technological benefits of using computers become more widely accepted, their use is increasing dramatically. We need to ensure that computers are introduced into safety-critical systems in the most responsible way possible and at a speed that does not expose people to undue risk. Risk induced by technological innovation existed long before computers; this is not the first time that humans have come up with an extremely useful new technology that is potentially dangerous.

Therefore, we developed the processing of maps (PROMAP) system, which incorporates adequate image analysis. The system can generate a symbolic description of the map that can be imported into a GIS. A color scanner generates a multicolor raster image of the map. This image is split into layers of predefined map colors. Each layer is vectorized and methods like neural network-based symbol and object recognition for the extraction of attributed structure primitives and knowledge-directed image interpretation are applied. The map scene is structured hierarchically. The interface to the GIS is represented by the map objects at the upper levels of hierarchy.

{"abstract": "Transaction data is ubiquitous in data mining applications. Examples include market basket data in retail commerce, telephone call records in telecommunications, and Web logs of individual page-requests at Web sites. Profiling consists of using historical transaction data on individuals to construct a model of each individual's behavior. Simple profiling techniques such as histograms do not generalize well from sparse transaction data. In this paper we investigate the application of probabilistic mixture models to automatically generate profiles from large volumes of transaction data. In effect, the mixture model represents each individual's behavior as a linear combination of \"basis transactions.\" We evaluate several variations of the model on a large retail transaction data set and show that the proposed model provides improved predictive power over simpler histogram-based techniques, as well as being relatively scalable, interpretable, and flexible. In addition we point to applications in outlier detection, customer ranking, interactive visualization, and so forth.

Ontologies support the creation of conceptual models and help with information integration. In this paper, we propose a way to link the formal representation of semantics (i.e., ontologies) to conceptual schemas describing information stored in databases. The main result is a formal framework that explains a mapping between a spatial ontology and a geographic conceptual schema. The mapping of ontologies to conceptual schemas is made using three different levels of abstraction: formal, domain, and application levels. At the formal level, highly abstract concepts are used to express the schema and the ontologies. At the domain level, the schema is regarded as an instance of a generic data model. At the application level, we focus on the particular case of geographic applications. We also discuss the influence of ontologies in both the traditional and geographic systems development methodologies, with an emphasis on the conceptual design phase.", "authors": ["Frederico T.

{"abstract": "Describes an approach to building a distributed software component system for scientific and engineering applications that is based on representing Computational Grid services as application-level software components. These Grid services provide tools such as registry and directory services, event services and remote component creation. While a service-based architecture for grids and other distributed systems is not new, this framework provides several unique features. First, the public interfaces to each software component are described as XML documents. This allows many adaptors and user interfaces to be generated from the specification dynamically. Second, this system is designed to exploit the resources of existing Grid infrastructures like Globus and Legion, and commercial Internet frameworks like e-speak. Third, and most important, the component-based design extends throughout the system. Hence, tools such as application builders, which allow users to select components, start them on remote resources, and connect and execute them, are also interchangeable software components.

{"abstract": "We have developed a preliminary version of a foveated imaging system, implemented on a general purpose computer, which greatly reduces the transmission bandwidth of images. The system is based on the fact that the spatial resolution of the human eye is space variant, decreasing with increasing eccentricity from the point of gaze. By taking advantage of this fact, it is possible to create an image that is almost perceptually indistinguishable from a constant resolution image, but requires substantially less information to code it. This is accomplished by degrading the resolution of the image so that it matches the space-variant degradation in the resolution of the human eye. Eye movements are recorded so that the high resolution region of the image can be kept aligned with the high resolution region of the human visual system. This system has demonstrated that significant reductions in bandwidth can be achieved while still maintaining access to high detail at any point in an image. The system has been tested using 256 by 256 8 bit gray scale images with a 20 degree field-of-view and eye-movement update rates of 30 Hz (display refresh was 60 Hz). users of the system have reported minimal perceptual artifacts at bandwidth reductions of up to 94.7% (a factor of 18.8).

In this paper we will review the limitations of current \"agent-local\" approaches to exception handling in agent systems, and propose an alternative approach based on a shared exception handling service that is \"plugged\", with little or no customization, into existing agent systems. This service can be viewed as a kind of \"coordination doctor\"; it knows about the different ways multi-agent systems can get \"sick\", actively looks system-wide for symptoms of such \"illnesses\", and prescribes specific interventions instantiated for this particular context from a body of general treatment procedures.

The conventional approaches to address this issue consider the two aspects of the problem disjointly by first finding a route from a predetermined set of candidate paths and then searching for an appropriate wavelength assignment. We adopt a more general approach in which we consider all paths between a source-destination (s-d) pair and incorporate network state information into the routing decision. This approach performs routing and wavelength assignment jointly and adaptively, and outperforms fixed routing techniques. We present adaptive routing and wavelength assignment algorithms and evaluate their blocking performance. We obtain an analytical technique to compute approximate blocking probabilities for networks employing fixed and alternate routing. The analysis can also accommodate networks with multiple fibers per link.

The algorithm attains an $\\varepsilon$-approximately optimal policy with probability $1-\\delta$ using samples (i.e. observations), time and space that grow polynomially with the size of the MDP, the size of the automaton expressing the temporal logic specification, $\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}$, $\\frac{1}{\\delta}$ and a finite time horizon. In this approach, the system maintains a model of the initially unknown MDP, and constructs a product MDP based on its learned model and the specification automaton that expresses the temporal logic constraints. During execution, the policy is iteratively updated using observation of the transitions taken by the system. The iteration terminates in finitely many steps. With high probability, the resulting policy is such that, for any state, the difference between the probability of satisfying the specification under this policy and the optimal one is within a predefined bound.", "authors": ["Jie Fu", "Ufuk Topcu"], "n_citation": 35, "references": ["121011f2-dbef-41e2-8b28-23f6971f5f06", "3407752c-bf0f-40b6-b319-7455a0ade131", "3a3be31f-35f2-4217-8e00-e46300ec3572", "3c9916ca-88ae-4182-94b6-c0bf18b931f3", "4e52e67e-4f6d-46ba-979e-d49dc465ead6", "59eaf752-d8da-48ac-ad07-ec549e75c732", "62a074d0-3ff5-405d-8e57-b22060f46a90", "71bd6cb1-d628-4a3c-a5cc-6e6515d52107", "909959f2-2853-41e4-925f-f00cc1d659d8", "abc04791-2b81-4ecd-99a8-0d44e8c09b8e", "d1ef8e3b-d23f-479c-87f4-b82688cec22c", "e92be72a-2a55-46a3-8032-9691cc32643e", "f1029115-54b8-42a1-a30c-9e76a2fcc3c7"], "title": "Probably Approximately Correct MDP Learning and Control With Temporal Logic Constraints", "venue": "robotics science and systems", "year": 2014, "id": "a1c91837-5299-4c58-8bf7-3142a2ffe0d6"}

{"abstract": "The process algebra CSP is designed for specifying interactions between concurrent systems. In CSP, and related languages, concurrent processes synchronise on common events, while the internal operations of the individual processes are treated abstractly. In some contexts, however, such as when modelling systems of systems, it is desirable to model both interprocess communications as well as the internal operations of individual processes. At the implementation level, shared state is often the method of communication between processes, and tests and updates of local state are used to implement internal operations. In this paper we propose an extension of the CSP language which maintains CSP's core elegance in specifying process synchronisation, while also allowing state-based behaviour. State is treated  hierarchically  , allowing (nested) declarations of local and shared variables. The state can be accessed and modified using a refinement calculus-style  specification command  , which may be optionally paired with event synchronisation. The semantics of the extended language, preserves the original CSP rules. The approach we present is novel in that state is part of the process, rather than a meta-level construct appearing only in the rules.", "authors": ["Robert Colvin", "Ian J.

The authors investigate the use of regular virtual topologies as an efficient solution that incorporates the above hardware limitations, while providing high system utilization and low end-to-end delays. The following regular topologies are investigated: Shufflenet, binary hypercube, generalized hypercube, and two-dimensional torus. A number of performance and hardware related metrics are introduced that reflect the use of these topologies in a high speed optical environment. Based on these metrics, along with upper and lower bounds developed for performance and hardware requirements, the authors evaluate and compare the selected regular topologies. They also address the issue of mapping the regular virtual topologies into a WDM star network. >", "authors": ["Bo Li", "Aura Ganz"], "n_citation": 70, "references": ["11c384f5-1db5-424e-b273-d13f63076d77", "18d13697-4140-4ecb-bfde-95a956d38a62", "268c0f23-e247-40b2-a0d4-43b96820d7c2", "e78c7a75-dd3a-4bd5-ad43-191df0f006d3"], "title": "Virtual topologies for WDM star LANs-the regular structures approach", "venue": "international conference on computer communications", "year": 1992, "id": "48d97b20-48ee-4537-941a-5bb77096808c"}

{"abstract": "The model reduction problem for networks of interconnected dynamical systems is studied in this paper. In particular, networks of identical passive subsystems, which are coupled according to a tree topology, are considered. For such networked systems, reduction is performed by clustering subsystems that show similar behavior and subsequently aggregating their states, leading to a reduced-order networked system that allows for an insightful physical interpretation. The clusters are chosen on the basis of the analysis of controllability and observability properties of associated edge systems, representing the importance of the couplings and providing a measure of the similarity of the behavior of neighboring subsystems. This reduction procedure is shown to preserve synchronization properties (i.e., the convergence of the subsystem trajectories to each other) and allows for the  a priori  computation of a bound on the reduction error with respect to external inputs and outputs.

We evaluated the performance of these mechanisms under combinations of two foreground workloads (light and heavy) and two levels of available network bandwidth (10 Mb/s and 100 Mb/s).

{"abstract": "This paper describes JCCap, a protection facility for cooperating appli\u00ad cations in the context of Java Card. It enables the control of access rights between mutually suspicious applications, either between one terminal application and one Java Card applet or between two applets hosted inside the same Java Card. Using JCCap, access to objects is controlled by means of software capabilities that can be exchanged between mutu\u00ad ally suspicious applications. An important advantage of JCCap is that the definition of the protection policy of an application (i.e., how ac\u00ad cess rights are granted to other applications) is completely separated from the application code. The protection policy is described in an ex\u00ad tended Interface Definition Language (IDL) at the interface level, thus enhancing modularity, separation of concerns, and ease of expression in the design of the overall security architecture. Each application can define its own protection policy independently from the other appli\u00ad cations, thus enabling the expression of mutual suspicion without any prior knowledge about the policies of other applications. Every protec\u00ad tion policy is then applied when applications interact with each other. This paper describes the implementation of a prototype of JCCap.

{"abstract": "Background#R##N#High-throughput molecular interaction data have been used effectively to prioritize candidate genes that are linked to a disease, based on the observation that the products of genes associated with similar diseases are likely to interact with each other heavily in a network of protein-protein interactions (PPIs). An important challenge for these applications, however, is the incomplete and noisy nature of PPI data.

{"abstract": "Abstract During the last decade, cell phones with multimodal interfaces based on combined new media have become the dominant computer interface worldwide. Multimodal interfaces support mobility and expand the expressive power of human input to computers. They have shifted the fulcrum of human-computer interaction much closer to the human. This book explains the foundation of human-centered multimodal interaction and interface design, based on the cognitive and neurosciences, as well as the major benefits of multimodal interfaces for human cognition and performance. It describes the data-intensive methodologies used to envision, prototype, and evaluate new multimodal interfaces. From a system development viewpoint, this book outlines major approaches for multimodal signal processing, fusion, architectures, and techniques for robustly interpreting users' meaning. Multimodal interfaces have been commercialized extensively for field and mobile applications during the last decade. Research also is growing rapi...", "authors": ["Sharon L. Oviatt", "Philip R.

{"abstract": "Technical debt is the technical work developers owe a system, typically caused by speeding up development, e.g. before a software release. Approaches, such as code smell detection, have been developed to identify particular kinds of debt, e.g. design debt. Up until now, code smell detection has been used to help point to components that need to be freed from debt by refactoring. To date, a number of methods have been described for finding code smells in a system. However, typical debt properties, such as the value of the debt and interest rate to be paid, have not been well established. This position paper proposes an approach to using cost/benefit analysis to prioritize technical debt reduction work by ranking the value and interest of design debt caused by god classes. The method is based on metric analysis and software repository mining and is demonstrated on a commercial software application at a mid-size development company. The results are promising: the method helps to identify which refactoring activities should be performed first because they are likely to be cheap to make yet have significant effect, and which refactorings should be postponed due to high cost and low payoff.", "authors": ["Nico Zazworka", "Carolyn B.

{"abstract": "How can we find data for quality prediction? Early in the life cycle, projects may lack the data needed to build such predictors. Prior work assumed that relevant training data was found nearest to the local project. But is this the best approach? This paper introduces the Peters filter which is based on the following conjecture: When local data is scarce, more information exists in other projects. Accordingly, this filter selects training data via the structure of other projects. To assess the performance of the Peters filter, we compare it with two other approaches for quality prediction. Within-company learning and cross-company learning with the Burak filter (the state-of-the-art relevancy filter). This paper finds that: 1) within-company predictors are weak for small data-sets; 2) the Peters filter+cross-company builds better predictors than both within-company and the Burak filter+cross-company; and 3) the Peters filter builds 64% more useful predictors than both within-company and the Burak filter+cross-company approaches.

In this paper, we examine the question: Using current commercially available technology, is it practical to build such a server, for real databases of realistic size, that offers reasonable performance--scaling well, parallelizing well, working with the current client infrastructure, and enabling server operators of otherwise unknown credibility to prove their service has these privacy properties? We consider this problem in the light of commercially available secure coprocessors--whose internal memory is still much, much smaller than the typical database size--and construct an algorithm that both provides asymptotically optimal performance and also promises reasonable performance in real implementations.

{"abstract": "Case-oriented workflow modeling provides flexibility in specifying and executing workflows because it is possible to consider unique, organization-specific business process conditions and thereby minimize exceptions. However, it is a laborious task for a workflow designer to derive a case-oriented workflow model from a business specification, resulting in high modeling overhead. Recent commercial systems are providing generic templates of common business processes which may be adapted to an organizations requirements. These templates, called cases, can be modified individually or multiple cases may be composed into a more complex workflow and then the assembled workflow may be modified as needed to meet the business specification.

The resulting wavelet coefficient frames are modified by a perceptually shaped pseudorandom sequence representing the author. The noise-like watermark is statistically undetectable to thwart unauthorized removal. Furthermore, the author representation resolves the deadlock problem.

The Hoare approach is presented via a discussion of its embodiment in the programming language Euclid.

{"abstract": "It is well-known that linear dynamical systems with Gaussian noise and quadratic cost (LQG) satisfy a separation principle. Finding the optimal controller amounts to solving separate dual problems; one for control and one for estimation. For the discrete-time finite-horizon case, each problem is a simple forward or backward recursion. In this paper, we consider a generalization of the LQG problem with two controllers and a partially nested information structure. Each controller is responsible for one of two system inputs, but has access to different subsets of the available measurements. Our paper has three main contributions. First, we prove a fundamental structural result: sufficient statistics for the controllers can be expressed as conditional means of the global state.

These formulae are reminiscent of the classical LQG solution with dual forward and backward recursions, but with the important difference that they are intricately coupled.

{"abstract": "Communication is usually the most energy-consuming event in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). One way to significantly reduce energy consumption is applying transmission power control (TPC) techniques to dynamically adjust the transmission power. This article presents two new TPC techniques for WSNs. The experimental evaluation compares the performance of the TCP techniques with B-MAC, the standard MAC protocol of the Mica 2 platform. These experiments take into account different distances among nodes, concurrent transmissions and node mobility. The new transmission power control techniques decrease energy consumption by up to 57% over B-MAC while maintaining the reliability of the channel. Under a low mobility scenario, the proposed protocols delivered up to 95% of the packets, showing that such methods are able to cope with node movement. We also show that the contention caused by higher transmission levels might be lower than analytical models suggest, due to the action of the capture effect.", "authors": ["Luiz Henrique A.

{"abstract": "The aim of the present paper is to provide an optimal solution to the H^2 state-feedback and output-feedback control problems for stochastic linear systems subjected both to Markov jumps and to multiplicative white noise. It is proved that in the state-feedback case the optimal solution is a static gain which is also optimal in the class of all higher-order controllers. In the output-feedback case the optimal H^2 controller has the same order as the given stochastic system. The realization of the optimal controllers depend on the stabilizing solutions of some appropriate systems of Riccati-type coupled equations. An effective iterative convergent algorithm to compute these stabilizing solutions is also presented.

{"abstract": "We show how a standard tool from statistics --- namely confidence bounds --- can be used to elegantly deal with situations which exhibit an exploitation-exploration trade-off. Our technique for designing and analyzing algorithms for such situations is general and can be applied when an algorithm has to make exploitation-versus-exploration decisions based on uncertain information provided by a random process. We apply our technique to two models with such an exploitation-exploration trade-off. For the adversarial bandit problem with shifting our new algorithm suffers only O((ST)1/2) regret with high probability over T trials with S shifts. Such a regret bound was previously known only in expectation. The second model we consider is associative reinforcement learning with linear value functions.

{"abstract": "Destination-based forwarding in traditional IP routers has not been able to take full advantage of multiple paths that frequently exist in Internet service provider networks. As a result, the networks may not operate efficiently, especially when the traffic patterns are dynamic. This paper describes a multipath adaptive traffic engineering scheme, called MATE, which is targeted for switched networks such as multiprotocol label switching networks. The main goal of MATE is to avoid network congestion by adaptively balancing the load among multiple paths based on measurement and analysis of path congestion. MATE adopts a minimalist approach in that intermediate nodes are not required to perform traffic engineering or measurements besides forwarding packets. Moreover, MATE does not impose any particular scheduling, buffer management, or a priori traffic characterization on the nodes. This paper presents an analytical model, derives a class of MATE algorithms, and proves their convergence. Several practical design techniques to implement MATE are described. Simulation results are provided to illustrate the efficacy of MATE under various network scenarios.", "authors": ["Anwar Elwalid", "Cheng Jin", "Steven H.

{"abstract": "In the matching tasks which form an integral part of all types of tracking and geometrical vision, there are invariably priors available on the absolute and/or relative image locations of features of interest. Usually, these priors are used post-hoc in the process of resolving feature matches and obtaining final scene estimates, via `first get candidate matches, then resolve' consensus algorithms such as RANSAC. In this paper we show that the dramatically different approach of using priors dynamically to guide a feature by feature matching search can achieve global matching with much fewer image processing operations and lower overall computational cost. Essentially, we put image processing  into the loop of the search for global consensus. In particular, our approach is able to cope with significant image ambiguity thanks to a dynamic mixture of Gaussians treatment. In our fully Bayesian algorithm, the choice of the most efficient search action at each step is guided intuitively and rigorously by expected Shannon information gain. We demonstrate the algorithm in feature matching as part of a sequential SLAM system for 3D camera tracking. Robust, real-time matching can be achieved even in the previously unmanageable case of jerky, rapid motion necessitating weak motion modelling and large search regions.", "authors": ["Margarita Chli", "Andrew J.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a new approach to the problem of simultaneously localizing a group of mobile robots capable of sensing one another. Each of the robots collects sensor data regarding its own motion and shares this information with the rest of the team during the update cycles. A single estimator, in the form of a Kalman filter, processes the available positioning information from all the members of the team and produces a pose estimate for every one of them. The equations for this centralized estimator can be written in a decentralized form, therefore allowing this single Kalman filter to be decomposed into a number of smaller communicating filters. Each of these filters processes the sensor data collected by its host robot. Exchange of information between the individual filters is necessary only when two robots detect each other and measure their relative pose. The resulting decentralized estimation schema, which we call collective localization, constitutes a unique means for fusing measurements collected from a variety of sensors with minimal communication and processing requirements. The distributed localization algorithm is applied to a group of three robots and the improvement in localization accuracy is presented.

{"abstract": "Many organizations attempt to deploy methodologies intended to improve software development processes. However, resistance by individual software developers against using such methodologies often obstructs their successful deployment. To better explain why individual developers accept or resist methodologies, five theoretical models of individual intentions to accept information technology tools were examined. In a field study of 128 developers in a large organization that implemented a methodology, each model explained significant variance in developers' intentions to use the methodology. Similar to findings from the tool adoption context, we found that, if a methodology is not regarded as useful by developers, its prospects for successful deployment may be severely undermined. In contrast to the typical pattern of findings in a tool context, however, we found that methodology adoption intentions are driven by: 1) the presence of an organizational mandate to use the methodology, 2) the compatibility of the methodology with how developers perform their work, and 3) the opinions of developers' coworkers and supervisors toward using the methodology. Collectively, these results provide surprising new insights into why software developers accept or resist methodologies and suggest what software engineering managers might do to overcome developer resistance.", "authors": ["Cynthia K.

{"abstract": "A neural network architecture for the learning of recognition categories is derived. Real-time network dynamics are completely characterized through mathematical analysis and computer simulations. The architecture self-organizes and self-stabilizes its recognition codes in response to arbitrary orderings of arbitrarily many and arbitrarily complex binary input patterns. Top-down attentional and matching mechanisms are critical in self-stabilizing the code learning process. The architecture embodies a parallel search scheme which updates itself adaptively as the learning process unfolds. After learning self-stabilizes, the search process is automatically disengaged. Thereafter input patterns directly access their recognition codes without any search. Thus recognition time does not grow as a function of code complexity. A novel input pattern can directly access a category if it shares invariant properties with the set of familiar exemplars of that category. These invariant properties emerge in the form of learned critical feature patterns, or prototypes. The architecture possesses a context-sensitive self-scaling property which enables its emergent critical feature patterns to form. They detect and remember statistically predictive configurations of featural elements which are derived from the set of all input patterns that are ever experienced. Four types of attentional process\u2014priming, gain control, vigilance, and intermodal competition\u2014are mechanistically characterized. Top\u2014down priming and gain control are needed for code matching and self-stabilization. Attentional vigilance determines how fine the learned categories will be. If vigilance increases due to an environmental disconfirmation, then the system automatically searches for and learns finer recognition categories. A new nonlinear matching law (the \u2154 Rule) and new nonlinear associative laws (the Weber Law Rule, the Associative Decay Rule, and the Template Learning Rule) are needed to achieve these properties. All the rules describe emergent properties of parallel network interactions. The architecture circumvents the noise, saturation, capacity, orthogonality, and linear predictability constraints that limit the codes which can be stably learned by alternative recognition models.", "authors": ["Gail A.

{"abstract": "The multimedia metamodel defines platform-independent multimedia concepts, opening the way for novel approaches to designing content repurposing solutions. Designers can use the metamodel to create content and add metadata to existing content, simplifying content analysis and repurposing. This model-driven approach and proposed design solutions are useful not only for many multimedia designers and researchers, where the model-driven tools can help them create better multimedia interfaces, but also for lecturers and students of multimedia courses. In the latter case, the unified multimedia metamodel offers context for sometimes subtle relationships between multimedia concepts. The metamodel can also facilitate the collaborative creation of broader knowledge about multimedia phenomena. In our future work, we plan to extend the proposed metamodel and include domains from related fields, such as user modeling and intelligent tutoring systems that deal with high-level user models. We are also designing multimodal test environments, reusable multimedia components, and data mining tools for evaluating various aspects of multimedia and multimodal communication.", "authors": ["Zeljko Obrenovic", "Dusan Starcevic", "Bran Selic"], "n_citation": 60, "references": ["0ec9568a-a0cb-4bdd-b832-3f1fd89807a7", "1af0a3f4-c819-48db-8a29-628654a9099f", "35a86f97-8454-4b1a-8113-dcca38d42425", "6037ac14-c7d2-4ba1-bc56-49581f4d1cb7", "8d69c462-cd5d-4273-b9a6-10f1b7b7e1ae", "a8372e70-94ac-4bec-bb74-c2295e682098", "b2368d00-1cbb-490b-94b2-34dcb36b1713", "d2175ec8-5a3a-4f5a-9cd4-e7d8e75cc4a6", "dc16b1d4-9297-462e-b709-422f15c3a867"], "title": "A model-driven approach to content repurposing", "venue": "IEEE MultiMedia", "year": 2004, "id": "6e442bd0-d376-4561-bd67-19cc1d9dad3e"}

All transformations preserve the property of free-choiceness, thus enabling the use of structural methods for the synthesis of asynchronous circuits.

The selection of the Bluetooth masters is driven by the suitability of a node to be the \"best fit\" for serving as a master. The generated topology (a scatternet, according to the Bluetooth terminology) is a connected mesh with multiple paths between any pair of nodes, thus achieving robustness.

{"abstract": "Abstract : DINO (Distributed Numerically Oriented language) is a language for writing parallel programs for distributed memory (MIND) multiprocessors. It is oriented towards expressing data parallel algorithms, which predominate in parallel numerical computation. Its goal is to make programming such algorithms natural and easy, without hindering their run-time efficiency. DINO consists of standard C augmented by several high level parallel constructs that are intended to allow the parallel program to conform to the way an algorithm designer naturally thinks about parallel algorithms. The key constructs are the ability to declare a virtual parallel computer that is best suited to the parallel computation, the ability to map distributed data structures onto this virtual machine, and the ability to define procedures that will run on each processor of the virtual machine concurrently. Most of the remaining details of distributed parallel computation, including process management and interprocessor communication, result implicitly from these high level constructs and are handled automatically by the compiler. This paper describes the syntax and semantics of the DINO language, gives examples of DINO programs, presents a critique of the DINO language features, and discusses the performance of code generated by the DINO compiler.", "authors": ["Matthew Rosing", "Robert B.

{"abstract": "Automatically constructing a complete documentary or educational film from scattered pieces of images and knowledge is a significant challenge. Even when this information is provided in an annotated format, the problems of ordering, structuring and animating sequences of images, and producing natural language descriptions that correspond to those images within multiple constraints, are each individually difficult tasks. This paper describes an approach for tackling these problems through a combination of rhetorical structures with narrative and film theory to produce movie-like visual animations from still images along with natural language generation techniques needed to produce text descriptions of what is being seen in the animations. The use of rhetorical structures from NLG is used to integrate separate components for video creation and script generation. We further describe an implementation, named Glamour, that produces actual, short video documentaries, focusing on a cultural heritage domain, and that have been evaluated by professional filmmakers.", "authors": ["Charles B.

One potential application is model predictive control. The optimization problem considered consists of a worst case quadratic performance criterion over a finite set of linear discrete-time models subject to inequality constraints on the states and control signals. The scheme has been prototyped in Matlab. To give a rough idea of the efficiencies obtained, it is possible to solve problems with more than 10 000 primal variables and 40 000 constraints on a workstation. The key to the efficient implementation is an iterative solver in conjunction with a Riccati-recursion invertible pre-conditioner for computing the search directions.", "authors": ["Anders Hansson"], "n_citation": 75, "references": ["12dab383-4fd4-40f4-b057-3df739fe6c3c", "220d0c20-5cd6-4751-8a0a-fccd7df5482a", "2f6d0e01-f223-4e00-b85b-e09d44e53315", "3bb12f05-eac9-4cb6-b17f-46c596577d65", "d5c10f26-5179-44d6-b627-79b7086c592b", "db5c8841-8b08-4449-9168-ef72f9f11684", "f25387ae-9025-409c-a8fd-a8a7c9cb23c6"], "title": "A primal-dual interior-point method for robust optimal control of linear discrete-time systems", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "year": 2000, "id": "bf41e50c-1fe2-461b-b7c5-433848ddeeea"}

{"abstract": "There have been many proposals in recent years for password-authenticated key exchange protocols.Man y of these have been shown to be insecure, and the only ones that seemed likely to be proven secure (against active adversaries who may attempt to perform off-line dictionary attacks against the password) were based on the Diffie-Hellman problem.I n fact, some protocols based on Diffie-Hellman have been recently proven secure in the random-oracle model. We examine how to design a provably-secure password-authenticated key exchange protocol based on RSA. We first look at the OKE and protected-OKE protocols (both RSA-based) and show that they are insecure.Th en we show how to modify the OKE protocol to obtain a password-authenticated key exchange protocol that can be proven secure (in the random oracle model). The resulting protocol is very practical; in fact the basic protocol requires about the same amount of computation as the Diffie-Hellman-based protocols or the well-known ssh protocol.", "authors": ["Philip D.

{"abstract": "Refactoring is a widespread practice that helps developers to improve the maintainability and readability of their code. However, there is a limited number of studies empirically investigating the actual motivations behind specific refactoring operations applied by developers. To fill this gap, we monitored Java projects hosted on GitHub to detect recently applied refactorings, and asked the developers to explain the reasons behind their decision to refactor the code. By applying thematic analysis on the collected responses, we compiled a catalogue of 44 distinct motivations for 12 well-known refactoring types.

{"abstract": "VoIP has widely been addressed as the technology that will change the Telecommunication model opening the path for convergence. Still today this revolution is far from being complete, since the majority of telephone calls are originated by circuit-oriented networks. In this paper for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we present a large dataset of measurements collected from the FastWeb backbone, which is one of the first worldwide Telecom operator to offer VoIP and high-speed data access to the end-user. Traffic characterization will focus on several layers, focusing on both end-user and ISP perspective. In particular, we highlight that, among loss, delay and jitter, only the first index may affect the VoIP call quality.

{"abstract": "We present an approach to control information flow in object-oriented systems. The decision of whether an information flow is permitted or denied depends on both the authorizations specified on the objects and the process by which information is obtained and transmitted. Depending on the specific computations, a process accessing sensitive information could still be allowed to release information to users who are not allowed to directly access it. Exceptions to the permissions and restrictions stated by the authorizations are specified by means of exceptions associated with methods. Two kinds of exceptions are considered:  invoke exceptions,  applicable during a mehtod execution and  reply exceptions  applicable to the information returned by a method.   Information flowing from one object into another or returned to the user is subject to the different exceptions specified for the methods enforcing the transmission. We formally characterize information transmission and flow in a transaction and define the conditions for safe information flow. We define security specifications and characterize safe information flows. We propose an approach to control unsafe flows and present an algorithm to enforce it.

Reconnecting the essential visuomotor sensory feedback is important for the safe practice of robotic assisted MIS procedures. This paper introduces a novel gaze contingent framework with real-time haptic feedback by transforming visual sensory information into physical constraints that can interact with the motor sensory channel. We demonstrate how motor tracking of deforming tissue can be made more effective and accurate through the concept of gaze-contingent motor channelling. The method also uses 3D eye gaze to dynamically prescribe and update safety boundaries during robotic assisted MIS without prior knowledge of the soft-tissue morphology.

{"abstract": "A system called Agora was designed and implemented that supports the development of multilanguage parallel applications for heterogeneous machines. Agora hinges on two ideas: the first one is that shared memory can be a suitable abstraction to program concurrent, multilanguage modules running on heterogeneous machines. The second idea is that a shared memory abstraction can be efficiently supported across different computer architectures that are not connected by a physical shared memory, e.g., local area network workstations or ensemble machines. Agora has been in use for more than a year. The authors describe the Agora shared memory and its software implementation on both tightly and loosely coupled architectures. Measurements of the current implementation are also included. >", "authors": ["Roberto Bisiani", "Alessandro Forin"], "n_citation": 102, "references": ["022de3b9-cfc5-4f18-b622-72d56a508670", "054986c1-43ac-4a79-984f-a81f24591bca", "485a8db9-3ed9-4203-a3bc-37306b4e7a63", "4adbd973-0a3d-4e2a-8499-6bff14108931", "4ec2b042-2b46-4152-849c-dca745128ebc", "6a5b45d6-4dcb-4c95-bb8e-a67621624947", "7108fab4-a050-4949-9a55-5f6f01f760c9", "83a10d53-2500-48aa-b8ab-47e819777ca5", "9e0a2bd3-22b5-4db9-9831-786f7b44acc4", "a7144028-f5a0-49b2-a1d5-e30053e6b7c5", "cc24b268-96b4-4a06-83af-eee9be5c7ac9", "cea4fd65-935e-4d74-b62d-80fa79beae29"], "title": "Multilanguage parallel programming of heterogeneous machines", "venue": "architectural support for programming languages and operating systems", "year": 1988, "id": "c3c26127-b24f-47df-a45a-5a64b69dab23"}

{"abstract": "Model checking is an automated technique for verifying that a system satisfies a set of required properties. Such properties are typically expressed as temporal logic formulas, in which atomic propositions are predicates over state variables of the system. In event-based system descriptions, states are not characterized by state variables, but rather by the behavior that originates in these states in terms of actions. In this context, it is natural for temporal formulas to be built from atomic propositions that are predicates on the occurrence of actions. The paper identifies limitations in this approach and introduces \"fluent\" propositions that permit formulas to naturally express properties that combine state and action. A fluent is a property of the world that holds after it is initiated by an action and ceases to hold when terminated by another action. The paper describes an approach to model checking fluent-based linear-temporal logic properties, with its implementation and application in the LTSA tool.", "authors": ["Dimitra Giannakopoulou", "Jeff Magee"], "n_citation": 214, "references": ["0ec887bb-40e7-4d96-87c9-3defa6e0a1ec", "1412ff23-1344-4034-87ac-344cc850f0b3", "160965c4-b058-47dc-a9c5-f74ec18362a0", "1a456e87-7a32-4225-abc3-1d422672e756", "28b15182-9b07-41ad-b38f-dcf0a7ba85ca", "2bb33756-67db-4329-8c0d-f3c5fdab2367", "3023929a-c93e-49c5-b03f-7fb0414d94df", "368578e7-87a6-43ae-981a-b1219e8d9ddb", "41cf9713-ed76-43a6-8e9f-538abc2f787c", "43d7ba48-d3e0-408b-baf0-3c45a1c71bea", "498bfd22-b417-4d06-9cd8-e980b58aedb3", "56af74f2-31af-4c23-86e7-e7fcf7c6177e", "61394dbb-e4c4-4b87-82e0-f0bf109afa4c", "639c0317-fd46-41d2-b855-1ae618117b73", "6527f747-563e-4e5f-b9a1-44ea23adbf26", "847ccabb-66db-4c3c-be2f-99b0d2151f6c", "85d141f0-c856-4bf6-821a-7b16768ad9e5", "91b5fdfc-9d65-4e06-9408-a7256e4dda37", "a2c74b64-0c09-491b-b619-daab62fd62d2", "d4633091-aadd-4a27-accd-344d3e773ac8", "d53a0ae2-ca8f-4d1d-a79e-0f5d68900b82", "e1470f3d-df1b-4ac1-87ac-1e45b9064a2f", "ea646192-2b16-4a56-971a-33e1ea97b8bd", "fdb4cbb6-3fb9-494c-bef8-d3260ea29879"], "title": "Fluent model checking for event-based systems", "venue": "foundations of software engineering", "year": 2003, "id": "8441111e-b7fb-497f-a359-06afd07b92df"}
{"abstract": "The analysis of business data is often an ill-defined task characterized by large amounts of noisy data. Because of this, business data analysis must combine two kinds of intertwined tasks:  exploration  and  analysis.  Exploration is the process of finding the appropriate subset of data to analyze, and analysis is the process of measuring the data to provide the business answer. While there are many tools available both for exploration and for analysis, a single tool or set of tools may not provide full support for these intertwined tasks. We report here on a project that set out to understand a specific business data analysis problem and build an environment to support it. The results of this understanding are, first of all, a detailed list of requirements of this task; second, a set of capabilities that meet these requirements; and third, an implemented client-server solution that addresses many of these requirements and identifies others for future work. Our solution incorporates several novel perspectives on data analysis and combines a history mechanism with a graphical, re-usable representation of the analysis and exploration process.

{"abstract": "Providing quality of service (QoS) assurances in a mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is difficult due to node mobility, contention for channel access, a lack of centralized co-ordination, and the unreliable nature of the wireless channel. A QoS-aware routing (QAR) protocol and an admission control (AC) protocol are two of the most important components of a system attempting to provide QoS guarantees in the face of the above mentioned difficulties faced. Many QAR and AC-based solutions have been proposed, but such network layer solutions are often designed and studied with idealized lower layer models in mind. This means that existing solutions are not designed for dealing with practical phenomena such as shadow fading and the link quality-dependent fluctuation of link transmission rates. This paper proposes and evaluates new solutions for improving the performance of QAR and AC protocols in the face of mobility, shadowing, and varying link SINR. It is found that proactively maintaining backup routes for active sessions, adapting transmission rates, and routing around temporarily low-SINR links can noticeably improve the reliability of assured throughput services.", "authors": ["I I Lajos Hanzo", "Rahim Tafazolli"], "n_citation": 56, "references": ["0d4d0363-07b5-43b6-976d-955e96044709", "1ff602d5-a4ae-4005-bae2-f1dc038b6f74", "4fbeaffb-ecb6-4f51-ade0-88b3e5cbdd68", "7b8abfd0-dd08-44e7-b1fc-4c120768259e", "82e5d611-8cc4-4383-8aad-0647f86de2e2", "8a2937f2-f0d2-40ef-a3ba-df711046ffd8", "a4ae217a-8a69-4027-ba07-957969ecfe34", "ae1029d7-3e4f-46ca-9a29-42091c20eaaf", "b04b3402-edd9-4d98-91af-fb4fbd6f0108", "bf771269-c8af-4c68-a968-761d51c362fb", "c68c6d53-40ca-4f4d-807f-defe61538bf0", "d92913b1-b6b7-4372-938e-739998f8b884", "deb37dd7-1eec-4f61-9306-bab86cc0f994", "e64f3a5c-47c3-4f15-aeb4-9662ed80e9af", "e8e2c82f-9e55-492e-b3ff-493bb64804cd", "e9099d37-cb37-4e96-8d1a-1496e0aae8d5", "edfdc92e-5223-4bf8-943e-5039033869aa"], "title": "QoS-Aware Routing and Admission Control in Shadow-Fading Environments for Multirate MANETs", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing", "year": 2011, "id": "3d90fb24-f6c8-4f75-9324-f3c28511fce4"}
{"abstract": "We present an agent-based simulation model developed to study how size, complexity and effort relate to each other in the development of open source software (OSS). In the model, many developer agents generate, extend, and re-factor code modules independently and in parallel. This accords with empirical observations of OSS development. To our knowledge, this is the first model of OSS evolution that includes the complexity of software modules as a limiting factor in productivity, the fitness of the software to its requirements, and the motivation of developers. #R##N#Validation of the model was done by comparing the simulated results against four measures of software evolution (system size, proportion of highly complex modules, level of complexity control work, and distribution of changes) for four large OSS systems. The simulated results resembled the observed data, except for system size: three of the OSS systems showed alternating patterns of super-linear and sub-linear growth, while the simulations produced only super-linear growth. However, the fidelity of the model for the other measures suggests that developer motivation and the limiting effect of complexity on productivity have a significant effect on the development of OSS systems and should be considered in any model of OSS development.", "authors": ["Neil Smith", "Andrea Capiluppi", "Juan F.

GAs are becoming more popular because of their relative simplicity and robustness. GAs are global search techniques for non-linear optimization, but they are not good at fine-tuning solutions. RSL is similar to the reinforcement learning of neural networks using random signals. It can find an accurate solution in local search space. However, it is poor at hill-climbing, whereas simulated annealing has the ability to perform probabilistic hill-climbing. Therefore, combining them yields effective hybrid algorithms, i.e. hybrid RSL algorithms, with the merits of both.

{"abstract": "Consider slide parking, given a desired demonstration, how to repeat it accurately? Many robotics tasks, such as slide parking, can be formulated in trajectory following, but not many dynamics of which can be easily modeled to facilitate a solving by the optimal control. Although an emerging stream in robotics is to learn the dynamics and policy from demonstrations, multiple, if not numerous, demonstrations are required. Therefore, learning a policy from scarce experience remains a difficult problem. In this paper, we proposed an online algorithm to learn a policy for control using only a desired demonstration and our intuitive knowledge of the dynamics system. Our approach is found on this observation: For trajectory following, even on a highly nonlinear and coupled dynamical system, so long as the state deviation is initially small, a policy can be updated online to keep the robot on track according to a very obvious and coarse model information (e.g., for driving, this information is simply: steer left to turn left). Our policy search is then devised as a function minimization problem, and is solved by gradient descent using the techniques of optimal baseline, least-state-deviation error, smoothing and in an inverse depreciation as a cost intensifier. Apart from guarantees on performance and convergence, we also demonstrated its performance in two simulations, and an extreme trajectory-following scenario - four-wheel-drive slide parking experiment.

{"abstract": "Research in process-centered environments (PCEs) has focused on project management support and has neglected method guidance for the engineers performing the (software) engineering process. It has been dominated by the search for suitable process-modeling languages and enactment mechanisms. The consequences of process orientation on the computer-based engineering environments, i.e., the interactive tools used during process performance, have been studied much less. In this article, we present the PRIME (Process Integrated Modeling Environments) framework which empowers method guidance through process-integrated tools. In contrast to the tools of PCEs, the process-integrated tools of PRIME adjust their behavior according to the current process situation and the method definitions. Process integration of PRIME tools is achieved through (1) the definition of tool models; (2) the integration of the tool models and the method definitions; (3) the interpretation of the integrated environment model by the tools, the process-aware control integration mechanism, and the enactment mechanism; and (4) the synchronization of the tools and the enactment mechanism based on a comprehensive interaction protocol. We sketch the implementation of PRIME as a reusable implementation framework which facilitates the realization of process-integrated tools as well as the process integration of external tools.  We define a six-step procedure for building a PRIME-based process-integrated environment (PIE) and illustrate how PRIME facilitates change integration on an easy-to-adapt modeling level.", "authors": ["Klaus Pohl", "Klaus Weidenhaupt", "Ralf D\u00f6mges", "Peter Haumer", "Matthias Jarke", "Ralf Klamma"], "n_citation": 111, "references": ["0b9ac3a1-01af-42a5-af12-85d7189ea8eb", "0c5c8cf3-8767-47e6-bbdb-5dd85b0c0ef0", "0d261b6a-c94a-4d5e-b44e-eb6ae46581fc", "16cb56b3-4b78-44a0-b115-793f4c62d021", "17ec67ed-67cd-4075-9d2d-9e9d8c976aa1", "2b6f4958-752b-45bb-ae52-3ab1b56c0dea", "2cde3231-5ee8-409b-99ff-9c54547be4e3", "3d782116-940c-4b83-9ee9-d46f4e587797", "44c8991d-4df3-4c10-8639-b7b6b8171d60", "49c7cae2-b467-40aa-bd6a-583858c7eb25", "59900f1b-0025-4c03-84d7-dc4bc2dccb9f", "5d31d2df-32cd-4e3f-b76a-0995d34690ab", "631574d8-94a0-4ce5-81af-c39fe0ebd66a", "63f12ac6-639c-404b-8f2a-27bf2d2551cd", "6c849fa6-7d3e-478a-92e9-21c37974ae0f", "8e585b3d-8142-4b67-af55-5f0d11b3bac8", "8e95e372-d389-45d3-9346-424b2e109447", "8f0fe65c-533b-404e-bc67-dac5755f6c23", "8feac316-5028-4c3d-99d7-a6ffa192d5e1", "9dbc6f54-e5b5-40f4-847e-e62ee6b455d8", "9e7cf9c9-9ab6-41c9-bc74-81da1cff6954", "a6c154f8-58b6-4650-b1fe-0a7651abd0dc", "b81805c4-998b-4a02-a47b-3953a8ab932f", "c7682495-eb96-4938-9764-ea0709faf407", "d98cb2a7-0f1e-40ab-b271-8dcff8d2cbc2", "e075bb6a-aad5-49ab-abc2-a8f098b64e1a", "e0b7d9ab-3f3d-418f-9a57-dfa400113515", "e3245a61-4c04-471b-a3f3-06905f23133c", "f14fe544-c75d-4540-971e-7a59b03f0118", "f2acb8aa-f868-403b-b48d-1140b88988e9", "f3165a2f-36e5-4c65-9018-fedb22034e48", "f7a4a2a4-d53f-48dc-9680-e10afb169832", "fef1e75e-95a7-4bd9-a65d-e2364077b9d5", "ff918465-dab0-4927-919f-747291c345ba"], "title": "PRIME\u2014toward process-integrated modeling environments: 1", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology", "year": 1999, "id": "2eceebf6-aa8f-49f4-9c55-c2b690507c61"}
{"abstract": "Segmentation using boundary finding is enhanced both by considering the boundary as a whole and by using model-based shape information. Flexible constraints, in the form of a probabilistic deformable model, are applied to the problem of segmenting natural objects whose diversity and irregularity of shape makes them poorly represented in terms of fixed features of forms. The parametric model is based on the elliptic Fourier decomposition of the boundary. The segmentation problem is solved as an optimization problem, where the best match between the boundary (as defined by the parameter vector) and the image data is found. Initial experimentation shows good results on a variety of images. >", "authors": ["Lawrence H. Staib", "James S.

{"abstract": "Increasing adoption of smartphones in recent times has begun to attract more and more malware writers towards these devices. Among the most prominent and widely adopted open source software stacks for smartphones is Android that comes with a strong security infrastructure for mobile devices. However, as with any remote platform, a service provider or device owner needs assurance that the device is in a trustworthy state before releasing sensitive information to it. Trusted Computing provides a mechanism of establishing such an assurance. Through remote attestation, TC allows a service provider or a device owner to determine whether the device is in a trusted state before releasing protected data to or storing private information on the phone. However, existing remote attestation techniques cannot be deployed on Android due to the unique, VM-based architecture of the software stack. In this paper, we present an attestation mechanism tailored specifically for Android that can measure the integrity of a device at two levels of granularity. Our approach allows a challenger to verify the integrity of Android not only at the operating system level but also that of code executing on top of the VM. We present the implementation details of our architecture and show through evaluation that our architecture is feasible both in terms of time complexity and battery consumption.", "authors": ["Mohammad Nauman", "Sohail Khan", "Xinwen Zhang", "Jean-Pierre Seifert"], "n_citation": 84, "references": ["25baf230-ecc3-4b32-b98f-7c8c061c4802", "302a9db9-1f4c-43d3-901f-29459876ca39", "3184d624-b3b4-4ac3-9230-4f1ac122f3fd", "3f4e537d-8714-4705-b3e3-bdb18fdb06a6", "49853b10-b217-4d19-9a9b-61244ce873ba", "9742c14a-0abf-476b-9d60-c566459cb55f", "a47714e3-37a1-4c3a-8f23-169a7d8b290d", "bdbdd1a2-8ba8-4165-91ef-0c599c6fe959", "daa8323b-417b-47d3-94c6-6aff8e9228fc"], "title": "Beyond kernel-level integrity measurement: enabling remote attestation for the android platform", "venue": "trust and trustworthy computing", "year": 2010, "id": "7cfec886-ae85-4566-8466-e8c3503e8939"}

{"abstract": "Phishing website-based attacks continue to present significant problems for individual and enterprise-level security, including identity theft, malware, and viruses. While the performance of anti-phishing tools has improved considerably, it is unclear how effective such tools are at protecting users. In this study, an experiment involving over 400 participants was used to evaluate the impact of anti-phishing tools' accuracy on users' ability to avoid phishing threats. Each of the participants was given either a high accuracy (90%) or low accuracy (60%) tool and asked to make various decisions about several legitimate and phishing websites. Experiment results revealed that participants using the high accuracy anti-phishing tool significantly outperformed those using the less accurate tool in their ability to: (1) differentiate legitimate websites from phish; (2) avoid visiting phishing websites; and (3) avoid transacting with phishing websites. However, even users of the high accuracy tool often disregarded its correct recommendations, resulting in users' phish detection rates that were approximately 15% lower than those of the anti-phishing tool used. Consequently, on average, participants visited between 74% and 83% of the phishing websites and were willing to transact with as many as 25% of the phishing websites. Anti-phishing tools were also less effective against one particular type of threat. The results suggest that while the accuracy of anti-phishing tools is a critical factor, reducing the success rates of phishing attacks requires other considerations such as improving tool interface/warning design and enhancing users' knowledge of phishing.

This paper reports the integrated findings of five studies that examined a specific cognitive variable,  visualization ability , for different systems (electronic mail, modeling software and operating systems), applying different training methods (analogical or abstract conceptual models) and computer interfaces (command-based or direct manipulation). Consistent with past results in other domains, we found that visualization ability is a strong predictor of user learning success. More importantly, we also found that subjects with lower visualization ability can be helped to narrow, and in some cases equal or surpass, the performance gap between themselves and subjects with higher visualization ability through appropriate training methods and direct manipulation interfaces.

Such languages are better behaved proof theoretically than ordinary modal languages for they internalize the apparatus of labeled deduction.

We then show that adding even one nominal to tense logic raises complexity from pspace to EXPTIME. In the second part we turn to stronger hybrid languages in which it is possible to bind nominals.

We also show that such convergence can be achieved while respecting constraints on voltage magnitude and branch angle differences. The controller is robust under various contingency scenarios, including loss of communication links and failures of DERs.

In principle, CATs are only able to assess one topic for each test. IRT models used in CATs are dichotomous, that is, questions are only scored as correct or incorrect. However, our model can be used to simultaneously assess multiple topics through content-balanced tests. In addition, we have included a polytomous IRT model, where answers can be given partial credit. Therefore, this polytomous model is able to obtain more information from student answers than the dichotomous ones.

{"abstract": "Software startups are more popular than ever and growing in numbers. They operate under conditions of extreme uncertainty and face many challenges. Often, agile development practices and lean principles are suggested as ways to increase the odds of succeeding as a startup, as they both advocate close customer collaboration and short feedback cycles focusing on delivering direct customer value. However, based on an interview study we see that despite guidance and support in terms of well-known and documented development methods, practitioners find it difficult to implement and apply these in practice. To explore this further, and to propose operational support for software startup companies, this study aims at investigating (1) what are the typical challenges when finding a product idea worth scaling, and (2) what solution would serve to address these challenges. To this end, we propose the \u2018Early Stage Software Startup Development Model\u2019 (ESSSDM). The model extends already existing lean principles, but offers novel support for practitioners for investigating multiple product ideas in parallel, for determining when to move forward with a product idea, and for deciding when to abandon a product idea.

{"abstract": "BACKGROUND - Predicting defect-prone software components is an economically important activity and so has received a good deal of attention. However, making sense of the many, and sometimes seemingly inconsistent, results is difficult. OBJECTIVE - We propose and evaluate a general framework for software defect prediction that supports 1) unbiased and 2) comprehensive comparison between competing prediction systems. METHOD - The framework is comprised of 1) scheme evaluation and 2) defect prediction components. The scheme evaluation analyzes the prediction performance of competing learning schemes for given historical data sets. The defect predictor builds models according to the evaluated learning scheme and predicts software defects with new data according to the constructed model. In order to demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework, we use both simulation and publicly available software defect data sets. RESULTS - The results show that we should choose different learning schemes for different data sets (i.e., no scheme dominates), that small details in conducting how evaluations are conducted can completely reverse findings, and last, that our proposed framework is more effective and less prone to bias than previous approaches. CONCLUSIONS - Failure to properly or fully evaluate a learning scheme can be misleading; however, these problems may be overcome by our proposed framework.", "authors": ["Qinbao Song", "Zihan Jia", "Martin J.

{"abstract": "Business processes are conventionally modeled as monolithic flows that capture the desired business logic. However, developing process flows is challenging. Because a flow specifies what its participants should do, it restricts the autonomy of its participants, thus limiting their ability to exploit opportunities or accommodate exceptions according to their business preferences. We take a dual perspective wherein business processes are modeled as compositions of (instantiated) business protocols. Each business protocol specifies interactions among its partners; each protocol serves a unique business purpose, e.g., processing a payment or shipping an item. Thus, modularizing a monolithic business process via business protocols allows clear separation of concerns for modeling and enacting the process. We develop an approach in which protocols are compiled into local skeletal flows for each participant that can be fleshed out with local business logic as needed. Such flows are naturally distributed but can be enacted using commercial business flow engines. Thus, our protocol-based approach combines the benefit of improved modeling with simplified implementations.", "authors": ["Nirmit Desai", "Munindar P.

{"abstract": "Feature modules are the building blocks of programs in software product lines (SPLs). A foundational assumption of feature-based program synthesis is that features are composed in a predefined sequence called a natural order. Recent work on virtual separation of concerns reveals a new model of feature interactions that shows that feature modules can be quantized as compositions of smaller modules called derivatives. We present this model and examine some of its consequences, namely, that (1) a given program can be reconstructed by composing features in any order, and (2) the contents of a feature module (as expressed as a composition of derivatives) is determined automatically by a feature order. We show that different orders allow one to adjust the contents of a feature module to isolate and study the impact of interactions that a feature has with other features. We also show the utility of generalizing safe composition (SC), a basic analysis of SPLs that verifies program type-safety, to demonstrate that every legal composition of derivatives (and thus any composition order of features) produces a type-safe program, which is a much stronger SC property.", "authors": ["Chang Hwan Peter Kim", "Christian K\u00e4stner", "Don S.

{"abstract": "Over the past fifteen years, the software reverse engineering community has produced many software engineering methods, tools, and techniques that have had significant impact in the software industry. After a research area has evolved for 10-20 years, it can easily fade away due to narrow focus, overgrazing, or lack of impact. Trying to assess the impact of various approaches and results in a research area is difficult - but worthwhile. Taking a step back and looking at a research area from new perspectives is probably easier and can be invigorating. The lessons learned from such exercises may result in new research challenges, foster cross-fertilization among research areas, and shape the focus of the research communities. Inspired by several recent studies that assess the field of software engineering as a whole to define research agendas and funding policies, the author discuss several new perspectives on the problem of continuous software evolution that will hopefully inspire the reverse engineering community. The author then advocate that we need to push monitoring of evolving systems to unprecedented levels to be able to observe and possibly orchestrate their continuous evolution in a complex and changing environment. The author then suggest to instrument evolving software-intensive systems with autonomic elements, using reverse engineering techniques, to enhance their monitoring and assessment capabilities", "authors": ["Hausi A.

{"abstract": "We present a method for computing dense visual correspondence based on general assumptions about scene geometry. Our algorithm does not rely on correlation, and uses a variable region of support. We assume that images consist of a number of connected sets of pixels with the same disparity, which we call disparity components. Using maximum likelihood arguments, at each pixel we compute a small set of plausible disparities. A pixel is assigned a disparity d based on connected components of pixels, where each pixel in a component considers d to be plausible.

{"abstract": "Multidatabases offer practical means of managing information sharing from multiple preexisting heterogeneous databases. Furthermore, advances in computation and communication technologies allow users to access computer networks, using portable computing devices via a wireless connection, while mobile. By superimposing the mobile computing environment onto the multidatabase system, a new computing environment is attained. In this work, we concentrate on the effects of the mobile-computing environment on query processing in multidatabases. Within the broadcasting environment, the organization of the data objects along a single air channel should follow the semantic links assumed within the objects' graph. Learning from our past experiences in objects' organization on conventional storage mediums (disks), we propose a scheme for organizing objects along a single sequential broadcast channel.

This result is then combined with known results on the ability of message-passing algorithms to reduce the number of errors to an arbitrarily small fraction for relatively high transmission rates.

{"abstract": "Proposals for the provision of deterministic quality of service guarantees in integrated services networks require per-session management of traffic flowing in network switches, raising scalability questions for practical implementation of high speed packet switching in large scale networks. At the same time, the end-to-end delay bounds associated with current proposals can be overly conservative, limiting the utility of the bounds to guide efficient resource allocation. In this paper, we introduce SCED+ (surface curve earliest deadline+), a network scheduling algorithm that yields scalable provision of tight deterministic end-to-end delay bounds. These features are achieved through the use of aggregation and efficient statistical multiplexing between best-effort and guaranteed traffic. The SCEDS+ algorithm also supports statistical multiplexing between \"guaranteed\" traffic streams, providing tight end-to-end delay bounds for traffic streams which can tolerate non-zero packet loss rates. In order to facilitate the analysis of SCED+, we refine the so-called \"network calculus\" to address delay jitter, and introduce a simple and unified approach to the analysis of output burstiness of traffic departing from a general network element.", "authors": ["Rene L.

We establish conditions under which a feedback interconnected (time-invariant or non-autonomous) system can be regarded as a cascaded time-varying system. The ?technique? finds motivation in numerous particular applications, notably, in output feedback (observer-based) control where two subsystems are feedback interconnected and it results desirable to analyze the system as a cascade. Indeed, cascaded-based design allows for considerably simple controllers that exploit the physical structure of the system and sufficient conditions for stability of cascaded systems are often easier to apply than finding strict Lyapunov functions.

{"abstract": "Methods for triangle mesh decimation are common; however, most existing techniques operate only on static geometry. In this paper, we present a view- and pose-independent method for the automatic simplification of skeletally articulated meshes. Such meshes have associated kinematic skeletons that are used to control their deformation, with the position of each vertex influenced by a linear combination of bone transformations. Our method extends the commonly-used quadric error metric by incorporating knowledge of potential poses into a probability function. We minimize the average error of the deforming mesh over all possible configurations, weighted by the probability. This is possible by transforming the quadrics from each configuration into a common coordinate system. Our simplification algorithm runs as a preprocess, and the resulting meshes can be seamlessly integrated into existing systems. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach for generating highly-simplified models while preserving necessary detail in deforming regions near joints.", "authors": ["Christopher DeCoro", "Szymon Rusinkiewicz"], "n_citation": 58, "references": ["0075805b-ae9a-4e41-883d-61850aaed472", "043eaee3-4d03-475b-97a9-e3c5bdc79f30", "1d42c285-4fd6-4f55-9189-7c04d67b87ff", "2ff76997-6336-417e-af6d-930b679573a7", "3adc3773-72a9-45a4-bbfe-edc832f1a9f1", "535ca876-9e7e-4788-8e6c-8f5ea991cf6e", "539ca67a-6aa6-480d-bc18-ed2ce839e495", "5cc8338c-b8a9-4190-aab7-821b087f6bd1", "6e49e6c4-d9f9-4db0-a15c-76d2d575ae98", "7050f0fb-7af2-49aa-86e1-b4115342ee85", "7cea37f4-5fa3-44b5-a673-c9016ad3f691", "85cb5780-b3d5-4b17-8c17-7886f91db1cc", "9bd56f04-a652-48d6-86af-746a43838430", "ad106012-b65a-4488-afdb-1bfb2a24235c", "b87cce6a-7915-4dcd-b387-d13bf9fd626d"], "title": "Pose-independent simplification of articulated meshes", "venue": "interactive 3d graphics and games", "year": 2005, "id": "8b7bded4-1493-4590-b077-df9396693199"}

Working from a social constructionist perspective, and on the basis of an extensive empirical research process, we are gaining insight into the variables heeded by young people during the earliest stages of technology use, stages we call 'appropriation'. We propose a model that discusses appropriation in terms of the interplay between what young people desire, the capabilities and implications of technology and the situations of use that young people inhabit. Depending on the balance between these factors, we are able to observe three outcomes: non-appropriation, appropriation and disappropriation.

{"abstract": "The multi-tier implementation has become the industry standard for developing scalable client-server enterprise applications. Since these applications are performance sensitive, effective models for dynamic resource provisioning and for delivering quality of service to these applications become critical. Workloads in such environments are characterized by client sessions of interdependent requests with changing transaction mix and load over time, making model adaptivity to the observed workload changes a critical requirement for model effectiveness. In this work, we apply a regression-based approximation of the CPU demand of client transactions on a given hardware. Then we use this approximation in an analytic model of a simple network of queues, each queue representing a tier, and show the approximation's effectiveness for modeling diverse workloads with a changing transaction mix over time. Using the TPC- W benchmark and its three different transaction mixes we investigate factors that impact the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed performance prediction models. Experimental results show that this regression-based approach provides a simple and powerful solution for efficient capacity planning and resource provisioning of multi-tier applications under changing workload conditions.", "authors": ["Qi Zhang", "Ludmila Cherkasova", "Evgenia Smirni"], "n_citation": 212, "references": ["12baaca5-2272-4307-83dc-23f257491def", "57d3b0c3-a068-42dd-9e03-9c990f608ef3", "6b31966f-09d6-4a5a-aa50-4d5bd1f6c034", "76bbc144-3a33-4589-a7bb-53714f60378a", "8276bbbc-02a7-4a6c-aabd-e8506b7c0fe7", "a043fd0e-9acb-4588-bd84-575ba57243ec", "d8659075-39d8-4a5e-89f9-ee527bf3d6c3", "e556d501-f8b0-4499-865a-cc900e7390f8", "e5d333bf-535a-44ef-be6f-6bd9e886e79c", "fc45a01c-5a9d-4d4e-9da7-e0d9e774515b"], "title": "A Regression-Based Analytic Model for Dynamic Resource Provisioning of Multi-Tier Applications", "venue": "international conference on autonomic computing", "year": 2007, "id": "739f6084-0fc6-418c-bfc5-ed7c7416cf87"}

{"abstract": "In most experiments with user interface agents to date, it has been necessary either to implement both the agent and the application from scratch, or to modify the code of an existing application to enable the necessary communication. Instead, we would like to be able to `attach' an agent to an existing application, while requiring only a minimum of advance planning on the part of the application developer. Commercial applications are increasingly supporting the use of `application programmers' interfaces' and scripting languages as means of achieving external control of applications. Are these mechanisms sufficient for software agents to achieve communication with applications? This paper reports some preliminary experiments in developing agent software that works with existing, unmodified commercial applications and agents that work across multiple applications. We describe a programming by example agent,  ScriptAgent , that uses a scripting language, Applescript, to record example procedures that are generalized by the agent. Another approach is examinability, where the application grants to the agent the right to examine internal data structures. We present another kind of learning agent,  Tatlin , that compares successive application states to infer interface operations. Finally, we discuss broader systems issues such as parallelism, interface sharing between agent and application, and access to objects.", "authors": ["Henry Lieberman"], "n_citation": 174, "references": ["2e37a399-5479-44f4-90c3-16417ffc78e4", "3d119cd6-ef03-4588-8091-1eecfdefb945", "4078d3c3-d9c4-410a-831f-14fbe412fff1", "50fd58c0-dadb-40d1-8039-d65cb4866642", "b9ed95de-8f8f-4fd0-979c-0a3591be1b24", "db229d9e-2e77-4110-b439-224b2551c418", "dbc4d6c8-eac3-4e21-849d-98bb4ae833a2"], "title": "Integrating user interface agents with conventional applications", "venue": "Knowledge Based Systems", "year": 1998, "id": "392c5022-b363-4bb2-9cca-2ee8dbcb2354"}

{"abstract": "Researchers have argued that for failure to be observed the following three conditions must be met: 1) the defect is executed, 2) the program has transitioned into an infectious state, and 3) the infection has propagated to the output. Coincidental correctness arises when the program produces the correct output, while conditions 1) and 2) are met but not 3). In previous work, we showed that coincidental correctness is prevalent and demonstrated that it is a safety reducing factor for coverage-based fault localization. This work aims at cleansing test suites from coincidental correctness to enhance fault localization. Specifically, given a test suite in which each test has been classified as failing or passing, we present three variations of a technique that identify the subset of passing tests that are likely to be coincidentally correct. We evaluated the effectiveness of our techniques by empirically quantifying the following: 1) how accurately did they identify the coincidentally correct tests, 2) how much did they improve the effectiveness of coverage-based fault localization, and 3) how much did coverage decrease as a result of applying them. Using our better performing technique and configuration, the safety and precision of fault-localization was improved for 88% and 61% of the programs, respectively.", "authors": ["Wes Masri", "Rawad Abou Assi"], "n_citation": 65, "references": ["0ce49acd-1138-4fcf-9372-6527c2d6d386", "0ed73fc7-0a43-4035-baeb-2ae130c184d5", "14caffec-24d3-4281-91ae-4963045e94f3", "319d6cce-1f87-48aa-a643-e3af7e43ef7b", "3752c733-0f6c-493b-9c70-dc3e5fd0b689", "38ee6d78-2e25-4440-9bc3-657f30b8f93a", "56159371-a48f-4a4c-8db6-9a1ee3ac6cbb", "73eac43b-a988-4326-938c-e3eda7f8e8d5", "8ce6d2da-e4ff-4b1d-abc3-a61e2cbf6ce1", "8d0050dc-fbae-41c9-bc92-2c18a2944d4b", "a7122806-c66c-49e6-8876-70093d70f605", "ba02d0bb-8c05-477c-b14c-2b0158026889", "c7dda81c-0759-4906-9b8c-dc02aafacb05", "cf752ca1-6232-4a5d-8fda-7dd7cb70e405", "ddc4dea3-a9f4-4a19-9e43-d28977f675ac", "dedf1f56-0e5c-4dc4-b0f0-8d822a986471", "eafe671d-f6eb-4a21-be0d-b7e697e04d70", "f3839c60-8518-4523-9e5a-6a4961e2e725", "f3d358db-832e-4657-9541-f3e3cbfbf28e", "fc7cc523-2962-4a42-b4e9-23d687ade0f3"], "title": "Cleansing Test Suites from Coincidental Correctness to Enhance Fault-Localization", "venue": "international conference on software testing, verification, and validation", "year": 2010, "id": "8bf0dd9d-0f49-44c1-a3a9-c1689a245b5d"}

We give a necessary and sufficient condition under which this approximate Pareto curve can be constructed in time polynomial in the size of the instance and 1//spl epsiv/. In the case of multiple linear objectives, we distinguish between two cases: when the underlying feasible region is convex, then we show that approximating the multi-objective problem is equivalent to approximating the single-objective problem. If however the feasible region is discrete, then we point out that the question reduces to an old and recurrent one: how does the complexity of a combinatorial optimization problem change when its feasible region is intersected with a hyperplane with small coefficients; we report some interesting new findings in this domain.

{"abstract": "Signature-based network intrusion-detection systems (NIDSs) often report a massive number of simple alerts of low-level security-related events. Many of these alerts are logically involved in a single multi-stage intrusion incident and a security officer often wants to analyze the complete incident instead of each individual simple alert. This paper proposes a well-structured model that abstracts the logical relation between the alerts in order to support automatic correlation of those alerts involved in the same intrusion. The basic building block of the model is a logical formula called a  capability . We use  capability  to abstract consistently and precisely all levels of accesses obtained by the attacker in each step of a multistage intrusion. We then derive inference rules to define logical relations between different capabilities. Based on the model and the inference rules, we have developed several novel alert correlation algorithms and implemented a prototype alert correlator. The experimental results of the correlator using several intrusion datasets demonstrate that the approach is effective in both alert fusion and alert correlation and has the ability to correlate alerts of complex multistage intrusions. In several instances, the alert correlator successfully correlated more than two thousand Snort alerts involved in massive scanning incidents. It also helped us find two multistage intrusions that were missed in auditing by the security officers.", "authors": ["Jingmin Zhou", "Mark R. Heckman", "Brennen Reynolds", "Adam J.

For noise-free channels, the four adaptive predictors, a least squares lattice, a least mean square lattice, a Kalman transversal form, and a gradient transversal form, all exceed the fixed predictor performance as well as the performance of a continuously variable slope delta (CVSD) modulation system. For bit error rates (BER's) of 10 -3 or greater, the transversal predictor performance falls below that of the fixed predictor and CVSD; however, the lattice structures maintain their performance advantage. The least squares lattice predictor has the best objective and subjective performance for both noiseless and noisy channels. All systems perform poorly for a BER of 10 -2 . To extend the performance of ADPCM with a least squares lattice predictor down to a BER of 10 -2 , the sampling rate is reduced and a selective coding scheme is devised. The resulting ADPCM system maintains excellent performance through a BER of 10 -2 and outperforms CVSD for noise-free and noisy channels. The dynamic range, tandeming performance, and behavior for noisy inputs for the ADPCM system and CVSD are investigated.", "authors": ["Randall C. Reininger", "Jerry D.

{"abstract": "Malicious shellcodes are segments of binary code disguised as normal input data. Such shellcodes can be injected into a target process's virtual memory. They overwrite the process's return addresses and hijack control flow. Detecting and filtering out such shellcodes is vital to prevent damage. In this paper, we propose a new malicious shellcode detection methodology in which we take snapshots of the process's virtual memory before input data are consumed, and feed the snapshots to a malicious shellcode detector. These snapshots are used to instantiate a runtime environment that emulates the target process's input data consumption to monitor shellcodes' behaviors. The snapshots can also be used to examine the system calls that shellcodes invoke, these system call parameters, and the process's execution flow. We implement a prototype system in Debian Linux with kernel version 2.6.26. Our extensive experiments with real traces and thousands of malicious shellcodes illustrate our system's performance with low overhead and few false negatives and few false positives.", "authors": ["Boxuan Gu", "Xiaole Bai", "Zhimin Yang", "Adam C.

{"abstract": "The latest extension of the Etherphone project is described. It creates a powerful conferencing system that lets users control their participation in multiple conferences across multimedia networks. The emphasis is on the software mechanisms that support its new features: first, a Sparcstation facility called Phoenix that extends the Etherphone software architecture to permit more flexible conferencing and to control Sparcstation-based Ethernet audio transmission, and, second, the integration of the Phoenix capabilities with Macaw, the earlier video extensions. Also described is a multicast packet protocol for audio transmission, which reimplements and extends the earlier special-purpose protocols, adding per-channel volume control and full support for the extended conferencing modes. >", "authors": ["H.M.

{"abstract": "Current I/O benchmarks suffer from several chronic problems: they quickly become obsolete, they do not stress the I/O system, and they do not help in understanding I/O system performance. We propose a new approach to I/O performance analysis. First, we propose a self-scaling benchmark that dynamically adjusts aspects of its workload according to the performance characteristic of the system being measured. By doing so, the benchmark automatically scales across current and future systems. The evaluation aids in understanding system performance by reporting how performance varies according to each of fie workload parameters. Second, we propose predicted performance, a technique for using the results from the self-scaling evaluation to quickly estimate the performance for workloads that have not been measured. We show that this technique yields reasonably accurate performance estimates and argue that this method gives a far more accurate comparative performance evaluation than traditional single point benchmarks. We apply our new evaluation technique by measuring a SPARCstation 1+ with one SCSI disk, an HP 730 with one SCSI-II disk, a Sprite LFS DECstation 5000/200 with a three-disk disk array, a Convex C240 minisupercomputer with a four-disk disk array, and a Solbourne 5E/905 fileserver with a two-disk disk array.", "authors": ["Peter M.

{"abstract": "Vivaldi is a distributed algorithm that assigns synthetic coordinates to internet hosts, so that the Euclidean distance between two hosts' coordinates predicts the network latency between them. Each node in Vivaldi computes its coordinates by simulating its position in a network of physical springs. Vivaldi is both distributed and efficient: no fixed infrastructure need be deployed and a new host can compute useful coordinates after collecting latency information from only a few other hosts. Vivaldi can rely on piggy-backing latency information on application traffic instead of generating extra traffic by sending its own probe packets.This paper evaluates Vivaldi through simulations of 750 hosts, with a matrix of inter-host latencies derived from measurements between 750 real Internet hosts. Vivaldi finds synthetic coordinates that predict the measured latencies with a median relative error of 14 percent. The simulations show that a new host joining an existing Vivaldi system requires fewer than 10 probes to achieve this accuracy. Vivaldi is currently used by the Chord distributed hash table to perform proximity routing, replica selection, and retransmission timer estimation.", "authors": ["Russ Cox", "Frank Dabek", "M.

{"abstract": "This paper discusses a meta model for representing various software specification & design methods, and a supporting tool for development of specifications by using the multiple methods. This tool is called method base, which has various catalogued methods so that a software designer can select an adequate method for his problem domain by consulting with it. The designer will be navigated throughout his design process, according to the selected method. Subsequently, a method base system can hold the information about the produced documents and about the activities performed in the specification process. It is an essential point how to integrate sub specifications developed by the multiple methods into a final specification. The information about the semantical relationships among the methods is needed. It can be represented by the meta model because it is constructed from the atomic concepts common to the methods, such as object, association, event, state, data, and process. The meta model and the formal representations of the methods can be described in Entity Relationship Diagram. The representations of Object Oriented Analysis (OOA) and Structured Analysis (SA) are presented as the examples.

{"abstract": "Timed automata are among the most widely studied models for real-time systems. Silent transitions, i.e., e-transitions, have already been proposed in the original paper on timed automata by Alur and Dill [3]. We show that the class TL e of timed languages recognized by automata with e-transitions, is more robust and more expressive than the corresponding class TL without e-transitions. We then focus on e-transitions without reset, i.e. e-transitions which do not reset clocks. We propose an algorithm to construct, given a timed automaton, an equivalent one without such transitions. This algorithm is in two steps, it first suppresses the cycles of e-transitions without reset and then the remaining ones. Then, we prove that a timed automaton such that no e-transition which resets clocks lies on any directed cycle, can be effectively transformed into a timed automaton without etransitions. Interestingly, this main result holds under the assumption of non-Zenoness and it is false otherwise. To complete the picture, we exhibit a simple timed automaton with an e-transition, which resets some clock, on a cycle and which is not equivalent to any e-free timed automaton. To show this, we develop a promising new technique based on the notion of precise action.

{"abstract": "This paper considers a cloud computing setting in which similarity querying of metric data is outsourced to a service provider. The data is to be revealed only to trusted users, not to the service provider or anyone else. Users query the server for the most similar data objects to a query example. Outsourcing offers the data owner scalability and a low-initial investment. The need for privacy may be due to the data being sensitive (e.g., in medicine), valuable (e.g., in astronomy), or otherwise confidential. Given this setting, the paper presents techniques that transform the data prior to supplying it to the service provider for similarity queries on the transformed data. Our techniques provide interesting trade-offs between query cost and accuracy. They are then further extended to offer an intuitive privacy guarantee. Empirical studies with real data demonstrate that the techniques are capable of offering privacy while enabling efficient and accurate processing of similarity queries.", "authors": ["Man Lung Yiu", "Ira Assent", "Christian S.

{"abstract": "We present the design and implementation of an aircraft collision avoidance algorithm for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) is used to detect aircraft. The UAV needs to fly through pre-assigned waypoints while avoiding collisions with other aircraft. The aircraft are indifferent to the UAV. A collision with aircraft are detected by simulating the UAV's trajectory along the path of assigned waypoints using its closed-loop dynamics. A sampling based algorithm is used for collision avoidance path planning. A second collision check is performed on the generated path with the updated UAV and aircraft's states. The path will be re-planned if it leads to a collision. The algorithm was validated in Software-In-the-Loop Simulation (SITL). ADS-B data obtained from commercial aircraft flying over the Phoenix Skyharbor airport were used for simulating the collisions.

{"abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are characterized by the dense deployment of sensor nodes that continuously observe physical phenomenon. Due to high density in the network topology, sensor observations are highly correlated in the space domain. Furthermore, the nature of the physical phenomenon constitutes the temporal correlation between each consecutive observation of a sensor node. These spatial and temporal correlations along with the collaborative nature of the WSN bring significant potential advantages for the development of efficient communication protocols well-suited for the WSN paradigm. In this paper, several key elements are investigated to capture and exploit the correlation in the WSN for the realization of advanced efficient communication protocols. A theoretical framework is developed to model the spatial and temporal correlations in WSN. The objective of this framework is to enable the development of efficient communication protocols which exploit these advantageous intrinsic features of the WSN paradigm.

{"abstract": "The uncertainty of a software development effort estimate can be indicated through a prediction interval (PI), i.e., the estimated minimum and maximum effort corresponding to a specific confidence level. For example, a project manager may be ''90% confident'' or believe that is it ''very likely'' that the effort required to complete a project will be between 8000 and 12,000 work-hours. This paper describes results from four studies (Studies A-D) on human judgement (expert) based PIs of software development effort. Study A examines the accuracy of the PIs in real software projects. The results suggest that the PIs were generally much too narrow to reflect the chosen level of confidence, i.e., that there was a strong over-confidence. Studies B-D try to understand the reasons for the observed over-confidence. Study B examines the possibility that the over-confidence is related to type of experience or estimation process. Study C examines the possibility that the concept of confidence level is difficult to interpret for software estimators. Finally, Study D examines the possibility that there are unfortunate feedback mechanisms that reward over-confidence.", "authors": ["Magne J\u00f8rgensen", "Karl Halvor Teigen", "Kjetil Mol\u00f8kken"], "n_citation": 123, "references": ["13a9976a-a9b5-493b-9cf3-ee67f976fd6b", "1b6ec550-609f-43cb-a61f-d9acad56ac66", "9bfa77ad-8cce-4579-8c8b-8aa0160de5af", "d712970f-941b-4809-85f9-ae41fd710589", "e1267049-e158-4448-abe8-b51262344281", "ecbbe8a4-2ee1-4942-9b0f-fd8988fe6036", "f47a8109-3d17-4b88-833f-d36c9e9c3c3d"], "title": "Better sure than safe?

{"abstract": "Formal hardware verification based on symbolic trajectory evaluation shows considerable promise in verifying medium to large scale VLSI designs with a high degree of automation. However, in order to verify today's designs, a method for composing partial verification results is needed. This paper presents a theory of composition for symbolic trajectory evaluation and shows how implementing this theory using a specialized theorem prover is very attractive. Symbolic trajectory evaluation is used to prove low level properties of a circuit, and these properties are combined using the prover. Providing a powerful and flexible interface to a coherent system (with automatic assistance in parts) reduces the load on the human verifier. This hybrid approach, coupled with powerful and simple data representation, increases the range of circuits which can be verified using trajectory evaluation. The paper concludes with two examples. One example is the complete verification of a 64 b multiplier which takes approximately 15 minutes on a SPARC 10 machine. >", "authors": ["Scott Hazelhurst", "Carl-Johan H.

{"abstract": "Schema-based representations for visual knowledge are integrated with constraint satisfaction techniques. This integration is discussed in a progression of three sketch map interpretation programs: Mapsee-1, Mapsee-2, and Mapsee-3. The programs are evaluated by the criteria of descriptive and procedural adequacy. The evaluation indicates that a schema-based representation used in combination with a hierarchical arc-consistency algorithm constitutes a modular, efficient, and effective approach to the structured representation of visual knowledge. The schemata used in this representation are embedded in composition and specialization hierarchies. Specialization hierarchies are further expanded into discrimination graphs. >", "authors": ["Jan A. Mulder", "Alan K. Mackworth", "William S.

{"abstract": "Despite a lot of research efforts in sports video analysis, soccer video indexing remains a challenging task due to the lack of structure in a soccer game that could help in structure analysis. In particular, little work was done in detecting and tracking the ball whose trajectory could play a crucial role for detecting key events. We propose a novel framework for accurately detecting the ball for broadcast soccer video. Our framework combines both direct and indirect insights to identify the ball rather than conventional simple template matching methods. It has three key components. First we infer the ball size range from the player size. Next non-ball objects are removed to reduce the possible ball candidates. Last but not least, a Kalman filer-based procedure mines candidate trajectories in candidate feature images. Then, a procedure selects the reliable ball trajectories from them. The experimental results on two 1000-frame sequences confirm that the proposed framework is very effective and obtain a better result than existing methods.", "authors": ["Xinguo Yu", "Qi Tian", "Kong Wah Wan"], "n_citation": 63, "references": ["0bb47f64-0684-4969-9c61-6a0e38d4bcb5", "146f39ed-baa2-483e-a17f-f396a532b208", "2d5b2fd4-e3e9-4c1c-8b23-99764f7f78b5", "640cde40-b1e3-40c2-b87d-9554be1a0061", "8d9f7d89-9182-4d7b-bb9e-2d3ee2228a09", "b6cf135c-9fd0-4329-b6ab-bf1566e49da5"], "title": "A novel ball detection framework for real soccer video", "venue": "international conference on multimedia and expo", "year": 2003, "id": "995d3b5e-b009-4b9a-ad80-1810bbbfd407"}

{"abstract": "Reuse through application generators has been successful in the area of programming language systems. We analyzed three language system projects that realized transition from the initial ad hoc programs, through libraries of reusable modules to application generator solutions. We tried to understand the underlying thinking process and technical factors that made such a transition possible. Based on this study, we generalized reuse  experiences gained in the language system domain and formulated a reuse implementation framework. Our framework is to facilitate transition from component-based reuse to application generators in other domains. Ultimately, we hope our framework will offer reuse implementation guidelines for companies to realize such a transition.

{"abstract": "The multiplication of a vector by a matrix is the kernel operation in many algorithms used in scientific computation. A fast and efficient parallel algorithm for this calculation is therefore desirable. This paper describes a parallel matrix-vector multiplication algorithm which is particularly well suited to dense matrices or matrices with an irregular sparsity pattern. Such matrices can arise from discretizing partial differential equations on irregular grids or from problems exhibiting nearly random connectivity between data structures. The communication cost of the algorithm is independent of the matrix sparsity pattern and is shown to scale as for an n\u00d7n matrix on p processors. The algorithm\u2019s performance is demonstrated by using it within the well known NAS conjugate gradient benchmark. This resulted in the fastest run times achieved to date on both the 1024 node nCUBE 2 and the 128 node Intel iPSC/860. Additional improvements to the algorithm which are possible when integrating it with the conjugate gradient algorithm are also discussed.", "authors": ["Bruce Hendrickson", "Robert W.

Higher-order rewrite systems are defined to be rewrite systems over lambda -terms whose left-hand sides are patterns: this guarantees that the rewrite relation is easily computable. The notion of critical pair is generalized to higher-order rewrite systems, and the analog of the critical pair lemma is proved. The restricted nature of patterns is instrumental in obtaining these results. The critical pair lemma is applied to a number of lambda -calculi and some first-order logic formalized by higher-order rewrite systems. >", "authors": ["Tobias Nipkow"], "n_citation": 360, "references": ["148f3867-bc7d-4b33-86de-7051d7cdfab8", "1e459f12-9ffa-43aa-8dcf-f22a6b8d2d5a", "3fca2601-6e10-463d-9741-87d3c18718e6"], "title": "Higher-order critical pairs", "venue": "logic in computer science", "year": 1991, "id": "0bae3849-767e-416c-b90f-e54f989df8c4"}

{"abstract": "A spoken language generation system has been developed that learns to describe objects in computer-generated visual scenes. The system is trained by a \u2018show-and-tell\" procedure in which visual scenes are paired with natural language descriptions. Learning algorithms acquire probabilistic structures which encode the visual semantics of phrase structure, word classes, and individual words. Using these structures, a planning algorithm integrates syntactic, semantic, and contextual constraints to generate natural and unambiguous descriptions of objects in novel scenes. The system generates syntactically well-formed compound adjective noun phrases, as well as relative spatial clauses. The acquired linguistic structures generalize from training data, enabling the production of novel word sequences which were never observed during training. The output of the generation system is synthesized using word-based concatenative synthesis drawing from the original training speech corpus. In evaluations of semantic comprehension by human judges, the performance of automatically generated spoken descriptions was comparable to human-generated descriptions. This work is motivated by our long-term goal of developing spoken language processing systems which grounds semantics in machine perception and action. ! 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It starts with a nominal control law formulated for non-delayed case and simply inverts the sign of the control gains for some surprising benefits when used with the delays.

However, SIC with large delays may yield some complementary benefits to the nominal control logic from delay robustness perspective. The main question we address in this paper is \u2018How to select the nominal control law so that such a contribution can be (a) feasible, (b) optimal in some sense?\u2019 A structured methodology is proposed to achieve this, starting with a linear quadratic regulator based controller.

{"abstract": "In a landmark paper, Papadimitriou and Roughgarden described a polynomial-time algorithm (\u201cEllipsoid Against Hope\u201d) for computing sample correlated equilibria of concisely-represented games. Recently, Stein, Parrilo and Ozdaglar showed that this algorithm can fail to find an exact correlated equilibrium. We present a variant of the Ellipsoid Against Hope algorithm that guarantees the polynomial-time identification of exact correlated equilibrium. Our algorithm differs from the original primarily in its use of a separation oracle that produces cuts corresponding to pure-strategy profiles. Our new separation oracle can be understood as a derandomization of Papadimitriou and Roughgarden's original separation oracle via the method of conditional probabilities. We also adapt our techniques to two related algorithms that are based on the Ellipsoid Against Hope approach, Hart and Mansour's communication procedure for correlated equilibria and Huang and von Stengel's algorithm for extensive-form correlated equilibria, in both cases yielding efficient exact solutions.", "authors": ["Albert Xin Jiang", "Kevin Leyton-Brown"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["2f7113a3-d226-4bae-a717-e5a818835d69", "413a51e0-de05-45ab-8978-8fc453f6af3e", "4b5b5f04-caa2-4a2b-99df-1cbaec9e0803", "4df42c16-ddae-4085-9835-6cca447e0314", "567e5821-1dfb-49ff-8480-a2679fe5e421", "6386ff88-2409-4dc9-930c-5f03484dc75d", "6f273a26-dec7-4e50-87b1-8bc0bf6b45eb", "767cadd7-c155-4e90-b575-0fca56a862f2", "8be76e61-6384-44eb-8c2b-7f27fac44bc1", "a898412e-847f-44d1-979e-da85e2eda56a", "b6ffd006-b646-4926-8352-7d4b2953d1ab", "d7655aaa-98b7-48a7-9def-ac4c8dd3ab5a"], "title": "Polynomial-time computation of exact correlated equilibrium in compact games", "venue": "Games and Economic Behavior", "year": 2015, "id": "e313bbcb-3964-4a78-bb00-ccec4215842e"}

{"abstract": "This paper investigates whether torso force feedback on treadmillstyle locomotion interfaces can substitute for treadmill tilt to simulate walking on smooth inclines. The experimental platform is the Sarcos Treadport, whose active mechanical tether can apply horizontal forces to the user to simulate the gravity forces experienced in slope walking. The authors show that users are extremely sensitive to slope while walking, being able to discriminate a 0.5 degree slope change. Comparisons are then made between walking on a tilted treadmill platform versus walking on a level platform but with tether force application. Psychophysical experiments show that users select tether forces that are predicted by the gravity forces, although at a 65% fractional force level. These results demonstrate definitively that torso force feedback can realistically simulate gravity forces during smooth slope walking.", "authors": ["John M.

{"abstract": "Misuse or loss of web application data can have catastrophic consequences in today's Internet oriented world. Hence, verification of web application data models is of paramount importance. We have developed a framework for verification of web application data models via translation to First Order Logic (FOL), followed by automated theorem proving. Due to the undecidability of FOL, this automated approach does not always produce a conclusive answer. In this paper, we investigate the use of many-sorted logic in data model verification in order to improve the effectiveness of this approach. Many-sorted logic allows us to specify type information explicitly, thus lightening the burden of reasoning about type information during theorem proving. Our experiments demonstrate that using many-sorted logic improves the verification performance significantly, and completely eliminates inconclusive results in all cases over 7 real world web applications, down from an 17% inconclusive rate.", "authors": ["Ivan Boci\u0107", "Tevfik Bultan"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["009e2b50-2192-48ea-b985-29541332e348", "0278bce3-e509-4ae6-b130-87a283a4b819", "0409af3b-a400-455a-826e-34d0456a20ac", "3c421705-59b9-4c0b-916a-0c90c06c8340", "465d8cc9-9bcb-4f4e-bea2-368ecade9810", "64ea8365-bf67-4497-82b6-77d66ccc4c73", "744293b8-70dd-48f9-bcb6-896cc2ad5406", "7443880e-44da-42d7-abff-e4fad6f681d9", "771ab3e5-cd5b-4205-9fed-a9a1f7310143", "7f4bb55f-2aa7-402e-a955-9e190dee2793", "8f6569a7-c2ff-4b94-9169-083863218203", "b69de885-6cff-4b16-8863-8ab099e65856", "b86dfda4-6063-4ef0-81d4-0b0b80dd0de6", "bbe45468-c69c-4794-a54f-856d31e96ca1", "da48ef12-fd92-4e0f-83ec-419102e5ffd9", "dff439c7-31a1-4b04-be16-fa28fc1b8075", "e273b00b-accd-4124-81dd-e64f42b684ce", "f58109b6-ce2a-4a03-b1b1-30a4079b34cc"], "title": "Efficient Data Model Verification with Many-Sorted Logic (T)", "venue": "automated software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "e4f7d00b-aae8-4ecd-aba7-a51c88611c2c"}
{"abstract": "Requirements analysis (RA) involves end users and systems analysts interacting in an effort to recognize and specify the data and information needed to develop an information system. In the design of expert systems, a similar process of eliciting information, in this case human knowledge, has been studied under the banner of knowledge acquisition (KA). When examined closely, many entities and processes involved in RA and KA are almost identical. However, researchers in each area are seemingly unaware of the developments in the other area. In order to facilitate a merged awareness of both research streams, this article compares representative RA and KA techniques, which are grouped, according to elicitation mode, on three dimensions: communication obstacles, a technique's focus of control, and the nature of the understanding gained from using the technique. This comparison demonstrates that these two research streams have many things in common and that researchers in one area can benefit from developments in the other area. Additionally, this analysis leads to several suggested research areas: (1) rigorous examinations of these techniques as they are used to overcome communication obstacles and to enrich understanding; (2) investigations into the seeming match between certain elicitation types and problem domain categories; (3) examinations into synergetic effects of elicitation techniques; (4) development of more techniques for eliciting information requirements to serve emerging needs; and (5) comparisons of the relative advantage of generalized versus specialized elicitation techniques.", "authors": ["Terry Anthony Byrd", "Kathy L.

{"abstract": "SATPLAN is currently one of the fastest planning systems for domain-independent planning. In nearly all practical applications, however, there exists an abundance of domain-specific knowledge that can be used to improve the performance of a planning system. This knowledge is traditionally encoded as procedures or rules that are tied to the details of the planning engine. We present a way to encode domain knowledge in a purely declarative, algorithm independent manner. We demonstrate that the same heuristic knowledge can be used by completely different search engines, one systematic, the other using greedy local search.

Such an integrated model allows usability decisions to be made about abstract system models to complement the more traditional approach of usability evaluation by user testing.In particular, we address the question of what knowledge the user requires in order to successfully achieve a given task and the role the display plays in supplying and maintaining that knowledge. We illustrate our approach using a modelled web browser.We present two abstract models of the display and discuss how these differing designs affect user knowledge and therefore behaviour. We expose an apparently paradoxical result: that improving the user knowledge about the device may lead to more error-prone behaviour.

{"abstract": "In this paper we present a generic late-join service for distributed interactive media, i.e, networked media which involve user interactions. Examples for distributed interactive media are shared whiteboards, networked computer games and distributed virtual environments. The generic late-join service allows a latecomer to join an ongoing session. This requires that the shared state of the medium is transmitted from the old participants of the session to the latecomer in an efficient and scalable way. In order to be generic and useful for a broad range of distributed interactive media, we have implemented the late-join service based on the Real Time Application Level Protocol for Distributed Interactive Media (RTP/I). All applications which employ this protocol can also use the generic late-join service.

{"abstract": "Orthogonal arrays (OAs) are basic combinatorial structures, which appear under various disguises in cryptology and the theory of algorithms. Among their applications are universal hashing, authentication codes, resilient and correlation-immune functions, derandomization of algorithms, and perfect local randomizers. In this paper, we give new explicit bounds on the size of orthogonal arrays using Delsarte's linear programming method. Specifically, we prove that the minimum number of rows in a binary orthogonal array of length $n$ and strength $t$ is at least $ 2^{n} - (n 2^{n-1}/t+1)$ and also at least $ 2^{n} - (2^{n-2}(n+1)/\\lceil \\frac{t+1}{2} \\rceil).$ We also prove that these bounds are as powerful as the linear programming bound itself for many parametric situations. An $(n,m,t)$-resilient function is a function $f: \\{0,1\\}^{n} \\longrightarrow \\{0,1\\}^{m}$ such that every possible output $m$-tuple is equally likely to occur when the values of $t$ arbitrary inputs are fixed by an opponent and the remaining $n-t$ input bits are chosen independently at random. A basic problem is to maximize $t$ given $m$ and $n$, i.e., to determine the largest value of $t$ such that an $(n,m,t)$-resilient function exists. In this paper, we obtain upper and lower bounds for the optimal values of $t$ where $1 \\leq n \\leq 25$ and $1 \\leq m < n$. The upper bounds are derived from Delsarte's linear programming bound, and the lower bounds come from constructions based on error-correcting codes. We also obtain new explicit upper bounds for the optimal values of $t$. #R##N#It was proved by Chor et al. in [{\\em Proc. {\\rm 26}th IEEE Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science}, 1985, pp. 396--407] that an $(n,2,t)$-resilient function exists if and only if $ t < \\lfloor \\frac{2n}{3} \\rfloor$. This result was generalized by Friedman [{\\em Proc. $33$rd IEEE Symp. on Foundations of Computer Science}, 1992, pp. 314--319], who proved a bound for general $m$.

{"abstract": "JavaScript is used by web developers to enhance the interactivity of their sites, offload work to the users' browsers and improve their sites' responsiveness and user-friendliness, making web pages feel and behave like traditional desktop applications. An important feature of JavaScript, is the ability to combine multiple libraries from local and remote sources into the same page, under the same namespace. While this enables the creation of more advanced web applications, it also allows for a malicious JavaScript provider to steal data from other scripts and from the page itself. Today, when developers include remote JavaScript libraries, they trust that the remote providers will not abuse the power bestowed upon them.   In this paper, we report on a large-scale crawl of more than three million pages of the top 10,000 Alexa sites, and identify the trust relationships of these sites with their library providers. We show the evolution of JavaScript inclusions over time and develop a set of metrics in order to assess the maintenance-quality of each JavaScript provider, showing that in some cases, top Internet sites trust remote providers that could be successfully compromised by determined attackers and subsequently serve malicious JavaScript. In this process, we identify four, previously unknown, types of vulnerabilities that attackers could use to attack popular web sites. Lastly, we review some proposed ways of protecting a web application from malicious remote scripts and show that some of them may not be as effective as previously thought.", "authors": ["Nick Nikiforakis", "Luca Invernizzi", "Alexandros Kapravelos", "Steven Van Acker", "Wouter Joosen", "Christopher Kruegel", "Frank Piessens", "Giovanni Vigna"], "n_citation": 159, "references": ["1648eca5-8c1a-4f8a-bf56-6ac5ab026e61", "3da160a2-fbbb-44a6-a594-b4f6f938e4be", "4647bb7d-534c-4250-8c5b-c5d359fc7394", "5571fdeb-f927-4a66-931e-4ab81be71757", "56e7dfba-77b7-411e-856f-a59e41a11c10", "5d696fd4-533f-4b35-9352-f8e0d23fca6b", "6800bbf4-21a8-4867-bdc6-2658084af340", "6bdaf04c-0545-41a8-bae0-b084aefad863", "6be6141c-2f87-4bfe-91e0-c25eac475a8d", "717d675a-0595-4c1f-ba3c-ff4f010aca09", "a45c48cd-3392-44c8-8a01-352884668116", "d5112592-7ae0-4fc6-9433-ec778c8029d0", "d8491254-0621-4dab-b5d1-9fbdd8a92f3e", "e7fdf760-4d69-4579-b7ae-b2c328c7e186", "e92093a1-f96d-446b-8601-38564afe23f0", "e96d8a15-079d-4004-875d-0ee63991ee61", "ec53ed3f-0186-45b9-a6a0-94d607b2e318", "ffbb3160-00f7-4b5a-ad4e-d1f90ac26400"], "title": "You are what you include: large-scale evaluation of remote javascript inclusions", "venue": "computer and communications security", "year": 2012, "id": "1453428e-59a9-49bc-a561-60e9c8ed50bd"}
{"abstract": "We consider a schedule optimization problem where each activity to be scheduled has a duration-dependent quality profile, and activity durations must be determined that maximize overall quality within given deadline and resource constraints. To solve this quality maximization problem, prior work has proposed a hybrid search scheme, where a linear programming solver for optimally setting the durations of temporally related activities is embedded within a larger search procedure that incrementally posts sequencing constraints to resolve resource conflicts. Under this approach, dual concerns of establishing feasibility and optimizing quality are addressed in an integrated fashion. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach, where feasibility and optimization concerns are treated separately: first, we establish a resource-feasible partial order schedule, assuming minimum durations for all activities; second, these fixed duration constraints are relaxed and quality optimal durations are determined, Experimental results indicate a tradeoff: when resource capacity constraints are loose, the integrated hybrid approach performs comparably to the separated scheme. However, in problems with tighter capacity constraints we find that separation of concerns enables both better solving capability and higher quality results. Following from these results, we discuss potential synergy between problem objectives of maintaining temporal flexibility and maximizing quality.", "authors": ["Nicola Policella", "Xiaofang Wang", "Stephen F.

To incorporate spatial information, two modalities of horizontal and vertical partitions are adopted to partition all resolution images into sub-regions with different scales. Each sub-region is then represented as a histogram of codeword occurrences by mapping the local features to the codebook. The proposed approach is evaluated over five commonly used data sets including indoor scenes, outdoor scenes, and sports events.

{"abstract": "The design and development of Internet applications requiring dynamic and possibly mobile access to Internet resources can take advantage of an approach based on autonomous mobile agents. However, mobility introduces peculiar issues related to the modeling and management of the agents' coordination activities. This paper introduces context-dependent coordination as a framework for the design and development of Internet applications based on mobile agents, and shows how it can be supported by a proper coordination infrastructure. Context-dependent coordination is centered on the notion of programmable coordination media, as the software abstraction via which an agent in an Internet site can access to local resources and coordinate with local agents. Programmability stems from the fact that the behavior of the media can be fully configured to influence agents' coordination activities. This enables local administrators to configure coordination media so as to enact site-dependent coordination policies, and mobile agents to configure the accessed coordination media to obtain an application-dependent behavior of the media themselves. Several application examples shows that exploiting context-dependent coordination promotes a clear separation of concerns in design and development, and can make applications more modular and easier to be maintained. The MARS system is assumed as an exemplar coordination infrastructure to clarify the concepts expressed and to show their actual implementation.", "authors": ["Giacomo Cabri", "Letizia Leonardi", "Franco Zambonelli"], "n_citation": 121, "references": ["00496587-8340-45cb-8d22-7a40c46283a9", "136c0a67-95b7-4c41-abd4-152c67e9a3a0", "1a70170c-e012-4ac5-a774-0247fe3f4b5b", "1af91e37-f4a6-4933-b905-274e723d72d5", "24829bb4-274a-447b-b7a6-71695fb2e28d", "26d33515-54b7-4ae1-b833-1454308fd69d", "2b7c69f7-54ce-4a5c-825f-1cb4fd1ea531", "353bc85e-7494-4af1-baa8-a3133451dec2", "35a31e26-c9bc-44a7-9e10-c71584d8acda", "3a32d085-0fa6-4867-8c36-d89465a8b507", "3e9e6308-3535-4a76-b129-8d7cdc4390f4", "48b82857-8287-484a-95a4-d5129cf2f550", "6868d12b-26b6-4611-a4af-9763c684d598", "7820a48c-c87a-44f5-91e6-58b42f19df03", "78d92496-ad88-4e10-8783-5da7a10e1d92", "a12681f7-d410-4d53-8330-356f922376c3", "b6d7b91d-4be0-43a1-8d34-55ef817607cd", "b75c31b4-53d4-4f73-a4ea-734e7ee023e3", "b91c3cab-6dcc-4c01-b0c7-3fcca28eb72c", "bae16d2e-9cfc-421e-95cc-8139f9bc70e6", "bd5ba11b-272b-44ad-9ae1-afa690d3dcb7", "bfd7e012-b018-47e6-ba7c-11ba7d74f2f7", "c72d3bde-7cca-46a2-8d0b-66bc5e1d23c7", "cb23ad2a-8961-4f37-85de-5e242effac8c", "d96f6d0a-609b-4763-852d-50d9f785d8ab", "d9c7cc6d-0067-4dae-848b-fcbe35b4aec9", "daa2f48b-3174-4007-bfe6-d848ca92fd53", "ed0341b0-66f2-4c68-a2bc-e2fa5acd828b", "eff9fe62-1480-483c-9521-79b5da03c47f", "f8f4c057-4c5d-4330-864e-cdd4e4d4451c", "fc059222-1246-459a-8095-ba01fee89ded", "fdff08bb-6c49-4f1f-8c35-ad20806973b9"], "title": "Engineering mobile agent applications via context-dependent coordination", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "year": 2002, "id": "f027df7f-6eb7-49e4-81c9-2d22b24b466c"}

The algorithm converts the original problem, possibly a partially singular one, into a totally nonsingular optimal control problem by introducing a perturbed energy term in the performance index.

{"abstract": "Software systems are known to suffer from outages due to transient errors. Recently, the phenomenon of \"software aging\", in which the state of the software system degrades with time, has been reported (S. Garg et al., 1998). The primary causes of this degradation are the exhaustion of operating system resources, data corruption and numerical error accumulation. This may eventually lead to performance degradation of the software or crash/hang failure, or both. Earlier work in this area to detect aging and to estimate its effect on system resources did not take into account the system workload. In this paper, we propose a measurement-based model to estimate the rate of exhaustion of operating system resources both as a function of time and the system workload state. A semi-Markov reward model is constructed based on workload and resource usage data collected from the UNIX operating system. We first identify different workload states using statistical cluster analysis and build a state-space model. Corresponding to each resource, a reward function is then defined for the model based on the rate of resource exhaustion in the different states. The model is then solved to obtain trends and the estimated exhaustion rates and the time-to-exhaustion for the resources.

{"abstract": "As users and companies increasingly depend on shared, networked information services, we continue to see growth in data centers and service providers. This happens as services and servers are consolidated (for ease of management and reduced duplication), while also being distributed (for fault tolerance and to accommodate the global reach of customers). Since access to data is the lifeblood of any organization, a global storage system is a core element in such an infrastructure. Based on success in automatically managing local storage, we believe that the key attribute of such a system is the ability to flexibly adapt to a variety of application semantics and requirements as they arise and as they change over time. Our work has shown that it is possible to automatically design and configure a storage system of one or more disk arrays to meet a set of application requirements and to dynamically reconfigure as needs change, all without human intervention.

{"abstract": "Domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) are the essence of MDE. A DSML describes the concepts of a particular domain in a metamodel, as well as their relationships. Using a DSML, it is possible to describe a wide range of different models that often share a common base and vary on some parts. On the one hand, some current approaches tend to distinguish the variability language from the DSMLs themselves, implying greater learning curve for DSMLs stakeholders and a significant overhead in product line engineering. On the other hand, approaches integrating variability in DSMLs lack generality and tool support. We argue that aspect-oriented modeling techniques enabling flexible metamodel composition and results obtained by the software product line community to manage and resolve variability form the pillars for a solution for integrating variability into DSMLs. In this article, we consider variability as an independent and generic aspect to be woven into the DSML. In particular, we detail how variability is woven and how to perform product line derivation. We validate our approach through the weaving of variability into two different metamodels: Ecore--widely used for DSML definition--and SmartAdapters, our aspect model weaver.

Furthermore, simple linear regression applied to test scores, class standing, and retention data showed that the test scores and class standing explain 52.6% of the variance in freshmen retention rate and 62.5% of the variance in graduation rate (test scores alone explain 50.5% and 62.0% respectively).

{"abstract": "Performance and power are two primary design issues for systems ranging from server computers to handhelds. Performance is affected by both temperature and supply voltage because of the temperature and voltage dependence of circuit delay. Furthermore, as semiconductor technology scales down, leakage power's exponential dependence on temperature and supply voltage becomes significant. Therefore, future design studies call for temperature and voltage aware performance and power modeling. In this paper, we study microarchitecture-level temperature and voltage aware performance and power modeling. We present a leakage power model with temperature and voltage scaling, and show that leakage and total energy vary by 38% and 24%, respectively, between 65/spl deg/C and 110/spl deg/C. We study thermal runaway induced by the interdependence between temperature and leakage power, and demonstrate that without temperature-aware modeling, underestimation of leakage power may lead to the failure of thermal controls, and overestimation of leakage power may result in excessive performance penalties of up to 5.24%. All of these studies underscore the necessity of temperature-aware power modeling. Furthermore, we study optimal voltage scaling for best performance with dynamic power and thermal management under different packaging options. We show that dynamic power and thermal management allows designs to target at the common-case thermal scenario among benchmarks and improves performance by 6.59% compared to designs targeted at the worst case thermal scenario without dynamic power and thermal management. Additionally, the optimal V/sub dd/ for the best performance may not be the largest V/sub dd/ allowed by the given packaging platform, and that advanced cooling techniques can improve throughput significantly.", "authors": ["Wei-Ping Liao", "Lei He", "Kevin M.

{"abstract": "Electrical power management in large-scale IT systems such as commercial data-centers is an application area of rapidly growing interest from both an economic and ecological perspective, with billions of dollars and millions of metric tons of CO2 emissions at stake annually. Businesses want to save power without sacrificing performance. This paper presents a reinforcement learning approach to simultaneous online management of both performance and power consumption. We apply RL in a realistic laboratory testbed using a Blade cluster and dynamically varying HTTP workload running on a commercial web applications middleware platform. We embed a CPU frequency controller in the Blade servers' firmware, and we train policies for this controller using a multi-criteria reward signal depending on both application performance and CPU power consumption. Our testbed scenario posed a number of challenges to successful use of RL, including multiple disparate reward functions, limited decision sampling rates, and pathologies arising when using multiple sensor readings as state variables. We describe innovative practical solutions to these challenges, and demonstrate clear performance improvements over both hand-designed policies as well as obvious \"cookbook\" RL implementations.", "authors": ["Gerald Tesauro", "Rajarshi Das", "Hoi Chan", "Jeffrey O.

{"abstract": "We address the problem of visual category recognition by learning an image-to-image distance function that attempts to satisfy the following property: the distance between images from the same category should be less than the distance between images from different categories. We use patch-based feature vectors common in object recognition work as a basis for our image-to-image distance functions. Our large-margin formulation for learning the distance functions is similar to formulations used in the machine learning literature on distance metric learning, however we differ in that we learn local distance functions?a different parameterized function for every image of our training set?whereas typically a single global distance function is learned. This was a novel approach first introduced in Frome, Singer, & Malik, NIPS 2006. In that work we learned the local distance functions independently, and the outputs of these functions could not be compared at test time without the use of additional heuristics or training. Here we introduce a different approach that has the advantage that it learns distance functions that are globally consistent in that they can be directly compared for purposes of retrieval and classification. The output of the learning algorithm are weights assigned to the image features, which is intuitively appealing in the computer vision setting: some features are more salient than others, and which are more salient depends on the category, or image, being considered.

We also show an important expressivity result for this language: If r and s are bounded, regular regions that are not related by an affine transformation, then they can be distinguished by a constraint network.

{"abstract": "News sources on the Web generate constant streams of information, describing many aspects of the events that shape our world. In particular, geography plays a key role in the news, and enabling geographic retrieval of news articles involves recognizing the textual references to geographic locations (called toponyms) present in the articles, which can be difficult due to ambiguity in natural language. Toponym recognition in news is often accomplished with algorithms designed and tested around small corpora of news articles, but these static collections do not reflect the streaming nature of online news, as evidenced by poor performance in tests. In contrast, a method for toponym recognition is presented that is tuned for streaming news by leveraging a wide variety of recognition components, both rule-based and statistical. An evaluation of this method shows that it outperforms two prominent toponym recognition systems when tested on large datasets of streaming news, indicating its suitability for this domain.", "authors": ["Michael D.

{"abstract": "a b s t r a c t This paper addresses the distributed finite-time tracking control problem for second-order multi-agent systems. First, we propose a finite-time tracking protocol for multi-agent systems by using state feedback. Then, a new class of observer-based control algorithms are designed for achieving finite-time consensus tracking in multi-agent systems with a single active leader, where each agent can only share its position states with its neighbors. Within the same context, the present control algorithms are then extended to solve the finite-time containment tracking problem for multi-agent systems in the presence of multiple active leaders. It is theoretically shown that the position states of the followers will converge to that of the leader or a convex hull spanned by those of the leaders, respectively, in finite time. Furthermore, the finite-time formation control problem is discussed. The effectiveness of the results is also illustrated by numerical simulations.", "authors": ["Yu Zhao", "Zhisheng Duan", "Guanghui Wen", "Yanjiao Zhang"], "n_citation": 143, "references": ["0bf829c3-d555-4745-b1a5-7c5ce8acbff6", "2768199c-b9d6-4001-94d3-e6429c93bc5f", "29077c3a-7d4f-4c52-8165-ac6578b8ef4b", "5533d72d-301f-44ad-8127-f79aeed08b90", "55a0b493-6eda-4115-ba91-76a2e292b490", "727a097a-adb8-4efe-8c20-cae35f74d9e7", "761d5c01-4b34-4d4c-9e6e-8aa933c64627", "8efffaa2-6401-4a06-8b96-f2cfa21086c4", "9a9a2544-3715-4d89-aa04-fdf234e95b2f", "9d45fda2-5a1b-4f14-87a4-03869fc6960b", "a10baab0-d104-470b-8a01-fc61ed7fedd5", "bf08e9ce-0001-4bcd-8e3b-9ee28e6cd4f5", "d63aeb27-62f3-4d6e-a6df-aed1f6a74609", "d7b5aadf-ec30-4fb7-9224-7474169d3744", "ea1d5c21-fba6-4fae-9fdc-ee7679ee46c9", "f090b900-9d8e-4f67-8103-2707b9f6a64c"], "title": "Distributed finite-time tracking control for multi-agent systems: An observer-based approach", "venue": "Systems & Control Letters", "year": 2013, "id": "f09a1051-6675-4fa8-bd1c-d586aede5cf9"}

Here we show that when attention is restricted tostructured programswhich we define to be programs whose control-flow graphs are series-parallel, there is an efficient algorithm that produces a solution which is within a factor of 2 of the optimal solution. We note that even with the previous restriction the resulting coloring problem is NP-complete.We also consider how to delete a minimum number of edges from arbitrary control-flow graphs to make them series-parallel and to apply our algorithm. We show that this problem is MaxSNP hard. However, we define the notion of anapproximate articulation pointand we give efficient algorithms to find approximate articulation points.

{"abstract": "A frequency domain model of the filtered LMS algorithm is presented for analyzing the behavior of the weights during adaptation. In particular, expressions for stable operation of the algorithm are derived as a function of the algorithm step size, the input signal power, and the transfer functions of the linear filters. The expressions show that algorithm stability can be achieved over a frequency band of interest by inserting an appropriately chosen delay in the reference input to the LMS algorithm weight update equation. This result implies that it is not necessary to use a training mode to estimate the loop transfer functions before or during adaptation if the input is limited to a band of frequencies. It is only necessary to know the approximate delay introduced by the transfer functions in the band. The single delay parameter can be estimated much more easily than the entire transfer function. Simulations of the time domain algorithm are presented to support the theoretical predictions of the frequency domain model. >", "authors": ["Paul L. Feintuch", "Neil J. Bershad", "Allen K.

{"abstract": "In the personal or corporate spheres, the home/office of tomorrow is soon to be the home/office of today, with a plethora of networked devices embedded in appliances, such as mobile phones, televisions, thermostats, and lamps, making it possible to automate and remotely control many basic household functions with a high degree of accuracy. In this domain, technological standardization is still in its infancy, or remains fragmented. The different functionalities of the various appliances, as well as market factors, imply that the devices that control them communicate via a multitude of different protocols (KNX, LonWorks, InOne). Building a high level middleware to support all the appliances seems to be a reasonable approach. However, market factors has shown that the emergence of a unique and universal middleware is a dream. To solve this issue, we have built a new generation of schizophrenic middleware in which service access can be generated from an abstract services description. EnTiMid, our implementation of schizophrenic middleware, supports various services access models (several personalities): SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), UPnP and DPWS (Device Profile for WebServices). In this paper, we describe how these personalities are generated using a Model Driven Engineering approach and discuss the benefits of our approach in the context of a deployment of new services at the city level.", "authors": ["Gr\u00e9gory Nain", "Erwan Daubert", "Olivier Barais", "Jean-Marc J\u00e9z\u00e9quel"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["13b2bc76-1f87-4ca6-898b-e611ef64be2c", "1bc2d89e-12ba-4145-aaea-38e498d15472", "1d53ea02-d6b1-4629-88fe-d753b9c29e29", "296ff3e6-df4c-4eac-8c5a-f551bf2723b9", "4f736331-4663-4b8b-8317-c04c59b32a25", "5df1cecb-3b95-47d1-981a-d9d10a5819d0", "b8fdd037-a291-4bbb-b665-de3901ea6f78", "de8747c3-2593-402a-915d-488d52495e49"], "title": "Using MDE to Build a Schizophrenic Middleware for Home/Building Automation", "venue": "", "year": 2008, "id": "99f9c597-8d7b-4c5c-8ad8-9b2c6c7624b1"}

Giotto consists of a programming language with a formal semantics, and a retargetable compiler and runtime library. Giotto supports the automation of control system design by strictly separating platform-independent functionality and timing concerns from platform-dependent scheduling and communication issues. The time-triggered predictability of Giotto makes it particularly suitable for safety-critical applications with hard real-time constraints.

With this approach, while designers and agents still use a highly abstract organisational modelling language to specify and reason about the multi-agent organisation, the development of the organisation management infrastructure is facilitated in the following manner. The high-level organisation specification is automatically translated into a simple normative programming language that we have recently introduced and for which we have given formal semantics. The organisation management infrastructure can then be based on an interpreter for the simpler normative language. We illustrate the approach showing how MOISE's organisation modelling language (with primitives such as roles, groups, and goals) can be translated into our normative programming language (with primitives such as norms and obligations).

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of distributed convergence to a Nash equilibrium in a noncooperative game where the players generate their actions based only on online measurements of their individual cost functions, corrupted with additive measurement noise. Exact analytical forms and/or parameters of the cost functions, as well as the current actions of the players may be unknown. Additionally, the players' actions are subject to linear dynamic constraints. We propose an algorithm based on discrete-time stochastic extremum seeking using sinusoidal perturbations and prove its almost sure convergence to a Nash equilibrium. We show how the proposed algorithm can be applied to solving coordination problems in mobile sensor networks, where motion dynamics of the players can be modeled as: 1) single integrators (velocity-actuated vehicles), 2) double integrators (force-actuated vehicles), and 3) unicycles (a kinematic model with nonholonomic constraints). Examples are given in which the cost functions are selected such that the problems of connectivity control, formation control, rendezvous and coverage control are solved in an adaptive and distributed way. The methodology is illustrated through simulations.", "authors": ["Milos S. Stankovic", "Karl Henrik Johansson", "Dusan M.

{"abstract": "In this paper we propose two novel and computationally efficient metaheuristic algorithms based on tabu search (TS) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) principles for locating the sensor nodes in a distributed wireless sensor network (WSN) environment. The WSN localization problem is formulated as a non-linear optimization problem with mean squared range error resulting from noisy distance measurement as the objective function. Unlike gradient descent methods, both TS and PSO methods ensure minimization of the objective function without the solution being trapped into local optima. We further implement a refinement phase with error propagation control for improvement of the results. The performance of the proposed algorithms are compared with each other and also against simulated annealing based WSN localization. The effects of range measurement error, anchor node density and uncertainty in the anchor node position on localization performance are also studied through various simulations. The simulation results establish better accuracy, computational efficiency and convergence characteristics for TS and PSO methods. Further, the efficacy of the proposed methods is verified with data collected from an experimental sensor network reported in the literature.", "authors": ["Aloor Gopakumar", "Lillykutty Jacob"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["103e12c7-7e82-4a02-a695-155e93f74e14", "1d1a9a9c-a8fd-4b55-9137-5331dbfb6720", "1e4e8925-3328-4af5-be88-56eef2f6aa8f", "2319c4d9-8fab-4e4d-a6ca-6df7b9e7dbae", "465b5873-fad1-4889-85d1-3b23614bf8fa", "53f2555d-cbf0-479c-b708-6c3c120c0ed2", "5dcaac45-c064-4034-b674-20976bfb05db", "5f67c0fb-fac5-4aea-8427-30c34800898b", "63131334-0c3b-4ded-9abd-4337d9ea3c09", "743d5a70-0aab-4039-934f-6503ebbfb541", "760a3bb0-2820-4725-a83f-4ba2ed753da1", "8eff2d68-96d4-4b2c-b1ba-30b24ea74af6", "a92db865-e74e-40a3-9c94-d6b6b2b6f4a1", "b0fb08ef-1380-449e-bb5d-63d9571533aa", "bde192d3-9a20-493c-913b-9a7c43ae435b", "bfcca5fe-910c-4623-a3c0-12290ac78eb7", "cd89fa39-79c8-40ae-9c5d-8ac4a1bb8c48", "f2c1743e-f372-4e2b-b925-8fbdbf178dc6"], "title": "Performance of some metaheuristic algorithms for localization in wireless sensor networks", "venue": "International Journal of Network Management", "year": 2009, "id": "bb098b04-d5fc-4ada-bb37-7e48fcfd97ed"}

{"abstract": "A well-designed database that contains relevant, nonredundant, and consistent data is rarely achieved in practice. One major reason for this is seen to be the lack of effective support for logical database design. In view of this, the structured entity model (SEM) method, an object-oriented method which facilitates the logical design phases of database system development was developed. Because, unlike most methods, SEM does not require designers to understand normalization theory in order to design a logical database, an end user (or a novice designer) can successfully complete logical database design using the method. >", "authors": ["Kunihiko Higa", "Olivia R.

In W-ATM networks, a VC terminating at a mobile user may require dynamic reestablishment during the short time span necessary for terminal handover due to its movement from one (macro)cell to another. The VC reestablishment procedure has to ensure in-sequence and loss-free delivery of the ATM cells containing user data. After a classification of the solutions proposed so far in the literature, a novel technique for the dynamic reestablishment of VCs in W-ATM networks is described, and its performance is evaluated through simulation.

{"abstract": "We study communication primitives for interaction between mobile agents. They can be classified into two groups. At a low level there are location dependent primitives that require a programmer to know the current site of a mobile agent in order to communicate with it. At a high level there are location independent primitives that allow communication with a mobile agent irrespective of its current site and of any migrations. Implementation of these requires delicate distributed infrastructure. We propose a simple calculus of agents that allows implementations of such distributed infrastructure algorithms to be expressed as encodings, or compilations, of the whole calculus into the fragment with only location dependent communication. These encodings give executable descriptions of the algorithms, providing a clean implementation strategy for prototype languages. The calculus is equipped with a precise semantics, providing a solid basis for understanding the algorithms and for reasoning about their correctness and robustness.

The scenario analysis defines how web resources are accessed, used, and changed by whom. The method also defines attributes of each web resource, which are used in maintaining the resource.

{"abstract": "Abstract   UML is the OMG standard notation for object-oriented modeling. It is easy, graphical and appealing, but in several cases still too imprecise. UML is strong as modeling means, supplies several different diagrammatic notations for representing the different aspects of a system under development, but lacks simulation and verifiability capabilities. This drawback comes from its semi-formal nature: UML is extremely precise and wide if we consider syntactical aspects, but its semantics is as precise as those of informal notations. Scientists and users, together with standardization efforts (UML 2.0), are trying to overcome this problem, but as side effect, they are also limiting the intrinsic flexibility of UML. Moreover, several formalization efforts concentrated on its static elements (for example, inheritance), leaving dynamic semantics almost untouched.  In this paper we propose the paring of UML dynamic models with high-level timed Petri nets (HLTPN) to obtain a flexible and customizable means to reason on the dynamic aspects of object-oriented models, to simulate particular parts of these models, and if necessary analyze them. The proposal exploits rules to ascribe main UML elements with formal semantics in terms of functionally equivalent HLTPNs and to show results (from execution and analysis) as decorations to UML symbols. Besides sketching the approach, the paper presents also some experiences we have gained so far with it and a research agenda to identify other possible uses of the dual definition of the notation.", "authors": ["Luciano Baresi", "Mauro Pezz\u00e8"], "n_citation": 57, "references": ["4bcc7161-b2ea-4927-ba2e-58044d5d9053", "5377916d-b86d-43cc-9dd7-76f0d221424a", "67120e1a-8bad-4558-9624-65e72e032417", "8a2be096-5f97-4c6f-be32-a87776f01159", "baea0120-b088-48b2-8fa7-e2ecfb64f532", "bbe45468-c69c-4794-a54f-856d31e96ca1", "d601d8d4-f9c5-446c-bd9a-8b85fabe29cc", "d96bf751-f95f-4c1a-b833-e5a3964e9c2b", "dc25a1a4-bf1f-46d4-a4cc-832da50d7ca8"], "title": "Improving UML with Petri nets.", "venue": "Electronic Notes in Theoretical Computer Science", "year": 2001, "id": "c9b5dc92-c0c3-46aa-9b18-568908fd8b33"}

The algorithm routes messages along the optimal, i.e., the shortest path if no faults are encountered or if the faults are such that an optimal path still exists. In the absence of an optimal path, the algorithm always finds a path between two nodes within a bounded number of hops if the two nodes are connected. Otherwise, it returns the message to the originating node. The authors provide a performance analysis for the case where an optimal path does not exist. They prove that for a maximum of n-2 faults on a graph with N=n! nodes, at most 2i+2 steps are added to the path, where i is O( square root n). Finally, they use the routing algorithm to present an efficient broadcast algorithm on the star graph in the presence of faults. >", "authors": ["Nader Bagherzadeh", "Nayla Nassif", "Shahram Latifi"], "n_citation": 95, "references": ["89e6e5a7-93f2-48bd-88fb-b5f7677574b6", "d05e84a0-ec0f-41f5-bc9a-6815dd99d07d", "f7b70191-fcd2-44de-9096-e7a8369d7c98"], "title": "A routing and broadcasting scheme on faulty star graphs", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computers", "year": 1993, "id": "c1a85f32-4b70-41d7-8ec8-e87492763786"}

{"abstract": "We present a taxonomy for Information Visualization (IV) that characterizes it in terms of data, task, skill and context, as well as a number of dimensions that relate to the input and output hardware, the software tools, as well as user interactions and human perceptual abilities. We illustrate the utility of the taxonomy by focusing particularly on the information retrieval task and the importance of taking into account human perceptual capabilities and limitations. Although the relevance of Psychology to IV is often recognised, we have seen relatively little translation of psychological results and theory to practical IV applications.This paper targets the better development of information visualizations through the introduction of a framework delineating the major factors in interface development. We believe that higher quality visualizations will result from structured developments that take into account these considerations and that the framework will also serve to assist the development of effective evaluation and assessment processes.", "authors": ["Darius Pfitzner", "Vaughan Hobbs", "David M.

While recently proposed kernels based on common subgraphs (Wale et al., 2008; Shervashidze et al., 2009) in general can not be applied to attributed graphs, our approach allows to rate mappings of subgraphs by a exible scoring scheme comparing vertex and edge attributes by kernels. We show that subgraph matching kernels generalize several known kernels. To compute the kernel we propose a graph-theoretical algorithm inspired by a classical relation between common subgraphs of two graphs and cliques in their product graph observed by Levi (1973).

{"abstract": "To become interaction-aware, an autonomic cyber-physical system needs to be aware of its physical environment and whereabouts and its current internal status. This ability is defined as artificial awareness and it helps intelligent software-intensive systems perceive changes, draw inferences for their own behavior and react. Originally, artificial awareness depends on the knowledge we transfer to a system and how we make the system use that knowledge, so it can exhibit intelligence. Artificial awareness requires a means of sensing changes, so the external and internal worlds can be perceived through their raw events and data. To build an efficient awareness mechanism, we need to provide a means of monitoring and knowledge representation along with a proper reasoner deriving awareness conclusions. In this paper, we present an approach to implementing artificial awareness with KnowLang, a special framework for knowledge representation and reasoning. KnowLang provides for a special knowledge context and a special reasoner operating in that context. The reasoner communicates with the host system via special ASK and TELL operators allowing for awareness conclusions and updates.", "authors": ["Emil Vassev", "Mike Hinchey"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["46d6e0d3-c130-4e29-bff9-2a4fd3c59caf", "88f9167e-0cf5-4698-99e5-33c9b187383c", "8b9cdebe-b5c2-48d3-b86e-d256455cce53", "97221dcf-729b-4f4d-9255-e1ea540d59af", "a42c80d4-35e8-4234-aff1-3221a1f8ce97", "ab274ed1-1e70-4f68-9b5c-f74565629791", "e2d57ee5-3cc9-4e0e-b50c-4fad08ce9915", "f08bd37e-c77c-401a-a787-495f2246705f", "f4896738-7b31-420e-9b23-6093f05dd8d5"], "title": "Implementing artificial awareness with KnowLang", "venue": "", "year": 2013, "id": "64646356-6e33-44af-97e1-978eaf4d664d"}

{"abstract": "During debugging, a developer must repeatedly and manually reproduce faulty behavior in order to inspect different facets of the program's execution. Existing tools for reproducing such behaviors prevent the use of debugging aids such as breakpoints and logging, and are not designed for interactive, random-access exploration of recorded behavior. This paper presents Timelapse, a tool for quickly recording, reproducing, and debugging interactive behaviors in web applications. Developers can use Timelapse to browse, visualize, and seek within recorded program executions while simultaneously using familiar debugging tools such as breakpoints and logging. Testers and end-users can use Timelapse to demonstrate failures in situ and share recorded behaviors with developers, improving bug report quality by obviating the need for detailed reproduction steps. Timelapse is built on Dolos, a novel record/replay infrastructure that ensures deterministic execution by capturing and reusing program inputs both from the user and from external sources such as the network. Dolos introduces negligible overhead and does not interfere with breakpoints and logging. In a small user evaluation, participants used Timelapse to accelerate existing reproduction activities, but were not significantly faster or more successful in completing the larger tasks at hand. Together, the Dolos infrastructure and Timelapse developer tool support systematic bug reporting and debugging practices.", "authors": ["Brian Burg", "Richard Bailey", "Andrew J. Ko", "Michael D.

In addition, it also enables active force control within the compliant hybrid zero dynamics allowing within-stride adjustments of the effective stance leg stiffness. The proposed control strategy was implemented on and resulted in a kneed-biped running record of 3.06 m/s (10.9 kph or 6.8 mph).", "authors": ["Koushil Sreenath", "Hae Won Park", "Ioannis Poulakakis", "Jessy W.

{"abstract": "A logical system of inference rules intended to give the foundation of logic programs is presented. The distinguished point of the approach taken here is the application of the theory of inductive definitions, which allows us to uniformly treat various kinds of induction schema and also allows us to regardnegation as failure as a kind of induction schema. This approach corresponds to the so-called least fixpoint semantics. Moreover, in our formalism, logic programs are extended so that a condition of a clause may be any first-order formula. This makes it possible to write a quantified specification as a logic program. It also makes the class of induction schemata much larger to include the usual course-of-values inductions.", "authors": ["Masami Hagiya", "Takafumi Sakurai"], "n_citation": 32, "references": ["142e2eeb-28b8-49a2-8174-c83ba7cd89eb", "5f1e8f0b-e9aa-4354-b449-ae6dd26dab50", "9f80a041-d5ed-4f55-8d58-888bea30cbb6", "b01ab199-bf93-4153-82fe-093744dbd355", "c2e54a08-5059-43dc-a4c1-a1c8572a1247"], "title": "Foundation of Logic Programming Based on Inductive Definition", "venue": "New Generation Computing", "year": 1984, "id": "80bec2ce-81c0-4c1a-95f2-f288603ef3a1"}
{"abstract": "Dynamic multi-user interactions within a distributed collaborative virtual environment (CVE) suffer from abrupt state transitions due to communication delays-an action by one user only becoming apparent to another user after the delay. This results in a divergence of the environment for the duration of the delay, followed by an abrupt jump to resynchronise, so that the current state of the virtual world is displayed. Such discontinuities do not occur in the real world and thus appear unnatural and disconcerting to the users. This paper develops the concept of a 3 1/2 D perception model, as an alternative to prediction, which locally filters the underlying model, ensuring that each user views a continuous version of the environment, such that no jumps occur, despite delays arising from remote user interaction. Each user's 3 1/2 D filter is specific to their own circumstances, so that each user's perception of the environment is slightly different from that of other users.", "authors": ["Paul M.

{"abstract": "This paper describes results about the development of a repeatable and configurable robotic finger designed to pluck harp strings. Eventually, this device will be a tool to study string instruments in playing conditions. We use a classical robot with two degrees of freedom enhanced with silicone fingertips. The validation method requires a comparison with real harpist performance. A specific experimental setup using a high-speed camera combined with an accelerometer was carried out. It provides finger and string trajectories during the whole plucking action and the soundboard vibrations during the string oscillations. A set of vibrational features are then extracted from these signals to compare robotic finger to harpist plucking actions. These descriptors have been analyzed on six fingertips of various shapes and hardnesses. Results allow to select the optimal shape and hardness among the silicone fingertips according to vibrational features.", "authors": ["Delphine Chadefaux", "Jean-Lo\u00efc Le Carrou", "Marie-Aude Vitrani", "Sylvere Billout", "Laurent Quartier"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["3871f929-30c5-4831-b594-4ccac770ba13", "3df5d447-464a-4fe6-bc71-a9fcc0b2d9bf", "443fb8d3-09ba-45a2-98a6-597799c3e63c", "5052cd30-652d-4171-b0b4-c69bf84004af", "5851a28b-ddd6-4d8a-9687-83f1668a237e", "5a77c083-6126-494f-9051-486bf89a3566", "88979d24-752e-4386-ae4c-5f606a12929e", "ca047740-738a-4488-9613-e051691f3071"], "title": "Harp plucking robotic finger", "venue": "intelligent robots and systems", "year": 2012, "id": "a54b9eb3-5751-4e7d-b6c2-e5edc5a4acde"}
{"abstract": "Cooperative distributed problem solving (CDPS) loosely-coupled agents can be effectively modeled as a distributed constraint satisfaction problem (DCSP) where each agent has multiple local variables. DCSP protocols typically impose (partial) orders on agents ensure systematic exploration of the search space, but the ordering decisions can have a dramatic effect on the overall problem-solving effort. In this paper, we examine several heuristics for ordering agents, and conclude that the best heuristics attempt to order agents based on the cumulative difficulty of finding assignments to their local variables. Less costly heuristics are sometimes also effective depending on the structure of the variables\u2019 constraints, and we describe the tradeoffs between heuristic cost and quality.

{"abstract": "Independent component analysis (ICA) has recently been proposed as a tool to unmix hyperspectral data. ICA is founded on two assumptions: 1) the observed spectrum vector is a linear mixture of the constituent spectra (endmember spectra) weighted by the correspondent abundance fractions (sources); 2)sources are statistically independent. Independent factor analysis (IFA) extends ICA to linear mixtures of independent sources immersed in noise. Concerning hyperspectral data, the first assumption is valid whenever the multiple scattering among the distinct constituent substances (endmembers) is negligible, and the surface is partitioned according to the fractional abundances. The second assumption, however, is violated, since the sum of abundance fractions associated to each pixel is constant due to physical constraints in the data acquisition process. Thus, sources cannot be statistically independent, this compromising the performance of ICA/IFA algorithms in hyperspectral unmixing. This paper studies the impact of hyperspectral source statistical dependence on ICA and IFA performances. We conclude that the accuracy of these methods tends to improve with the increase of the signature variability, of the number of endmembers, and of the signal-to-noise ratio. In any case, there are always endmembers incorrectly unmixed. We arrive to this conclusion by minimizing the mutual information of simulated and real hyperspectral mixtures. The computation of mutual information is based on fitting mixtures of Gaussians to the observed data. A method to sort ICA and IFA estimates in terms of the likelihood of being correctly unmixed is proposed.", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 M. P. Nascimento", "Jos\u00e9 M. B.

{"abstract": "To match an ideal Internet gateway which rigorously enforces fair sharing among competing TCP connections, an ideal TCP sender should possess two properties while obeying congestion avoidance and control principles. First, the TCP sender which under-uses network resources should avoid retransmission time-outs. When experiencing network congestion, a TCP connection should not time-out unless it has already reduced its congestion window to one packet but still cannot survive. Second, the TCP sender which over-uses network resources should lower its bandwidth. The congestion window for a connection should decrease each time a lost packet is detected because an ideal gateway will drop packets, during congestion, with a probability proportional to the bandwidth of the connection. Following these guidelines, we propose network-sensitive Reno (Net Reno), a set of optimizations that can be added to a traditional Reno TCP sender. Using the TCP's self-clocking property and the packet conservation rule, Net Reno improves Reno and its variants (New-Reno and SACK), in reducing TCP retransmission time-outs (RTOs) and in being conservative in network usage during the fast recovery phase. We have shown that over 85% of RTOs are due to small congestion windows that prevent fast retransmission and recovery algorithms from being effective. This implies that sophisticated recovery schemes such as SACK will have limited benefits for these loads. Net Reno overcomes this problem with a small window optimization. Net Reno can recover any number of packet losses without time-outs as long as the network keeps at least one packet alive for the connection.", "authors": ["Dong Lin", "H. T.

Unlike the other existing term weighting schemes such as TF-IDF and its variants, the proposed relevance measure takes into account the degree of relative participation of the term across all documents of the class to the entire population.

{"abstract": "Finding the location of a fault is a central task of debugging. Typically, a developer employs an interactive process for fault localization. To accelerate this task, several approaches have been proposed to automate fault localization. In practice, testing-based fault localization (TBFL), which uses test information to locate faults, has become a research focus. However, experimental results reported in the literature showed that current automation of fault localization can only serve as a means to confirming the search space and prioritizing search sequences, not a substitute of the interactive fault localization process. In this paper, we propose an approach based on test information to support the entire interactive fault localization process. During this process, the information gathered from previous interaction steps can be used to provide the ranking of suspicious statements for the current interaction step. As a feasibility study of our approach, we performed an experiment on applying our approach together with some other TBFL approaches on the Siemens programs, which have been used in the literature. Our experimental results show the effectiveness of our approach.", "authors": ["Dan Hao", "Lu Zhang", "Hong Mei", "Jiasu Sun"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1262ddb9-db76-450b-90b0-9dc19b422188", "260f7820-2e0a-469c-95a6-352e75a2f337", "2a5a04eb-0257-450a-b4a4-a5d2ede88755", "2c08d317-3848-40af-9dfa-20c8ce584ce9", "436e9234-5a25-4c27-93cd-545080494b47", "457a887b-0ff6-48f4-9413-c7785080fe86", "51ec1efd-db82-4dd1-b104-e4a8ba774d39", "5511b151-927c-4a7b-aaa3-9eff626512d3", "56159371-a48f-4a4c-8db6-9a1ee3ac6cbb", "694afab1-b902-4f99-9d3c-412e1f753b5e", "6fadeb8c-23a0-4f02-9534-54db8c8de6bf", "7f4b653f-3a52-41f8-9c4f-33313f82cb00", "8ce6d2da-e4ff-4b1d-abc3-a61e2cbf6ce1", "b2b822f4-070f-4b0e-8000-d49a6a709da8", "bf6c6d3f-980d-4b60-a863-05bcb88658bd", "c7dda81c-0759-4906-9b8c-dc02aafacb05", "cbaa2dcc-51db-4cfe-99d9-ce067ab0ccfb", "ddc4dea3-a9f4-4a19-9e43-d28977f675ac", "dedf1f56-0e5c-4dc4-b0f0-8d822a986471", "e360e774-e32f-483e-bd14-5b66c744a1f6", "eafe671d-f6eb-4a21-be0d-b7e697e04d70", "f912859b-270e-46e9-a960-b24df9786560"], "title": "Towards Interactive Fault Localization Using Test Information", "venue": "asia-pacific software engineering conference", "year": 2006, "id": "a8d85f2e-2f1f-4594-883d-821d7d441c07"}

{"abstract": "The interpretation of handwritten signature images should be closely related to the writer\u2019s identity. The representation and analysis of the handwritten signature is the major challenge in the field of automatic signature verification. A new concept of representation and interpretation of handwritten signature images is advocated. The segmentation process breaks up the signature into a collection of arbitrarily-shaped primitives. In the next step, a local interpretation process serves as a sophisticated template matching, permitting the labeling of all primitives from the test primitive set. This is followed by the global interpretation process, which permits the evaluation of a similarity measure between two structural graphs. Experimental results obtained from a database of 800 handwritten signature images from 20 writers show a performance with a type I error rate of \u22081=1.50%, a type II error rate of \u22082=1.37% and a total error rate \u2208t=1.43% in the best strategy proposed using a minimum-distance classifier and two reference signatures.

{"abstract": "We present a unified approach to noise removal, image enhancement, and shape recovery in images. The underlying approach relies on the level set formulation of the curve and surface motion, which leads to a class of PDE-based algorithms. Beginning with an image, the first stage of this approach removes noise and enhances the image by evolving the image under flow controlled by min/max curvature and by the mean curvature. This stage is applicable to both salt-and-pepper grey-scale noise and full-image continuous noise present in black and white images, grey-scale images, texture images, and color images. The noise removal/enhancement schemes applied in this stage contain only one enhancement parameter, which in most cases is automatically chosen. The other key advantage of our approach is that a stopping criteria is automatically picked from the image; continued application of the scheme produces no further change. The second stage of our approach is the shape recovery of a desired object; we again exploit the level set approach to evolve an initial curve/surface toward the desired boundary, driven by an image-dependent speed function that automatically stops at the desired boundary.", "authors": ["Ravikanth Malladi", "James A.

{"abstract": "The effect of subtractive digital dither on single-stage and multi-stage quantizers is examined. In the single stage case, it is proved that the conditional density of the quantization error becomes asymptotically independent of the input and uniformly distributed as the number of digital dither levels increases. For a fixed number of levels, the conditional expectation of a class of piecewise constant functions is shown to be independent of the input. A Fourier series representation of quantization error densities is used to construct a linear periodically time varying model of multistage quantization and dithering systems. For a homogeneous multi-stage quantization system, it is shown that when the least common multiple of the numbers of digital dither levels at successive stages is large, the statistical dependence of the quantization noise on the input disappears almost entirely.

{"abstract": "Abstract   Using problem-specific background knowledge, computer programs developed within the framework of Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) have been used to construct restricted first-order logic solutions to scientific problems. However, their approach to the analysis of data with substantial numerical content has been largely limited to constructing clauses that: (a) provide qualitative descriptions (\u201chigh\u201d, \u201clow\u201d etc.) of the values of response variables; and (b) contain simple inequalities restricting the ranges of predictor variables. This has precluded the application of such techniques to scientific and engineering problems requiring a more sophisticated approach. A number of specialised methods have been suggested to remedy this. In contrast, we have chosen to take advantage of the fact that the existing theoretical framework for ILP places very few restrictions of the nature of the background knowledge. We describe two issues of implementation that make it possible to use background predicates that implement well-established statistical and numerical analysis procedures. Any improvements in analytical sophistication that result are evaluated empirically using artificial and real-life data. Experiments utilising artificial data are concerned with extracting constraints for response variables in the text-book problem of balancing a pole on a cart. They illustrate the use of clausal definitions of arithmetic and trigonometric functions, inequalities, multiple linear regression, and numerical derivatives. A non-trivial problem concerning the prediction of mutagenic activity of nitroaromatic molecules is also examined. In this case, expert chemists have been unable to devise a model for explaining the data. The result demonstrates the combined use by an ILP program of logical and numerical capabilities to achieve an analysis that includes linear modelling, clustering and classification. In all experiments, the predictions obtained compare favourably against benchmarks set by more traditional methods of quantitative methods, namely, regression and neural-network.", "authors": ["Ashwin Srinivasan", "Rui Camacho"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["04cf5088-faf8-4c49-b1b3-899bb3e743ee", "18297d1a-edca-4997-b2cf-18b8b2817635", "247d38b3-c55c-4bdc-a187-875719e0e6f8", "3ef8d958-d114-4a62-88b8-414fa05a6d35", "4516543e-c8bb-4b21-818e-dad61ff606d0", "50d14644-93e6-41de-8751-0a6ec241701f", "50e5592d-e449-4b20-b271-6b5a4295ebf7", "64c5f28b-3fb4-4600-9e0b-37f96673f20f", "6dcb6d22-e7ad-446a-95d1-61948f2397d2", "8afef1a5-6b09-410b-9520-6fd9d082f70c", "b50343ea-567e-4e9d-9119-eba1f513e16c", "c03ddcdd-68b1-41af-82ec-ef09598d9cf0", "d1c40e9d-7e07-4911-b10c-90cdfd07dcf5"], "title": "Numerical reasoning with an ILP system capable of lazy evaluation and customised search", "venue": "Journal of Logic Programming", "year": 1999, "id": "73e8d584-fa0a-420c-bb9e-ca3ca32086cc"}

The proposed method achieves better clustering of similar records and avoids some of the (expensive) random disk accesses, replacing them with sequential ones. We develop a mathematical model, derive formulas giving the average performance of both methods and show that the proposed method achieves 0% - 50% relative savings over the binary codes.

{"abstract": "The Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) based methodology seems ideally suited for DNA sequence alignment due to its high speed and low space complexity. Despite being efficient in exact matching, the application of BWT in inexact matching still has problems due to the excessive backtracking process. This paper presents a hardware architecture for the BWT-based inexact sequence mapping algorithm using the Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). The proposed design can handle up to two errors, including mismatches and gaps. The original recursive algorithm implementation is dealt with using hierarchical tables, and is then parallelized to a large extension through a dual-base extension method. Extensive performance evaluations for the proposed architecture have been conducted using both Virtex 6 and Virtex 7 FPGAs. This design is considerably faster than a direct implementation. When compared with the popular software evaluation tool BWA, our architecture can achieve the same match quality tolerating up to two errors. In an execution speed comparison with the BWA aln process, our design outperforms a range of CPU platforms with multiple threads under the same configuration conditions.", "authors": ["Yao Xin", "Benben Liu", "Biao Min", "Will X.

{"abstract": "Electron microscope tomography has emerged as the leading technique for structure determination of cellular components with a resolution of a few nanometers, opening up exciting perspectives for visualizing the molecular architecture of the cytoplasm. This work describes and analyzes the parallelization of tomographic reconstruction algorithms for their application in electron microscope tomography of cellular structures. Efficient iterative algorithms that are characterized by a fast convergence rate have been used to tackle the image reconstruction problem. The use of smooth basis functions provides the reconstruction algorithms with an implicit regularization mechanism, very appropriate for highly noisy conditions such as those present in high-resolution electron tomographic studies. Parallel computing techniques have been applied so as to face the computational requirements demanded by the reconstruction of large volumes. An efficient domain decomposition scheme has been devised that leads to a parallel approach with capabilities of interprocessor communication latency hiding. The combination of efficient iterative algorithms and parallel computing techniques have proved to be well suited for the reconstruction of large biological specimens in electron tomography, yielding solutions in reasonable computational times. This work concludes that parallel computing will be the key to afford high-resolution structure determination of cells, so that the location of molecular signatures in their native cellular context can be made a reality.", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9-Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez", "Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Carazo", "Inmaculada Garc\u00eda"], "n_citation": 58, "references": ["17ee53fd-61b2-4e78-8901-c4b0639a17fd", "251cab32-7659-4215-8c7c-457fdaff3b1d", "787f7bdc-1629-456b-ab9d-4c88f39b866c", "9d82ba90-9444-445b-bc1d-924df8072805", "a2fca88b-5180-4fdd-b6f1-5dc4b4aa42a4", "e5f4420e-705c-4cd0-9616-d5a417012bca"], "title": "Three-dimensional reconstruction of cellular structures by electron microscope tomography and parallel computing", "venue": "Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing", "year": 2004, "id": "4e16907a-d7b0-48c4-bf30-178a7257586c"}
{"abstract": "Content delivery has become an important enterprise on the Internet. There exists a huge demand for bandwidth-intensive, rich multimedia content like news, entertainment services and software. Two key issues associated with any content-delivery system are: revenue and user satisfaction. We explore the domain of pricing for content delivery, and how it relates to revenue, and system utilization. A fundamental contribution of this paper is to consider a probabilistic user behavior model where users can refuse the offered service based on their capacity to pay and the price quoted. As a first step, we consider a system which delivers multimedia content on a first-come-first-served basis, and analyze pricing mechanisms which maximize the expectation of revenue. We argue that charging a constant price based on the customers' capacities to pay maximizes the expected revenue. Since the customers' capacities are highly varying and not known beforehand, we develop an adaptive pricing model and validate it using simulation. Our simulation results indicate that the adaptive pricing scheme generates nearly the same revenue as the theoretical expectation.", "authors": ["Srinivasan Jagannathan", "Kevin C.

Unlike liquid crystal displays (LCD), OLED displays consume dramatically different power for showing different colors. In particular, OLED displays are inefficient for showing bright colors.

To tackle this problem, we present the motivational studies, design, and realization of Chameleon, a color adaptive web browser that renders webpages with power-optimized color schemes under user-supplied constraints. Driven by the findings from our motivational studies, Chameleon provides end users with important options, offloads tasks that are not absolutely needed in real time, and accomplishes real-time tasks by carefully enhancing the codebase of a browser engine.

{"abstract": "Form based visual programming languages, which include electronic spreadsheets and a variety of research systems, have had a substantial impact on end user computing. Research shows that form based visual programs often contain faults, and that their creators often have unwarranted confidence in the reliability of their programs. Despite this evidence, we find no discussion in the research literature of techniques for testing or assessing the reliability of form based visual programs. The paper addresses this lack. We describe differences between the form based and imperative programming paradigms, and discuss effects these differences have on strategies for testing form based programs. We then present several test adequacy criteria for form based programs, and illustrate their application. We show that an analogue to the traditional \"all-uses\" dataflow test adequacy criterion is well suited for code based testing of form based visual programs: it provides important error detection ability, and can be applied more easily to form based programs than to imperative programs.", "authors": ["Gregg Rothermel", "Lixin Li", "Margaret M.

{"abstract": "For physical human-robot interaction, safety and dependability are of utmost importance due to the potential risk a relatively powerful robot poses for human beings. From the control standpoint, it is possible to increase this level of safety by guaranteeing that the robot will never exhibit any unstable behaviour. However, stability is not the only concern in the design of a controller for such a robot. During human-robot interaction, the resulting cooperative motion should be truly intuitive and should not restrict in any way the human performance. For this purpose, we have designed a new variable admittance control law that guarantees the stability of the robot during constrained motion and also provides a very intuitive human interaction. The first characteristic is provided by the design of a stability observer while the other is based on a variable admittance control scheme that uses the force derivative as a way to predict human intention. The stability observer is based on a previous stability investigation of cooperative motion which implies the knowledge of the interaction stiffness. A method to accurately estimate this stiffness online using the data coming from the encoder and from a multi-axis force sensor at the end effector is also provided. The stability and intuitivity of the control law were verified in a user study during a cooperative drawing task with a 3 degree-of-freedom (dof) parallel robot.", "authors": ["Vincent Duchaine", "Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin"], "n_citation": 59, "references": ["135e7d61-b094-4535-9ad0-59a19000c785", "296fe49c-76ed-49dc-850e-505641602650", "36a5984a-2e4f-4b0f-9ed4-fb6befcfeb11", "38aaedb7-0986-4b22-8507-4ce9f077f4f9", "660e9a21-e45e-4496-ba42-951fccf6453a", "a14da6b0-0de2-49a6-8805-6c4a3bfd9c79", "adc02309-d719-4743-9dd2-fb699f104dfc", "b5aabdd7-5634-4a5e-b076-c482f2e5e348", "d84c7d72-5d42-40f2-a534-f2a245768f48"], "title": "Safe, Stable and Intuitive Control for Physical Human-Robot Interaction", "venue": "international conference on robotics and automation", "year": 2009, "id": "43cceca9-3ed7-4c54-bd04-42242eb8341f"}
{"abstract": "Although researchers have studied which factors influence the behavior of traditional search algorithms, currently not much is known about how domain properties influence the performance of real-time search algorithms. In this paper we demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that Eulerian state spaces (a superset of undirected state spaces) are very easy for some existing real-time search algorithms to solve: even real-time search algorithms that can be intractable, in general, are efficient for Eulerian state spaces. Because traditional real-time search testbeds (such as the eight puzzle and gridworlds) are Eulerian, they cannot be used to distinguish between efficient and inefficient real-time search algorithms. It follows that one has to use non-Eulerian domains to demonstrate the general superiority of a given algorithm. To this end, we present two classes of hard-to-search state spaces and demonstrate the performance of various real-time search algorithms on them.", "authors": ["Sven Koenig", "Reid G.

{"abstract": "The authors describe a control system for a binocular image acquisition mechanism, for use in mobile robotic systems, which allows shifts in focus of attenuation to be made in a natural, device-independent manner. The control method is based on the modal control technique proposed by R.W. Brockett (Proc. IEEE Robotics Autom. Conf., 1988). The shifts are accomplished by altering the feedback gains applied to the visual feedback paths in the position and velocity control loops of the binocular camera system.

{"abstract": "A new approach to position control based on microstepping with nonlinear torque modulation in permanent magnet stepper motors is explored in this paper. The proposed method consists of nonlinear torque modulation, a commutation scheme, and a nonlinear current tracking controller. Previous microstepping control methods that guarantee the desired currents have relatively large position tracking errors due to their mechanical dynamics. A method of nonlinear torque modulation is designed to solve this problem. We propose a commutation scheme that is equivalent to microstepping in which the desired currents have time-varying amplitudes with \u03c0 over 2 electrical phase advance. The nonlinear controller in the electrical dynamics is developed to guarantee the desired current derived by the commutation scheme. The proposed control method is in the form of field oriented control (FOC) even though direct quadrature transformation so that the zero direct current is kept to maximize the torque. Thus, the efficiency of the energy consumption of the proposed method is better those that of previous microstepping control methods for guarantees of the desired currents. The performance of the proposed position control method was validated through simulations.", "authors": ["Won Hee Kim", "Donghoon Shin", "Chung Choo Chung"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["52763d94-8906-41a0-90c1-f831d032d31a", "7a7a10e4-d93f-42d1-b353-2a6d908498dd", "b87f88f4-f370-4ae9-a37c-1b925fc63a8a"], "title": "Microstepping with nonlinear torque modulation for position tracking control in permanent magnet stepper motors", "venue": "conference on decision and control", "year": 2011, "id": "350b9a6a-2688-4896-87c8-8e4158765def"}
{"abstract": "Today's data networks are surprisingly fragile and difficult to manage. We argue that the root of these problems lies in the complexity of the control and management planes--the software and protocols coordinating network elements--and particularly the way the decision logic and the distributed-systems issues are inexorably intertwined. We advocate a complete refactoring of the functionality and propose three key principles--network-level objectives, network-wide views, and direct control--that we believe should underlie a new architecture. Following these principles, we identify an extreme design point that we call \"4D,\" after the architecture's four planes: decision, dissemination, discovery, and data. The 4D architecture completely separates an AS's decision logic from pro-tocols that govern the interaction among network elements. The AS-level objectives are specified in the decision plane, and en-forced through direct configuration of the state that drives how the data plane forwards packets. In the 4D architecture, the routers and switches simply forward packets at the behest of the decision plane, and collect measurement data to aid the decision plane in controlling the network. Although 4D would involve substantial changes to today's control and management planes, the format of data packets does not need to change; this eases the deployment path for the 4D architecture, while still enabling substantial innovation in network control and management. We hope that exploring an extreme design point will help focus the attention of the research and industrial communities on this crucially important and intellectually challenging area.", "authors": ["Albert G.

We observe that repeatability is more an artifact of how computation is expressed, and less of program inputs.

A modified version of regular expressions called Fusion Expressions is used as part of an intermediate logic called Fusion Logic. Both have the same expressiveness as PITL but are lower-level notations which play an important role in the hierarchical structure of the overall completeness proof.

A given packet header can match multiple filters, so each filter is given a cost, and the packet is forwarded using the  least cost matching filter .In this paper, we describe two new algorithms for solving the least cost matching filter problem at high speeds. Our first algorithm is based on a grid-of-tries construction and works optimally for processing filters consisting of two prefix fields (such as destination-source filters) using linear space. Our second algorithm, cross-producting, provides fast lookup times for arbitrary filters but potentially requires large storage. We describe a combination scheme that combines the advantages of both schemes. The combination scheme can be optimized to handle pure destination prefix filters in 4 memory accesses, destination-source filters in 8 memory accesses worst case, and all other filters in 11 memory accesses in the typical case.", "authors": ["Venkatachary Srinivasan", "George Varghese", "Subhash Suri", "Marcel Waldvogel"], "n_citation": 784, "references": ["35bf84dd-82f4-4a45-a114-bfe8c635c2c4", "371e3a51-581b-416a-b59f-1cbe80471f31", "510eec1d-f82c-4b19-b116-b8fd4c66531a", "56fad217-58da-4f8a-8898-dc293ebc2002", "5aece226-0c05-46c2-9b78-3447e0065e39", "6008f8ae-8540-4b75-921f-463e25e10257", "ae941637-b658-4a15-be8d-f32109e5f510", "d4147d25-c3a2-4604-aab1-be9c7df581a8", "d6ffd0e7-61aa-4dea-9fe0-4345e2382e96", "dd4fe4cb-b693-4ba9-aba1-fd858c3961b5", "e401b22f-f2eb-483a-ad16-3b36bba814a4", "e80c59fb-2f00-48b1-845a-a46e18afca99", "fb384998-25db-438d-875d-783b1e6c50a8"], "title": "Fast and scalable layer four switching", "venue": "acm special interest group on data communication", "year": 1998, "id": "38d55967-5a13-4d2f-b77f-49e54c113a08"}

{"abstract": "Abstract   The purpose of reverse engineering is to convert a large point cloud into an accurate, fair and consistent CAD model. The class of conventional engineering objects comprises, by a priori assumption, objects bounded only by simple, analytic surfaces, linear extrusion surfaces and surfaces of revolution. In this case it is possible to create a CAD model from point clouds with a minimal amount of user assistance. The key issue is segmentation, i.e. how to subdivide the point cloud into smaller regions, where each of which can be approximated by a single surface.  Segmentation is relatively simple, if regions are bounded by sharp edges and small blends; problems arise when smoothly connected regions need to be separated. The direct segmentation method described in this paper is based on a particular hierarchy of tests, by means of which a large point cloud can be robustly split into smaller and smaller subregions until no further subdivision is needed. Tests are given using different types of indicators. These are based on local estimates of various geometric and statistical quantities; several examples are given to show their effect.  The structure of the smooth, multiple regions obtained provides the basis for constrained surface fitting, which completes the final model building phase.", "authors": ["P\u00e1l Benk\u0151", "Tam\u00e1s V\u00e1rady"], "n_citation": 116, "references": ["0aba23e8-eb3a-4423-b3fb-c29e6f20fbfd", "0badf7be-7f89-40c4-b53a-8c4fc90f4247", "150019e0-a95c-4d83-8129-1d226fb10b4a", "2922ed4d-f075-4862-899b-9faf3e0a4d0e", "2c62cb01-08f1-4372-b363-0a9d857c5ef9", "4acad504-c36d-4c9b-9ea6-d1517babbddb", "6be0e896-9758-4ba5-9f90-266ccbb72614", "8e7518b7-8bfc-4ef2-81ad-7ffc73f3b016", "9a38e605-b175-4c1c-8e00-49ae7455ee32", "a5a48455-df28-43b7-be8c-6696ec2bf07a", "b5a678f9-adc7-431e-bf21-578d30f31c17", "d65b7704-8e46-41ed-9cac-2aec458ce837", "dbcdafef-ebca-4a4e-894a-f5d6ec2e1b07", "e0c0368a-4d69-4d70-8edb-a59090157e43", "e1e61c60-7f4a-4434-a76e-1f347bff3096"], "title": "Segmentation methods for smooth point regions of conventional engineering objects", "venue": "Computer-aided Design", "year": 2004, "id": "f1990c81-3d8c-4675-b527-1d0c64c86765"}

{"abstract": "This paper is focused on concurrent objects (objects shared by concurrent processes). It introduces a consistency condition called Normality whose definition is based only on local orders of operations as perceived by processes and by objects. First we consider the model in which each operation is on exactly one object. In this model we show that a history is linearizable iff it is normal. However, the definition of Normality is less constraining in the sense that there are strictly more legal sequential histories which are considered equivalent to the given history when Normality is used. We next consider a more general model where operations can span multiple objects. In this model we show that Normality is strictly weaker than Linearizability, i.e., history may be normal but not linearizable. As Normality refers only to local orders (process order and object order) it appears to be well-suited to objects supported by asynchronous distributed systems and accessed by RPC-like mechanisms.", "authors": ["Vijay K.

{"abstract": "Kernelization is a strong and widely-applied technique in parameterized complexity. A kernelization algorithm, or simply a kernel, is a polynomial-time transformation that transforms any given parameterized instance to an equivalent instance of the same problem, with size and parameter bounded by a function of the parameter in the input. A kernel is polynomial if the size and parameter of the output are polynomially-bounded by the parameter of the input. In this paper we develop a framework which allows showing that a wide range of FPT problems do not have polynomial kernels. Our evidence relies on hypothesis made in the classical world (i.e. non-parametric complexity), and revolves around a new type of algorithm for classical decision problems, called a distillation algorithm, which is of independent interest. Using the notion of distillation algorithms, we develop a generic lower-bound engine that allows us to show that a variety of FPT problems, fulfilling certain criteria, cannot have polynomial kernels unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses.

{"abstract": "The lingual barrier limits the ability of millions of non-English speaking developers to make effective use of the tremendous knowledge in Stack Overflow, which is archived in English. For cross-lingual question retrieval, one may use translation-based methods that first translate the non-English queries into English and then perform monolingual question retrieval in English. However, translation-based methods suffer from semantic deviation due to inappropriate translation, especially for domain-specific terms, and lexical gap between queries and questions that share few words in common. To overcome the above issues, we propose a novel cross-lingual question retrieval based on word embed-dings and convolutional neural network (CNN) which are the state-of-the-art deep learning techniques to capture word- and sentence-level semantics. The CNN model is trained with large amounts of examples from Stack Overflow duplicate questions and their corresponding translation by machine, which guides the CNN to learn to capture informative word and sentence features to recognize and quantify semantic similarity in the presence of semantic deviations and lexical gaps. A uniqueness of our approach is that the trained CNN can map documents in two languages (e.g., Chinese queries and English questions) in a dual-language vector space, and thus reduce the cross-lingual question retrieval problem to a simple k-nearest neighbors search problem in the dual-language vector space, where no query or question translation is required. Our evaluation shows that our approach significantly outperforms the translation-based method, and can be extended to dual-language documents retrieval from different sources.", "authors": ["Guibin Chen", "Chunyang Chen", "Zhenchang Xing", "Bowen Xu"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["050f3d56-45c0-4c32-86fb-db2fe9b5fb88", "0cb463f9-43f6-4918-b7df-9bf87ada902d", "10b1349c-b991-45fb-85b2-16a5b05731a6", "12603bc1-c652-4805-bac4-aa8acc209713", "12f40b38-cd99-4801-8074-d765a29a2101", "169b484b-5602-4ac8-8feb-dd67d315248d", "263ef9f2-6d22-49b7-8bca-277a8813764b", "297b1f52-365c-48ce-a846-033993e0760d", "2b89fa83-9486-4f1a-963a-303b2e1abdda", "4135bf74-f081-4d0e-8662-b372c0a6d84a", "47e20669-55b1-4e50-9ef2-e9f0496ce79a", "516b53c2-b26a-4f6c-a780-a69d98117142", "579b11c3-eeac-4d8c-8cff-49f5fcde80d6", "5a17d651-1cdd-430e-8ff5-233dc3541aae", "6a648a78-ba9c-4b06-82ef-92e58b625f60", "807e4a1c-e46c-4cca-a0e6-eb1605eddeba", "9e0e38c6-d358-40bd-8df3-dc4dda255d4c", "a28eb403-0e2d-4d79-be1e-cb7ba10edc41", "a87b8883-01de-40eb-be64-7c1049cd94f1", "b187cfc6-2da7-404a-b35b-55be10afec7f", "c186e8f6-42e1-4bb8-8fe3-039e0cd02532", "cda11c78-c6ed-47fc-a2ee-5959900f4a62", "d0da6f9f-2299-4684-98ae-0d74398791c5", "d34584d4-44fd-4172-a54b-ec903cbe1584", "d65d7e8b-7f8e-4428-a166-725e57ca0e47", "e2f7a74a-8430-4463-94ce-fe85dfd309f9", "e9abffef-c6bf-44da-a673-be480773dbbb", "eaed596c-14a2-425f-bc11-fc326384710c", "eb42ecfe-18ec-4987-9724-859ec4120b5c", "ee9bce8c-a802-45d1-9473-019972933648", "ef789fc0-c5ab-4ec9-a0ea-c441ffe90799", "f84276a3-af7c-4719-8297-0dc62d2c950c", "fbbe3725-f139-483c-80d3-bd015b133551"], "title": "Learning a dual-language vector space for domain-specific cross-lingual question retrieval", "venue": "automated software engineering", "year": 2016, "id": "36b1b7e5-792c-4746-97dc-aa9ec3dd8d43"}

{"abstract": "The reluctance of people to report bad news can be a major contributor to the phenomenon of runaway software projects. If senior managers receive bad news sooner, they may be able to prevent runaway software projects through corrective action. Two factors that are known to impact predisposition to report bad news are organizational climate (whether reporting bad news is likely to result in reward or punishment) and information asymmetry (whether hiding bad news is likely to be possible over time). Using matching experiments in an individualistic (United States) and a collectivistic culture (Singapore), this study investigates how the individualism-collectivism dimension of national culture may moderate the impact of organizational climate and information asymmetry on human predisposition to report bad news. The results revealed that individualism appeared to amplify the impact of organizational climate on predisposition to report bad news (compared to collectivism) whereas collectivism appeared to amplify the impact of information asymmetry on predisposition to report bad news (compared to individualism). When deciding on whether to report bad news about software projects, people from an individualistic culture seemed to be more sensitive to organizational climate whereas people from a collectivistic culture seemed to pay greater attention to information asymmetry. These results have useful implications for practice and research involving cross-cultural software project teams.

Although conditional compilation is powerful, it can be difficult to understand and is error-prone. In large software systems, file inclusion, conditional compilation and macro substitution are closely related and are often largely interleaved. Without adequate tools, understanding complex header files is a tedious task. This practice may even be complicated as the hierarchies of header files grow with projects. This paper presents our experiences of studying conditional compilation based on the symbolic execution of preprocessing directives. Our two concrete goals are: for any given preprocessor directive or C/C++ source code line, finding the simplest sufficient condition to reach/compile it, and finding the full condition to reach/compile that code line. Two different strategies were used to achieve these two goals.

{"abstract": "This paper introduces a dynamic model of the driver control strategy of lane-change behavior and applies it to trajectory planning in driver-assistance systems. The proposed model reflects the driver control strategies of adjusting longitudinal and latitudinal acceleration during the lane-change process and can represent different driving styles (such as slow and careful, as well as sudden and aggressive) by using different model parameters. We also analyze the features of the dynamic model and present the methods for computing the maximum latitudinal position and arrival time. Furthermore, we put forward an extended dynamic model to represent evasive lane-change behavior. Compared with the fifth-order polynomial lane-change model, the dynamic models fit actual lane-change trajectories better and can generate more accurate lane-change trajectories. We apply the dynamic models in emulating different lane-change strategies and planning lane-change trajectories for collision prediction. In the simulation, we use the models to compute the percentage of safe trajectories in different scenarios. The simulation shows that the maximum latitudinal position and arrival time of the generated lane-change trajectories can be good indicators of safe lane-change trajectories. In the field test, the dynamic models can generate the feasible lane-change trajectories and efficiently obtain the percentage of safe trajectories by computing the minimum gap and time to collision. The proposed dynamic model and module can be combined with the human-machine interface to help the driver easily identify safe lane-change trajectories and area.", "authors": ["Guoqing Xu", "Li Liu", "Yongsheng Ou", "Zhangjun Song"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["059416a9-9f63-4e67-b3cf-122b1e3a4abf", "20010bf5-c9af-4114-9e95-172ca6ed4def", "250a4393-a9f0-4ac7-85e9-839f86ae91d7", "31c56a83-bf1c-4af4-9f99-e6c2c3a4e86b", "77e345e7-65db-4885-ab2e-d636924e68b9", "7bc1336d-dd2b-4481-a8b7-a3d995b5b587", "95c6635e-6828-468b-883a-d4f4723e5a9c", "a562b7af-15ce-44e1-a65f-abb0daa9ce25", "b4bfbbc9-719c-4aba-8f1f-f9e121252f2f", "c7e3b27e-e74e-4aea-b4ee-0e5dc75eb35f", "dc00a4b8-2e9f-4324-b22e-10ee622fc788", "ddecca1f-adc1-429f-8295-c8a913b0ddd9", "e659d201-c4ca-4331-841b-ed5ddb81f301", "eb34331a-2de2-43f1-ae6c-082553516a0b"], "title": "Dynamic Modeling of Driver Control Strategy of Lane-Change Behavior and Trajectory Planning for Collision Prediction", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems", "year": 2012, "id": "60ac9934-d300-4f27-8b99-aadb43cdcd95"}
{"abstract": "In recent years, the inductive, incremental verification algorithm IC3 had a major impact on hardware model checking. Also with respect to software model checking, a number of adaptations of Boolean IC3 and combinations with CEGAR and ART-based techniques have been developed. However, most of them exploit the peculiarities of software programs, such as the explicit representation of control flow, only to a limited extent. In this paper, we propose a technique that supports this explicit representation in the form of control flow automata, and integrates it with symbolic reasoning about the data state space of the program. It thus provides a true lifting of IC3 from hardware to software model checking. By evaluating the approach on a number of case studies using a prototypical implementation, we demonstrate that our method shows promising results.", "authors": ["Tim Lange", "Martin R.

We demonstrate, through a series of examples, how this is achieved, and why it is important. These examples are elements of a prototype, Air Traffic Control simulator.

{"abstract": "We describe progress in completely automatically recovering 3D scene structure together with 3D camera positions from a sequence of images acquired by an unknown camera undergoing unknown movement. The main departure from previous structure from motion strategies is that processing is not sequential. Instead a hierarchical approach is employed building from image triplets and associated trifocal tensors. This is advantageous both in obtaining correspondences and also in optimally distributing error over the sequence. The major step forward is that closed sequences can now be dealt with easily. That is, sequences where part of a scene is revisited at a later stage in the sequence. Such sequences contain additional constraints, compared to open sequences, from which the reconstruction can now benefit. The computed cameras and structure are the backbone of a system to build texture mapped graphical models directly from image sequences.", "authors": ["Andrew W.

{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#Objective function-based fuzzy clustering aims at finding a fuzzy partition by optimizing a function that evaluates a (fuzzy) assignment of a given data set to clusters that are characterized by a set of parameters, the so-called prototypes. The iterative optimization technique usually requires the objective function not only to be differentiable, but prefers also an analytical solution for the equations of necessary conditions for local optima. Evolutionary algorithms are known to be an alternative robust optimization technique which is applicable to quite general forms of objective functions. We investigate the possibility of making use of evolutionary algorithms in fuzzy clustering. Our experiments and theoretical investigations show that the application of evolutionary algorithms to shell clustering, where the clusters are in the form of geometric contours, is not very promising due to the shape of the objective function, whereas they can be helpful in finding solid clusters that are not smooth, for example, rectangles or cubes. These types of clusters play an important role in fuzzy rule extraction from data. \u00a9 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "authors": ["Frank Klawonn", "Annette Keller"], "n_citation": 27, "title": "Fuzzy Clustering with Evolutionary Algorithms", "venue": "International Journal of Intelligent Systems", "year": 1998, "id": "b4aa0f47-adbc-4adc-9e10-cdc3546f4940"}

As most Automatic Fingerprint Recognition Systems are based on local ridge features known as minutiae, marking minutiae accurately and rejecting false ones is very important.

A critical step in automatic fingerprint matching is to reliably extract minutiae from the input fingerprint images.

{"abstract": "Metacomputing systems are intended to support remote and/or concurrent use of geographically distributed computational resources. Resource management in such systems is complicated by five concerns that do not typically arise in other situations: site autonomy and heterogeneous substrates at the resources, and application requirements for policy extensibility, co-allocation, and online control. We describe a resource management architecture that addresses these concerns. This architecture distributes the resource management problem among distinct local manager, resource broker, and resource co-allocator components and defines an extensible resource specification language to exchange information about requirements. We describe how these techniques have been implemented in the context of the Globus metacomputing toolkit and used to implement a variety of different resource management strategies. We report on our experiences applying our techniques in a large testbed, GUSTO, incorporating 15 sites, 330 computers, and 3600 processors.", "authors": ["Karl Czajkowski", "Ian T.

There are, however, inherent problems in two dimensional extensions to HMMs, one of which is the exponential complexity associated with fully 2-D HMMs. We propose a new 2-D HMM-like structure obtained by embedding states within regions of a deformable template structure. With this state-embedded deformable template (SEDT), each region of a deformable template has an underlying observation probability distribution.

{"abstract": "Providing packet-level quality of service (QoS) is critical to support both rate-sensitive and delay-sensitive applications in bandwidth-constrained, shared-channel, multihop wireless networks. Packet scheduling has been a very popular paradigm to ensure minimum throughput and bounded delay access for packet flows. This work describes a packet scheduling approach to QoS provisioning in multihop wireless networks. Besides minimum throughput and delay bounds for each flow, our scheduling disciplines seek to achieve fair and maximum allocation of the shared wireless channel bandwidth. However, these two criteria can potentially be in conflict in a generictopology multihop wireless network where a single logical channel is shared among multiple contending flows and spatial reuse of the channel bandwidth is possible. In this paper, we propose a new scheduling model that addresses this conflict. The main results of this paper are the following: (a) a two-tier service model that provides a minimum \"fair\" allocation of the channel bandwidth for each packet flow and additionally maximizes spatial reuse of bandwidth, (b) an ideal centralized packet scheduling algorithm that realizes the above service model, and (c) a practical distributed backoff-based channel contention mechanism that approximates the ideal service within the framework of the CSMA/CA protocol.", "authors": ["Haiyun Luo", "Songwu Lu", "Vaduvur Bharghavan", "Jerry Cheng", "Gary Zhong"], "n_citation": 91, "references": ["0dd76688-5c28-45e2-acae-ececbb352f82", "10f58ff9-c14e-4bf5-9c44-0a3f14626d3f", "1e6d582c-83c1-49f4-afdc-4aefb020c94d", "304bbbef-0187-441b-b832-67b4638d0308", "39445b90-3f40-476e-9738-2df253e68e43", "3959df04-cd82-45cb-8f82-8df2d2517b0c", "58a6263e-7a93-4e28-8980-0e061606c919", "6b0bc92b-9efa-4ef7-8772-c1e7d9c31a2a", "6ff3bae4-fe76-4a63-a42d-82c5d588eb67", "7966b1a7-c08a-4af7-9f00-0d4eee274215", "9ee02d48-6a1d-4a4a-bdd6-d73a416066e0", "a550b979-464e-4c8d-b81f-f70470b4937e", "b5b1c8b3-5ae9-43cd-a2d7-38bd99c6fd80", "c6484176-e0ab-4fa2-bb38-7fecaad66f48", "d515523f-a419-4f04-aed3-b3d909db139c", "d516becd-7bb6-4fea-a531-f9bc89ff377c", "d95c287f-d36d-4c25-9049-7b59b0c6e7a3", "dace033c-de16-4575-a79c-5ed116862c68"], "title": "A packet scheduling approach to QoS support in multihop wireless networks", "venue": "Mobile Networks and Applications", "year": 2004, "id": "a0b649b9-0ec0-4077-8b0b-fdf95c7ffc17"}

Over the years, many methods and techniques have been proposed to improve their elicitation, documentation, and validation. Knowing more about the state of the practice on these topics may benefit both practitioners' and researchers' daily work. A few empirical studies have been conducted in the past, but none under the perspective of software architects, in spite of the great influence that NFRs have on daily architects' practices. This paper presents some of the findings of an empirical study based on 13 interviews with software architects. It addresses questions such as: who decides the NFRs, what types of NFRs matter to architects, how are NFRs documented, and how are NFRs validated.

{"abstract": "A firm may want to preannounce its plans to develop a new product in order to stimulate future demand. But given that such communications can affect rivals' incentives to develop the same new product, a firm may decide to preannounce untruthfully in order to deter competitors. We examine an incumbent's preannouncement strategy when there is uncertainty regarding the commercial viability of a new product opportunity and a threat of rival entry. Each firm has a private assessment of the market potential for the new product. Two competitive incentives arise for the incumbent in terms of discouraging rival entry: it can use preemptive communication or it can remain silent and instill a pessimistic market potential outlook. We find that an incumbent prefers to follow a vaporware strategy---i.e., declares plans to pursue a new product opportunity even when it may have no development intentions---when its market forecasting capabilities are weak and the demand-side benefits from preannouncing are small. By contrast, when the incumbent has strong market forecasting capabilities and the demand-side benefits are small, the incumbent adopts a suddenware strategy---i.e., remains silent about its new product plans even when it actually plans to develop the new product. Finally, when its market forecasting capabilities are strong and the demand-side benefits are large, the incumbent prefers to engage in a trueware strategy---i.e., truthfully preannounces development plans. We show that an interplay between competition-related and demand-related considerations is what allows trueware to emerge as an equilibrium in the absence of any ex post cost to engaging in vaporware.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of efficiently migrating desktop virtual machines. The key challenge is to migrate the desktop VM quickly and in a bandwidth-efficient manner. The idea of replaying computation to reconstruct state seems appealing. However, our detailed analysis shows that the match between the source memory and the memory reconstructed via replay at the destination is poor, even at the subpage level; the ability to reconstruct memory state is stymied because modern OSes use address space layout randomization (ASLR) to improve security, and page prefetching to improve performance.#R##N##R##N#Despite these challenges, we show that desktop VM memory state can be efficiently compressed for transfer without relying on replay, using a suite of semantic techniques - collectively dubbed as MiG - that are tailored to the type of each memory page. Our evaluation on Windows and Linux desktop VMs shows that MiG is able to compress the VM state effectively, requiring on average 51-65% fewer bytes to be transferred during migration compared to standard compression, and halving the migration time in a typical setting.", "authors": ["Anshul Rai", "Ramachandran Ramjee", "Ashok Anand", "Venkata N.

{"abstract": "A group-buying market may offer multiple items with non-additive values (i.e., items may be complementary or substitutable), to buyers who are often heterogeneous in their item valuations. In such a situation, the formation of buying groups should concentrate buyers for common items while taking into consideration buyers' heterogeneous preferences over item bundles. Also, it should permit non-uniform cost sharing among buyers in the same group, which benefits all buyers by drawing more group-buying participants. We introduce the concept of Combinatorial Coalition Formation (CCF), which allows buyers to announce reserve prices for combinations of items. These reserve prices, along with the sellers' price-quantity curves for each item, are used to determine the formation of buying groups for each item. Moreover, buyers in the same group may not necessarily all pay the same price. The objective of CCF is to maximize buyers' total surplus. Determining the optimal coalition configuration in CCF is NP-hard, and the stability of such a configuration relies on the cost sharing rule within each group. We thus propose a heuristic algorithm for CCF based on augmented greedy selections, along with a cost sharing rule satisfying certain stability properties. Simulation results show that our approximate algorithm generates fairly good solutions compared to the optimal results, and is greatly superior to a simpler distributed approach. Furthermore, our algorithm's performance is enhanced when items are complementary or strongly substitutable, especially in settings when the prices decrease either rapidly or slowly with the quantities. Evaluations of the sellers' revenue under CCF demonstrate that sellers should offer a more gradually decreasing price-quantity curve for complementary or strongly substitutable items, and a more abruptly decreasing curve for weakly substitutable items. In addition, sellers may benefit from greater sales generated by simpler price-quantity curves with fewer steps.", "authors": ["Cuihong Li", "Katia P.

{"abstract": "With a huge amount of data stored in spatial databases and the introduction of spatial components to many relational or object-relational databases, it is important to study the methods for spatial data warehousing and OLAP of spatial data. In this paper, we study methods for spatial OLAP, by integrating nonspatial OLAP methods with spatial database implementation techniques. A spatial data warehouse model, which consists of both spatial and nonspatial dimensions and measures, is proposed. Methods for the computation of spatial data cubes and analytical processing on such spatial data cubes are studied, with several strategies being proposed, including approximation and selective materialization of the spatial objects resulting from spatial OLAP operations. The focus of our study is on a method for spatial cube construction, called object-based selective materialization, which is different from cuboid-based selective materialization (proposed in previous studies of nonspatial data cube construction). Rather than using a cuboid as an atomic structure during the selective materialization, we explore granularity on a much finer level: that of a single cell of a cuboid. Several algorithms are proposed for object-based selective materialization of spatial data cubes, and a performance study has demonstrated the effectiveness of these techniques.", "authors": ["Nebojsa Stefanovic", "Jiawei Han", "Krzysztof Koperski"], "n_citation": 243, "references": ["19286a56-b84b-44d2-8a16-7a1c94cd367c", "196803d1-e419-4897-9dc9-b760208c802e", "21cb1962-824d-4bc5-a2c9-db55ef0481bf", "34c2f9a5-a5be-46d7-b539-5e3cbfd4aab9", "45df0be8-96e4-4b53-a00b-3a774f72ab83", "5f79215b-40d5-4d63-a0e8-389c297af5dd", "87bd344a-9144-482b-9555-75da83534c87", "9f907f6a-f252-4f6b-8955-ff50970d31a8", "b62efe48-778e-464b-a070-01156f1814f3", "bdb8d83d-1771-4399-b593-d43be5a9f892", "d02f6aca-a2fe-46e2-a1f5-9e987531e5de", "d3c5fc62-2f5b-4ab2-a321-564ef9232643", "daa4e468-23b3-4a9a-9fb1-49b614003bed", "dd5ce97b-5453-4996-b003-c968955242c8", "ea6e92b8-95f9-4a46-946b-137d9aaa590d", "ee93ef28-8456-4d4b-b06f-06f2dfa92be2"], "title": "Object-based selective materialization for efficient implementation of spatial data cubes", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering", "year": 2000, "id": "bd30e409-676c-476d-aabd-7f500176b9d9"}

{"abstract": "Estimation of rigid body attitude and angular velocity without any knowledge of the attitude dynamics model is treated using the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle from variational mechanics. It is shown that Wahba's cost function for attitude determination from two or more non-collinear vector measurements can be generalized and represented as a Morse function of the attitude estimation error on the Lie group of rigid body rotations. With body-fixed sensor measurements of direction vectors and angular velocity, a Lagrangian is obtained as the difference between a kinetic energy-like term that is quadratic in the angular velocity estimation error and an artificial potential obtained from Wahba's function. An additional dissipation term that depends on the angular velocity estimation error is introduced, and the Lagrange-d'Alembert principle is applied to the Lagrangian with this dissipation. A Lyapunov analysis shows that the state estimation scheme so obtained provides stable asymptotic convergence of state estimates to actual states in the absence of measurement noise, with an almost global domain of attraction. These estimation schemes are discretized for computer implementation using discrete variational mechanics. A first order Lie group variational integrator is obtained as a discrete-time implementation. In the presence of bounded measurement noise, numerical simulations show that the estimated states converge to a bounded neighborhood of the actual states.", "authors": ["Maziar Izadi", "Amit K.

Place names commonly occur within lists and data tables, whose authors frequently omit qualifications (such as city or state containers) for place names because they expect the meaning of individual place names to be obvious from context. We present a novel technique for place name disambiguation (also known as toponym resolution) that uses Bayesian inference to assign categories to lists or tables containing place names, and then interprets individual toponyms based on the most likely category assignments. The categories are defined as nodes in hierarchies along three orthogonal dimensions: place types (e.g., cities, capitals, rivers, etc.), geographic containers, and prominence (e.g., based on population).", "authors": ["Marco D.

{"abstract": "In their seminal paper (ACM T. Softw. Eng.

Starting from the premise that the stakeholders of the system-to-be communicate to the software engineer the information needed to perform RE, Zave and Jackson's ontology is shown to be incomplete, in that it does not cover all classes of basic concerns - namely, the beliefs, desires, intentions, and evaluations - that the stakeholders communicate. In response, we provide a new core ontology for requirements that covers these classes of basic stakeholder concerns. The proposed new core ontology leads to a new formulation of the requirements problem. We thereby establish a new framework for the information that needs to be elicited over the course of RE and new criteria for determining whether an RE problem has been successfully addressed.", "authors": ["Ivan Jureta", "John Mylopoulos", "St\u00e9phane Faulkner"], "n_citation": 55, "references": ["003a6a94-09b7-402f-91b7-8c3397e9883c", "06e64e99-3717-4646-89e7-941a787fba79", "0e88cd26-64c1-4bf8-8add-e367c01d4c3a", "175e32fd-158b-495c-bbff-9562246edbc3", "2134bf3b-fd89-4724-90ce-5993b4fa3218", "3055a915-27aa-418d-afd4-e870c22b8ae4", "3b8d8731-2b70-4454-a354-6ed9485098e2", "4de0e8df-ff21-40db-9872-8fb48c1e6f80", "54ed110a-c887-4622-b85f-a1827366d2b6", "620150d0-8acf-467e-b69d-dd831c5b59c9", "69220232-821f-4e21-8d99-3decfb2f9da6", "6f433b0a-54e6-4b60-ac6c-08b1a8debb0d", "70782c64-be1e-4e35-8f30-8080f57205c9", "74e80fef-6e9a-4ff3-944c-12828878827d", "7d3726d8-21e5-4321-833d-dfde277c3693", "834cf2f0-08e2-49ac-98fb-ff4228665ab8", "85f9de82-c51e-4f2d-b403-5cdf517ebbc9", "99600c52-c29e-4944-984d-2bd1fedbe9c4", "9f3bdcc5-658d-4865-b856-f00b14c3460e", "a812a62d-305d-485d-b2d0-99da602cb219", "a9a6fdfe-1f22-4400-8216-03225373614b", "b1a4e18b-5634-4a43-b73c-77c1a687b22a", "ba6e7aa2-8961-41a9-afb2-56e233a4c420", "c79c9916-43b4-4fbb-867b-5af47fa33786", "c7f77a84-c069-4055-9c49-a4c4ba722f4d", "c9e8d201-dd9d-4625-9d2c-c366c2413670", "d1c02eba-6883-455c-a3df-91fae59c7d2e", "d2868ca3-9d82-461b-a325-fa046e10daff", "d63dd4ae-4b30-484b-8ffc-88d21839ddad", "e60f90d0-1a2f-4bc0-a483-7a5db48b0edd", "e850a30c-0089-4865-9184-14ec5c79d874", "fbb462b6-7db9-4e77-b99e-f5d540966a6c", "fe809832-a151-4f9b-9a44-15ffb1af21fb"], "title": "A core ontology for requirements", "venue": "Applied Ontology", "year": 2009, "id": "b0120fb5-19d3-48b0-a42c-24b0cdde07f2"}

Our algorithm achieves accurate noise detection and high SNR measures without smearing the fine details and edges in the image. The notion of homogeneity level is defined for pixel values based on their global and local statistical properties. The cooccurrence matrix technique is used to represent the correlations between a pixel and its neighbors, and to derive the upper and lower bound of the homogeneity level. Noise detection is performed at two stages: noise candidates are first selected using the homogeneity level, and then a refining process follows to eliminate false detections. The noise detection scheme does not use a quantitative decision measure, but uses qualitative structural information, and it is not subject to burdensome computations for optimization of the threshold values.

{"abstract": "Open source software systems are important components of many business software applications. Field defect predictions for open source software systems may allow organizations to make informed decisions regarding open source software components. In this paper, we remotely measure and analyze predictors (metrics available before release) mined from established data sources (the code repository and the request tracking system) as well as a novel source of data (mailing list archives) for nine releases of OpenBSD. First, we attempt to predict field defects by extending a software reliability model fitted to development defects. We find this approach to be infeasible, which motivates examining metrics-based field defect prediction. Then, we evaluate 139 predictors using established statistical methods: Kendall's rank correlation, Pearson's rank correlation, and forward AIC model selection. The metrics we collect include product metrics, development metrics, deployment and usage metrics, and software and hardware configurations metrics. We find the number of messages to the technical discussion mailing list during the development period (a deployment and usage metric captured from mailing list archives) to be the best predictor of field defects. Our work identifies predictors of field defects in commonly available data sources for open source software systems and is a step towards metrics-based field defect prediction for quantitatively-based decision making regarding open source software components", "authors": ["Paul Luo Li", "James D.

{"abstract": "Asynchronously communicating stochastic modules (SAM) are Petri nets that can be seen as a set of modules that communicate through buffers, so they are not (yet another) Petri net subclass, but they complement a net with a structured view. This paper considers the problem of exploiting the compositionality of the view to generate the state space and to find the steady-state probabilities of a stochastic extension of SAM in a net-driven, efficient way. Essentially we give an expression of an auxiliary matrix, G, which is a supermatrix of the infinitesimal generator of a SAM. G is a tensor algebra expression of matrices of the size of the components for which it is possible to numerically solve the characteristic steady-state solution equation /spl pi//spl middot/G=0, without the need to explicitly compute G. Therefore, we obtain a method that computes the steady-state solution of a SAM without ever explicitly computing and storing its infinitesimal generator, and therefore without computing and storing the reachability graph of the system.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of verifying correctness of finite state machines that communicate with each other over unbounded FIFO channels that are unreliable. Various problems of interest in verification of FIFO channels that can lose messages have been considered by Finkel and by Abdulla and Jonsson. We consider, in this paper, other possible unreliable behaviors of communication channels, viz., (a) duplication and (b) insertion errors. Furthermore, we also consider various combinations of duplication, insertion, and lossiness errors. Finite state machines that communicate over unbounded FIFO buffers are a model of computation that forms the backbone of the ISO standard protocol specification languages Estelle and SDL. While the assumption of a perfect communication medium is reasonable at the higher levels of the OSI protocol stack, the lower levels have to deal with an unreliable communication medium; hence our motivation for the present work. The verification problems that are of interest arereachability,unboundedness,deadlock, andmodel-checking against CTL*. All of these problems are undecidable for machines communicating over reliable unbounded FIFO channels. So it is perhaps surprising that some of these problems become decidable when unreliable channels are modeled. The contributions of this paper are (a) an investigation of solutions to these problems for machines with insertion errors, duplication errors, or a combination of duplication, insertion, and lossiness errors, and (b) a comparison of the relative expressive power of the various errors.", "authors": ["G\u00e9rard C\u00e9c\u00e9", "Alain Finkel", "S.

This representation is used for geometric surface matching to 3-D medical image data, such as from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The parameterization decomposes the surface into sinusoidal basis functions. Four types of surfaces are modeled: tori, open surfaces, closed surfaces and tubes. This parameterization allows a wide variety of smooth surfaces to be described with a small number of parameters. Extrinsic model-based information is incorporated by introducing prior probabilities on the parameters. Surface finding is formulated as an optimization problem.

{"abstract": "Modern robotics systems rely on distributed event-based frameworks to facilitate the assembly of software out of collections of reusable components. These frameworks express component dependencies in data that encode event publish-subscribe relations. This loosely coupled architecture makes it difficult for developers to understand the dependencies and to predict the impacts of a change to a component as the components grow in number and complexity. Moreover, this encoding of dependencies renders traditional techniques for analyzing component dependencies inapplicable, because the dependencies are bound by communication channels rather than data. In this work, we present a program analysis technique that automatically extracts a model of component dependencies from distributed system source code. This model identifies not only the temporal dependencies among components, but also the conditions under which those dependencies are realized. We have implemented the analysis and applied it to systems developed in ROS. The resulting models are succinct and precise, which suggests that programmers will find them comprehensible, and they can be used to document important global dependencies in a system, to compare different versions to identify the impacts of component changes, and to help locate errors.", "authors": ["Rahul Purandare", "Javier Darsie", "Sebastian G.

{"abstract": "Deniable authentication protocol is an authentication protocol that allows a sender to authenticate a message for a receiver, in a way that the receiver cannot convince a third party that such authentication ever took place. In recent years, due to the popularity of Internet and its special property, many deniable authentication protocols have been proposed. However, most of these proposed schemes are interactive and less efficient. To our knowledge, Shao has proposed an efficient non-interactive deniable authentication protocol based on generalized ElGamal signature scheme without security proof. Lu et al have proposed a deniable authentication also, however, the protocol suffers from the receiver's attack who once interacts with the sender. For the reason above, we would like to propose a generic method to construct efficient non-interactive deniable authentication protocols from any trapdoor permutations. Using RSA trapdoor permutations we introduce a new digital signature with tight security and use it to construct a concrete deniable authentication protocol. Concentrated on security problem we prove the protocol secure in random oracle.

{"abstract": "Supercavitating vehicles can achieve very high speed but also pose technical challenges in system stability, maneuvering, and control. Compared to a fully-wetted vehicle for which substantial lift is generated due to vortex shedding off the hull, a supercavitating vehicle is enveloped by gas surface (cavity) and thus the lift is provided by control surface deflections of the cavitator and fins, as well as planing force between the vehicle and the cavity. The nonlinearity in modeling of the cavitator, fins, and especially in modeling of the planing force makes the control design more difficult. In this paper, we investigate several nonlinear control design approaches such as sliding-mode control and quasi linear-parameter-varying control for the dive-plane dynamics of a supercavitating vehicle model. The stability and robustness of the final designs are analyzed. Since only a partial set of state variables are measurable, a high-gain observer is also designed to estimate state variables that are not directly available for feedback. Considering the physical limits of deflection angles of control surfaces of the cavitator and fins, we design a saturation compensator and activate it when needed. Then simulation results are presented for the (partial) output feedback controllers, which are combination of state-feedback nonlinear controllers and the high-gain observer.", "authors": ["Xiaofeng Mao", "Qian Wang"], "n_citation": 32, "references": ["8435adbc-5898-49a6-a017-955132822b2f", "966be636-04ed-4814-80d7-b3db553a9ed2", "967a144f-60bd-49b7-ac2f-9d2001dc48dd"], "title": "Nonlinear Control Design for a Supercavitating Vehicle", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Control Systems and Technology", "year": 2009, "id": "c7c0f4b3-1918-4744-b32a-a6228e021bf9"}

{"abstract": "Many current model reference adaptive control methods employ parametric adaptive elements in which the number of parameters are fixed a-priori and the hyperparameters, such as the bandwidth, are pre-defined, often through expert judgment. Typical examples include the commonly used Radial Basis Function (RBF) Neural Networks (NNs) with pre-allocated centers. As an alternative to these methods, a nonparametric model using Gaussian Processes (GPs) was recently proposed. Using GPs, it was shown that it is possible to maintain constant coverage over the operating domain by adaptively selecting new kernel locations without any previous domain knowledge. However, even if kernel locations provide good coverage of the input domain, incorrect bandwidth selection can result in poor characterization of the model uncertainty, leading to poor performance. In this paper, we propose methods for learning hyperparameters online in GP-MRAC by optimizing a modified likelihood function. We prove the stability and convergence of our algorithm in closed loop. Finally, we evaluate our methods in simulation on an example of wing rock dynamics. Results show learning hyperparameters online robustly reduces the steady state modeling error and improves control smoothness over other MRAC schemes.", "authors": ["Robert C.

{"abstract": "Various distributed optimization methods have been developed for solving problems which have simple local constraint sets and whose objective function is the sum of local cost functions of distributed agents in a network. Motivated by emerging applications in smart grid and distributed sparse regression, this paper studies distributed optimization methods for solving general problems which have a coupled global cost function and have inequality constraints. We consider a network scenario where each agent has no global knowledge and can access only its local mapping and constraint functions. To solve this problem in a distributed manner, we propose a consensus-based distributed primal-dual perturbation (PDP) algorithm. In the algorithm, agents employ the average consensus technique to estimate the global cost and constraint functions via exchanging messages with neighbors, and meanwhile use a local primal-dual perturbed subgradient method to approach a global optimum. The proposed PDP method not only can handle smooth inequality constraints but also non-smooth constraints such as some sparsity promoting constraints arising in sparse optimization. We prove that the proposed PDP algorithm converges to an optimal primal-dual solution of the original problem, under standard problem and network assumptions. Numerical results illustrating the performance of the proposed algorithm for a distributed demand response control problem in smart grid are also presented.", "authors": ["Tsung Hui Chang", "Angelia Nedic", "Anna Scaglione"], "n_citation": 99, "references": ["0018ed74-be27-461d-9d42-ae05ec0f8bd3", "09575f1a-49ea-4a79-8d35-f5cbd5125605", "13584995-f424-44c7-8d1a-f5de24798ffc", "25bfd3ea-40d0-4e0f-b97d-a4f153b292b7", "2735c627-4c9f-4b1d-9fab-9c2ce0a17e3b", "4014a440-363a-4a73-b102-de8c45f1b06b", "48d356c2-09ec-4d5d-a812-094c5f673ee4", "55ecabce-cb34-4516-966d-8c43ca7755b8", "733a1384-d9c1-482a-bacf-41fbc952f8b2", "73b7b6f0-1556-418e-8879-455de2764d04", "7c55fe22-6648-4e11-a6da-e39ceda2a529", "7f1bdbfa-6b3d-4c15-b3fd-4ca259be6e81", "88b34867-23c7-42fc-8478-017c1335b2f7", "96a49939-9657-42a2-928a-ae797bf2999e", "9b81a92d-3db3-421d-bf56-7a8f5fc30071", "9c7174a1-3c73-4a2e-a78b-b23816830420", "a065714f-f4d7-4683-84c2-2c0a1eb64c40", "ad27ce1c-0f2a-46ec-bae6-dd6c8e8fc0a9", "aeea730c-6d69-4563-a770-eca654d66b35", "b05e1263-c4f2-4afd-9559-101eccb42e6e", "b50dd298-be2e-4144-9a1b-a6ba67e9493c", "b6225086-0bfd-44aa-b269-70d0ad896a6d", "bacedd4e-2e09-4ec8-8d9a-0f77e1e3816f", "c74e5d58-1493-4fa8-a092-abc20c7c7fab", "d7b5aadf-ec30-4fb7-9224-7474169d3744", "dfbccce3-46cf-433c-b061-ce6f161a915a", "f0c0249b-4cef-436c-904f-1d70ef15d300", "fcbc7ddc-2e32-4105-a749-2876a31bb409", "fce85dc7-00e3-4e2b-96a1-6fde0ffb735e"], "title": "Distributed Constrained Optimization by Consensus-Based Primal-Dual Perturbation Method", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "year": 2014, "id": "c7748354-eb2c-42d3-9deb-fcbed0bc7504"}

We present a large-scale experimental comparison of logistic regression and tree induction, assessing classification accuracy and the quality of rankings based on class-membership probabilities. We use a learning-curve analysis to examine the relationship of these measures to the size of the training set. The results of the study show several things. (1) Contrary to some prior observations, logistic regression does not generally outperform tree induction. (2) More specifically, and not surprisingly, logistic regression is better for smaller training sets and tree induction for larger data sets. Importantly, this often holds for training sets drawn from the same domain (that is, the learning curves cross), so conclusions about induction-algorithm superiority on a given domain must be based on an analysis of the learning curves. (3) Contrary to conventional wisdom, tree induction is effective at producing probability-based rankings, although apparently comparatively less so for a given training-set size than at making classifications. Finally, (4) the domains on which tree induction and logistic regression are ultimately preferable can be characterized surprisingly well by a simple measure of the separability of signal from noise.", "authors": ["Claudia Perlich", "Foster Provost", "Jeffrey S.

{"abstract": "Objective: Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is the most common malignancy of childhood, representing nearly one third of all pediatric cancers. Currently, the treatment of pediatric ALL is centered on tailoring the intensity of the therapy applied to a patient's risk of relapse, which is linked to the type of leukemia the patient has. Hence, accurate and correct diagnosis of the various leukemia subtypes becomes an important first step in the treatment process. Recently, gene expression profiling using DNA microarrays has been shown to be a viable and accurate diagnostic tool to identify the known prognostically important ALL subtypes. Thus, there is currently a huge interest in developing autonomous classification systems for cancer diagnosis using gene expression data. This is to achieve an unbiased analysis of the data and also partly to handle the large amount of genetic information extracted from the DNA microarrays.Methodology: Generally, existing medical decision support systems (DSS) for cancer classification and diagnosis are based on traditional statistical methods such as Bayesian decision theory and machine learning models such as neural networks (NN) and support vector machine (SVM). Though high accuracies have been reported for these systems, they fall short on certain critical areas. These included (a) being able to present the extracted knowledge and explain the computed solutions to the users; (b) having a logical deduction process that is similar and intuitive to the human reasoning process; and (c) flexible enough to incorporate new knowledge without running the risk of eroding old but valid information. On the other hand, a neural fuzzy system, which is synthesized to emulate the human ability to learn and reason in the presence of imprecise and incomplete information, has the ability to overcome the above-mentioned shortcomings. However, existing neural fuzzy systems have their own limitations when used in the design and implementation of DSS. Hence, this paper proposed the use of a novel neural fuzzy system: the generic self-organising fuzzy neural network (GenSoFNN) with truth-value restriction (TVR) fuzzy inference, as a fuzzy DSS (denoted as GenSo-FDSS) for the classification of ALL subtypes using gene expression data.Results and conclusion: The performance of the GenSo-FDSS system is encouraging when benchmarked against those of NN, SVM and the K-nearest neighbor (K-NN) classifier. On average, a classification rate of above 90% has been achieved using the GenSo-FDSS system.", "authors": ["Whye Loon Tung", "Chai Quek"], "n_citation": 59, "references": ["17d92951-cd71-4945-b1c5-c9c558d92157", "21db7209-be84-47dc-809f-fcb19702c18f", "2bd9968a-1e0b-4a11-85a2-19edcf0ee77d", "335b9952-e3df-4e7e-8df7-c8c2cc15b5d5", "46eadbca-52d8-43f9-a1bc-d541b61b389d", "4d6c58da-7748-413b-aa45-09b1ca528c1a", "5c3f5ecb-781a-47c6-9c04-9a55c21961c2", "6bfa8795-f0d8-4f20-afe9-ad842c2fa6fc", "773a7288-ed7c-408b-a106-3d5d3e65cbd5", "7d8444f7-facf-42b6-a45e-2038a6ffcd43", "80cb67a5-0117-46f2-8553-671faa21f208", "84f0632b-1d50-4b99-82a6-7b5bbaeb3d4b", "884651b8-1e28-4e2c-8c16-e7ab8446138b", "a2e55d31-1103-4d9b-8b41-6f7e9733c1e2", "ad761d07-cd0f-4e88-a928-4cc8e5a7f0d7", "ade89ec4-36f3-4dff-ae47-7a0dac5c6299", "aeff130f-ddc0-4fc6-81af-2500833ec6dc", "b68a4050-7d52-407b-9167-a661c0a24c3c", "d1535ae8-17ae-451a-8700-284c3dd92f80", "dfbce6f6-d183-4b15-8557-f1ec4c76d7ba", "e0f3a738-4ab2-40d1-ba44-506d81c1d230", "ea10ae08-14d6-4b0d-afaf-9e2e28eb79f7"], "title": "GenSo-FDSS: a neural-fuzzy decision support system for pediatric ALL cancer subtype identification using gene expression data", "venue": "Artificial Intelligence in Medicine", "year": 2005, "id": "dc3fe5e1-f089-40d3-867a-307910075d36"}

The study has revealed weaknesses of design in semantic appropriateness and completeness of certain event operators, in flexibility of operator usage and timing specification, in the effectiveness and efficiency of expressions, and in readability of the languages. Based on the findings, we propose a new event language called SEL, which attempts to avoid some of these problems.

{"abstract": "We present a fast shared memory multiprocessor with uniform memory access time. A first prototype (SB-PRAM) is running with 4 processors, a 128 processor version is under construction. A second implementation (HPP) using latest VLSI technology and optical links shall run at a speed of 96 MHz. To achieve this speed, we first investigate the re-design of ASICs and network links. We then balance processor speed and memory bandwidth by investigating the relation between local computation and global memory access in several benchmark applications. On numerical codes such as linpack, 2 and 8 GFlop/s shall be possible with 128 and 512 processors, respectively, thus approaching processor performance of Intel Paragon XPS.

With the advent of the World Wide Web, the majority of the archive has been placed on-line as a science digital library for access by scientists, the educational community, and the general public. The meta-data in this archive, primarily collected to ensure that future scientists would be able to understand the context within which the science data was collected and archived, has enabled the development of sophisticated on-line interfaces. The success of this effort is primarily due to the development of a standards architecture based on a formal model of the planetary science domain. A peer review process for validating the meta-data and the science data has been critical in maintaining a consistent archive. In support of new digital library research initiatives, the PDS functions as a case study in the development and management of meta-data for science digital libraries.", "authors": ["J.

{"abstract": "Formal verification of arithmetic datapaths has been part of the estab- lished methodology for most Intel processor designs over the last years, usually in the role of supplementing more traditional coverage oriented testing activities. For the recent Intel Core TM i7 design we took a step further and used formal verification as the primary validation vehicle for the core execution cluster, the component responsible for the functional behaviour of all microinstructions. We applied symbolic simulation based formal verification techniques for full data- path, control and state validation for the cluster, and dropped coverage driven testing entirely. The project, involving some twenty person years of verification work, is one of the most ambitious formal verification efforts in the hardware industry to date. Our experiences show that under the right circumstances, full formal verification of a design component is a feasible, industrially viable and competitive validation approach.", "authors": ["Roope Kaivola", "Rajnish Ghughal", "Naren Narasimhan", "Amber Telfer", "Jesse Whittemore", "Sudhindra Pandav", "Anna Slobodov\u00e1", "Christopher Taylor", "Vladimir Frolov", "Erik Reeber", "Armaghan Naik"], "n_citation": 110, "references": ["09512e32-2003-40b3-b2d1-7c2dfc56c7c6", "1c3acfa5-2180-4015-8411-e42bf3eb5b82", "1eab32ce-155e-4e74-bf72-3e9ec68d0c1a", "2cb9280c-6479-4242-bc30-61ad2b345c10", "384075e3-88e4-4508-8220-f28174cfe695", "3c4922f8-2cf8-465d-a19b-7484d34c53a2", "49cdaf5a-87e1-4d37-9b1c-e9ca57261f02", "4f42d991-7db5-4cf3-b20c-3f2fa45ed7f7", "8b35fe24-a60d-41a6-9b7f-77b5c479bbf3", "be0e7438-7552-4775-8c90-55452b13f1cb", "bf70d388-82d0-4d55-af08-b13ffdfdbb6f", "fd17cbf1-b326-4f7c-a816-2a082c67d8f5"], "title": "Replacing Testing with Formal Verification in Intel CoreTM i7 Processor Execution Engine Validation.", "venue": "computer aided verification", "year": 2009, "id": "4c4b48d9-82dc-4f25-b1c2-3c32025b1c98"}

Many results have been reported using a variety of approaches and techniques.

The purpose of this article is to survey the recent results developed to analyse the asymptotic stability of time-delay systems.

We consider a very general setting which includes, as special cases, distributed bandwidth management in communication networks, as well as variations of classical problems in distributed computing and communication networking such as deadlock: resolution and \"dining philosophers\". In the current paper, we exhibit first local solutions with globally-optimum performance guarantees. An application of our method is distributed bandwidth management in communication networks. In this setting, deadlock resolution (and maximum fractional independent set) corresponds to admission control maximizing network throughput. Job scheduling (and minimum fractional coloring) corresponds to route selection that minimizes load. >", "authors": ["Baruch Awerbuch", "Yossi Azar"], "n_citation": 80, "references": ["0eecca15-260e-458c-aa1a-71416e35f10f", "1102ac21-949b-4f5c-bfd9-7bb1fa5b8539", "3f2264f9-7bbb-4912-9ee6-88b1f58e484f", "495df24a-7e89-4630-bd1f-247527e76ec8", "68ae96c7-cd93-45cd-8c46-ead35f425d30", "767cadd7-c155-4e90-b575-0fca56a862f2", "7cdc9317-9fdc-40b7-ae8c-e8b36196e14b", "849579be-726f-46eb-9877-fb3736f2d218", "870c7690-32f2-4815-8a45-a04f1471eb21", "8728d141-57f5-46e9-8292-45a8019fe4ce", "8bd90200-a804-41c5-b239-fd167bdbaf85", "935a2633-715f-4d03-9079-cdc3015df579", "95a24d6c-f37d-44d3-8a03-0d49798052df", "9f882930-a11b-4db7-acc8-2f13a12ac246", "bcfeec21-3a64-4fb5-9a86-d917777cec50", "c150f791-1014-4732-b499-363e9e5ef77d", "c850974f-9734-43b4-85fb-f23c7914dd3f", "caf88b20-5b26-4976-a7f2-dcb46d03d2e9", "d27a6ec2-bde4-4155-862e-2e4dc992ea9e", "d95a936d-166d-491c-bd93-d3f82791ddb4", "ea8ed18b-ea3c-467e-aa1a-ee8e2e808b09"], "title": "Local optimization of global objectives: competitive distributed deadlock resolution and resource allocation", "venue": "foundations of computer science", "year": 1994, "id": "fb1ac47a-ce54-41f3-93c1-5202408e52bd"}

{"abstract": "Memory bugs in C/C++ programs severely affect system availability and security. This paper presents First-Aid, a lightweight runtime system that survives software failures caused by common memory management bugs and prevents future failures by the same bugs during production runs. Upon a failure, First-Aid diagnoses the bug type and identifies the memory objects that trigger the bug. To do so, it rolls back the programto previous checkpoints and uses two types of environmental changes that can prevent or expose memory bug manifestation during re-execution. Based on the diagnosis, First-Aid generates and applies runtime patches to avoid the memory bug and prevent its reoccurrence. Furthermore, First-Aid validates the consistent effects of the runtime patches and generates on-site diagnostic reports to assist developers in fixing the bugs.   We have implemented First-Aid on Linux and evaluated it with seven applications that contain various types of memory bugs, including buffer overflow, uninitialized read, dangling pointer read/write, and double free. The results show that First-Aid can quickly diagnose the tested bugs and recover applications from failures (in 0.084 to 3.978 seconds). The results also show that the runtime patches generated by First-Aid can prevent future failures caused by the diagnosed bugs. Additionally, First-Aid provides detailed diagnostic information on both the root cause and the manifestation of the bugs. Furthermore, First-Aid incurs low overhead (0.4-11.6% with an average of 3.7%) during normal execution for the tested buggy applications, SPEC INT2000, and four allocation intensive programs.", "authors": ["Qi Gao", "Wenbin Zhang", "Yan Tang", "Feng Qin"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0abf39d4-3e1f-4f9c-af3e-496278cfa17b", "167a4b00-c2bb-489d-86f1-ab3831833516", "1fa9751a-1578-430a-96b2-e513439ec70a", "2d2c49e5-99ac-462b-842e-6143a49f61cd", "308d5af9-fcd6-4645-b834-4a3148de4700", "492f0342-b3d9-4a6c-81a9-43af2bedecd2", "5511b151-927c-4a7b-aaa3-9eff626512d3", "5585a775-d0a3-4f1c-adfe-837a4a626c10", "5aa9499d-836a-4b54-9db7-f67a6d849dfa", "5d2d494f-3967-446a-8fb6-340383c0d8e3", "701abeac-7889-4518-ae13-b513e03aea22", "735dedeb-a935-4e6e-b071-4f7e3edfebb8", "824bdcf9-0415-4d86-b93f-3789fd2d053c", "89fe661e-83a3-4fd1-83db-075620e034a8", "9787425d-94d5-4529-8eb2-c904dd57ce69", "97ebf0f4-da9d-4739-88f2-265b128897f0", "a6293eac-ef57-48c4-9c63-b3230198988a", "a6300585-9ea0-4122-9b19-1bc42af9bde0", "b3216add-deff-4621-946a-a57c8b4ce640", "bb0ee0b4-1b75-4972-83c5-4f12bfbc2a56", "ca491598-3541-48e9-a56a-7a1506d1f7a0", "cc76cc26-3128-44a3-8c50-d692b9031790", "cf9bfe28-f036-446b-b8d2-6a7017babaa1", "d8a581f7-35db-4820-925a-dd1191122faf", "dc9b5e57-3f4a-41f2-a150-c1cc26fb4400", "dd60ab27-3d87-447e-a95e-f36ac1970ab0", "e2705eba-32c3-4bb7-9836-3fe64d77b8cb", "e925fcd3-9b21-497d-bf9b-313d70d94462", "ebf41a8a-bb4a-4baf-990d-c743e6d524e8"], "title": "First-aid: surviving and preventing memory management bugs during production runs", "venue": "european conference on computer systems", "year": 2009, "id": "aa59af23-b2b0-484e-9788-9274d6e8c4bf"}

To do so, we propose an agent-based distributed information processing system (ADIPS) as a design model of flexible distributed systems.

The reference to be tracked is given by a sum of a constant and a fixed number of sinusoidal signals, and it is assumed not to be available to the controller. This represents a possible situation in which the controller is required to synchronize the vehicle motion with that of an oscillating platform, such as the deck of a ship in high seas.

Due to outsourcing and the increasing need for companies to work together to meet their joint customer demands, there is a need for monitoring of business processes across organizational boundaries. Thereby, partners in a choreography have to exchange monitoring data, in order to enable process tracking and evaluation of process metrics. In this paper, we describe an event-based monitoring approach based on BPEL4Chor service choreography descriptions. We show how to define monitoring agreements specifying events each partner in the choreography has to provide.

{"abstract": "This paper reports empirical evidence that a neural network model is applicable to the prediction of foreign exchange rates. Time series data and technical indicators, such as moving average, are fed to neural networks to capture the underlying \u2018rulesa of the movement in currency exchange rates. The exchange rates between American Dollar and \"ve other major currencies, Japanese Yen, Deutsch Mark, British Pound, Swiss Franc and Australian Dollar are forecast by the trained neural networks. The traditional rescaled range analysis is used to test the \u2018e$ciencya of each market before using historical data to train the neural networks. The results presented here show that without the use of extensive market data or knowledge, useful prediction can be made and signi\"cant paper pro\"ts can be achieved for out-of-sample data with simple technical indicators. A further research on exchange rates between Swiss Franc and American Dollar is also conducted. However, the experiments show that with e$cient market it is not easy to make pro\"ts using technical indicators or time series input neural networks.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a cooperative distributed approach for searching odor sources in unknown structured environments with multiple mobile robots. While searching and exploring the environment, the robots independently generate on-line local topological maps and by sharing them with each other they construct a global map. The proposed method is a decentralized frontier based algorithm enhanced by a cost/utility evaluation function that considers the odor concentration and airflow at each frontier. Therefore, frontiers with higher probability of containing an odor source will be searched and explored first. The method also improves path planning of the robots for the exploration process by presenting a priority policy. Since there is no global positioning system and each robot has its own coordinate reference system for its localization, this paper uses topological graph matching techniques for map merging. The proposed method was tested in both simulation and real world environments with different number of robots and different scenarios. The search time, exploration time, complexity of the environment and number of double-visited map nodes were investigated in the tests. The experimental results validate the functionality of the method in different configurations.", "authors": ["Ali Marjovi", "Lino Marques"], "n_citation": 51, "references": ["02c21204-f8bb-44b0-b1c7-09fe4b7bb5fa", "054d3367-3367-4859-98de-6e7e206cf05a", "0ba2f7ea-c877-4a16-ba16-f800dca58346", "1e5a87d9-c0bc-4238-9bc1-dccda9b7f28a", "24b0d199-e9eb-4160-bded-3a8f456ed094", "3204300a-6464-4067-95ea-1fdef64396f7", "36d9b16f-0417-49e7-9ecb-4ada90b59772", "3b4ad873-93f5-40c6-ae55-d35e4d035414", "52a3a215-f07f-4e70-a55d-bb388e1c9648", "631ab96c-1268-448a-93b2-08578d9bf92b", "70f3fd4e-db76-4877-bdd6-c870a2d709ed", "8084cc37-f6c9-4670-8a96-4d2b795a3c15", "8105876a-79b0-4e23-9e70-a454a6dc4757", "8544d782-5a7e-40f3-a429-63bcfe2a6a77", "8c44d31e-17a9-4304-9217-43b8821579e3", "9125b0f1-5812-40d5-b033-f2ef2ff062b8", "9c1949a5-34e8-43c6-8bde-361df3781a4f", "9df8c381-75cd-4e79-8909-26781ba2da82", "b4376c07-f143-4523-8d72-a05227a28615", "bdcda518-5105-45a5-8f56-4e16187b3a2b", "d5138a85-c090-4728-8ef8-d324a9a30ba6", "e4b775bb-c6de-415a-8313-4dde36aee1b3", "ed9ca3a5-4082-4b19-baef-d21dcfdba711", "f5af556d-ace1-4ed1-a470-20096035fb85", "fbab2500-7cba-46c0-b370-8c3ba938b950", "fcc16c2f-f4fe-4b3d-a48b-35be578cebf3"], "title": "Multi-robot olfactory search in structured environments", "venue": "Robotics and Autonomous Systems", "year": 2011, "id": "aff88481-2eff-4bd5-ac86-499780ab8daa"}
{"abstract": "When a program violates its specification a model checker produces a counterexample that shows an example of undesirable behavior. It is up to the user to understand the error, locate it, and fix the problem. Previous work introduced a technique for explaining and localizing errors based on finding the closest execution to a counterexample, with respect to a distance metric. That approach was applied only to concrete executions of programs. This paper extends and generalizes the approach by combining it with predicate abstraction. Using an abstract state-space increases scalability and makes explanations more informative. Differences between executions are presented in terms of predicates derived from the specification and program, rather than specific changes to variable values. Reasoning to the cause of an error from the factthat in the failing run x  automatically generalized    Predicate abstraction has previously been used in model checking purely as a state-space reduction technique.

{"abstract": "Abstract   This paper presents a new perspective on the traditional AI task of problem solving and the techniques of abstraction and refinement. The new perspective is based on the well-known, but little exploited, relation between problem solving and the task of finding a path in a graph between two given nodes. The graph oriented view of abstraction suggests two new families of abstraction techniques, algebraic abstraction and STAR abstraction. The first is shown to be extremely sensitive to the exact manner in which problems are represented. STAR abstraction, by contrast, is very widely applicable and leads to significant speedup in all our experiments. The reformulation of traditional refinement techniques as graph algorithms suggests several enhancements, including an optimal refinement algorithm, and one radically new technique:  alternating search direction . Experiments comparing these techniques on a variety of problems show that  alternating opportunism  (AltO) a variant of the new technique, is uniformly superior to all the others.", "authors": ["Robert C.

{"abstract": "Deliberate injection of faults into cryptographic devices is an effective cryptanalysis technique against symmetric and asymmetric encryption algorithms. In this paper we will describe parity code based concurrent error detection (CED) approach against such attacks in substitution-permutation network (SPN) symmetric block ciphers [22]. The basic idea compares a carefully modified parity of the input plain text with that of the output cipher text resulting in a simple CED circuitry. An analysis of the SPN symmetric block ciphers reveals that on one hand, permutation of the round outputs does not alter the parity from its input to its output. On the other hand, exclusive-or with the round key and the non-linear substitution function (s-box) modify the parity from their inputs to their outputs. In order to change the parity of the inputs into the parity of outputs of an SPN encryption, we exclusive-or the parity of the SPN round function output with the parity of the round key. We also add to all s-boxes an additional 1-bit binary function that implements the combined parity of the inputs and outputs to the s-box for all its (input, output) pairs. These two modifications are used only by the CED circuitry and do not impact the SPN encryption or decryption. The proposed CED approach is demonstrated on a 16-input, 16-output SPN symmetric block cipher from [1].", "authors": ["Ramesh Karri", "Grigori Kuznetsov", "Michael Goessel"], "n_citation": 103, "references": ["0269ee73-7848-4b20-a4b2-c0740e0f35b0", "37b62447-897f-4b9c-9d3e-48a9d7cbc38b", "57673927-7630-4be9-a12a-9ade5f877d99", "584c2dbe-68fc-413c-b8b1-f74aeeb76656", "5bd2775f-c451-4f30-a5d4-e20776a5bf2a", "61b0180d-c27b-47c1-ae16-f61dda6e7162", "6cb7cca0-cacf-4cda-a347-93abcb4277ac", "93f9997c-9078-4c92-9b8e-5d1257ab7e05", "98ebef77-1ee3-4fbe-90ea-bd3b16a8009c", "ac8a6aa1-8dcb-43bb-8703-f9331b193573", "b3f223ba-78d7-4409-aba6-0c89d10b72af", "c527c31a-663f-43e2-ba0d-82cb11a07f4d", "d9e8f3a9-397f-4c28-8c60-a653a596ab2d", "f9f4d6e6-a830-4fe3-b7d1-36f6e700ed17"], "title": "Parity-Based Concurrent Error Detection of Substitution-Permutation Network Block Ciphers", "venue": "cryptographic hardware and embedded systems", "year": 2003, "id": "ce299141-94e7-4791-a7fa-7c7774ea4b67"}
{"abstract": "The clustering Algorithm is a kind of key technique used to reduce energy consumption. It can increase the scalability and lifetime of the network. Energy-efficient clustering protocols should be designed for the characteristic of heterogeneous wireless sensor networks. We propose and evaluate a new distributed energy-efficient clustering scheme for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks, which is called DEEC. In DEEC, the cluster-heads are elected by a probability based on the ratio between residual energy of each node and the average energy of the network. The epochs of being cluster-heads for nodes are different according to their initial and residual energy. The nodes with high initial and residual energy will have more chances to be the cluster-heads than the nodes with low energy. Finally, the simulation results show that DEEC achieves longer lifetime and more effective messages than current important clustering protocols in heterogeneous environments.", "authors": ["Li Qing", "Qingxin Zhu", "Mingwen Wang"], "n_citation": 163, "references": ["1ee4b656-7d2c-45e8-b2e8-b5633b992eeb", "23dd7fc0-1ebd-43ce-ab3e-43896512c209", "2af582ae-3859-442b-bf40-dfd44cb5f712", "38187041-3364-406b-a1f8-d6bd141263df", "5635caa6-be37-4788-9bf3-f68296f7da95", "623a642f-1245-4ff5-8d85-ced5ea24f924", "9e063b41-0ada-4db8-8846-6e5153a0de55", "a3491bc0-d5b1-4314-81e8-79e54b461bf8", "d92763d7-2ac9-4e03-89af-bd7f06ded78d", "dafffde2-2a18-418c-b638-fe55b76e7a62", "efdb41f4-8edc-48b0-870e-ea9343a7c08d"], "title": "Design of a distributed energy-efficient clustering algorithm for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks", "venue": "Computer Communications", "year": 2006, "id": "4e7a4db4-8904-4eba-870b-d8c743eeaf57"}

Practical experiments on a control-flow analysis of the ambient calculus show that the solver frequently performs better than the worst-case complexity estimates.", "authors": ["Flemming Nielson", "Hanne Riis Nielson", "Helmut Seidl"], "n_citation": 88, "references": ["01c6379b-d54f-499c-9dee-8c34eb15ad03", "02f19d46-a5b0-44df-85b2-da859e86d886", "08e3a4e2-14ac-4e35-b4b4-e1c144f8ef4e", "209d2428-157e-4559-b293-d3d2b137834c", "23c82e3b-76e3-401a-835b-7b7cc9e708c0", "5dff42ad-e16b-4b6a-bce3-fe808d109177", "635e2014-6579-4acf-9737-49593bc74701", "85bf4746-42d4-4c11-87c4-5fe18ed3a0a2", "984dff48-d954-4e1a-926e-338cdc0976da", "9a4984f9-27d4-47eb-8bc8-0469bf540f94", "9e42f7ec-fc54-43f7-9c42-7e006ed9f821", "b0121e2b-3f27-4024-80f4-d245f3e0bbaf", "b76160ce-757a-44ae-966b-c08be91b4706", "c7a6a60b-7f92-4515-9efa-a3563108eaf5", "dc5078e8-3501-41fa-b95b-73f2c5e61f5d", "e4a2c293-6276-4fbd-ac6e-406ad2e028d8", "ed09bc4e-c2b3-4267-a31e-a8108d5f0a92", "ee7f54ea-d2e1-45c9-ae66-3a1f8d4deff2"], "title": "A succinct solver for ALFP", "venue": "Nordic Journal of Computing", "year": 2002, "id": "0ad0f796-f6a7-47b5-8b41-2aa595a4963d"}
{"abstract": "Case-based reasoning involves reasoning from cases: specific pieces of experience, the reasoner's or another's, that can be used to solve problems. We use the term graph-structured for representations that (1) are capable of expressing the relations between any two objects in a case, (2) allow the set of relations used to vary from case to case, and (3) allow the set of possible relations to be expanded as necessary to describe new cases. Such representations can be implemented as, for example, semantic networks or lists of concrete propositions in some logic. We believe that graph-structured representations offer significant advantages, and thus we are investigating ways to implement such representations efficiently. We make a case-based argument using examples from two systems, CHIRON and CAPER, to show how a graph-structured representation supports two different kinds of case-based planning in two different domains. We discuss the costs associated with graph-structured representations and describe an approach to reducing those costs, implemented in CAPER.", "authors": ["Kathryn E. Sanders", "Brian P.

{"abstract": "Abstract   We address the problem of formalizing the evolution of a database under the effect of an arbitrary sequence of update transactions. We do so by appealing to a first-order representation language called the situation calculus, which is a standard approach in artificial intelligence to the formalization of planning problems. We formalize database transactions in exactly the same way as actions in the artificial intelligence planning domain. This leads to a database version of the frame problem in artificial intelligence. We provide a solution to the frame problem for a special, but substantial, class of update transactions. Using the axioms corresponding to this solution, we provide procedures for determining whether a given sequence of update transactions is legal, and for query evaluation in an updated database. These procedures have the desirable property that they appeal to theorem-proving only with respect to the initial database state.  We next address the problem of proving properties true in all states of the database. It turns out that mathematical induction is required for this task, and we formulate a number of suitable induction principles. Among those properties of database states that we wish to prove are the standard database notions of static and dynamic integrity constraints. In our setting, these emerge as inductive entailments of the database.  Finally, we discuss various possible extensions of the approach of this paper, including transaction logs and historical queries, the complexity of query evaluation, actualized transactions, logic programming approaches to updates, database views, and state constraints.", "authors": ["Raymond Reiter"], "n_citation": 112, "references": ["0b89d1b7-2551-4206-ae03-09b504fe9edf", "0ca394cb-09c9-434e-9b1b-648af6ce34c0", "105dc98b-ef8b-4368-8d66-c79d4316d8c2", "21f83041-72f5-4e21-bff3-b9e4742194e5", "244fb74d-0c8a-4d55-b5f0-dec8dd3f62ea", "249138c6-7348-44ca-b8bd-bfbd8ab714a4", "2c4764ba-5807-4f9d-bd1d-01f94c2c3be7", "360a1395-9457-46e9-a460-4e87406ad8ad", "3f662242-e867-4400-94ff-03133581ffeb", "515d7bfd-fd7f-47d4-b42c-47269cc460e2", "53039add-83b0-4261-a63d-e4d745a1c7b1", "6e31fccd-270f-4c10-88c7-fdc789402ff1", "8d83481d-8b17-4a14-90e3-5b29b56b6a51", "8d9d97d8-d45a-42cc-b7dc-43184634d63e", "a1ca4cd3-19e1-46a2-80bd-574b89c015ba", "a2c8c0e9-2d87-44d4-924d-6198027f6485", "a7335c3c-cf90-4187-a2e4-06e853fbb269", "b3a28152-322e-4a1d-a60b-79497e220572", "b3a6f742-8207-4274-b7d6-cdbefa3e8938", "b4b62b38-f117-4f00-8e18-3e841c4c3858", "d1e6db68-d3cc-404b-9085-84eaf37b730b", "d3041a6e-873a-4b86-b33a-afee74e2c5b9", "d979841a-b2ca-42bf-a39d-99c30c62fd20", "de06e2bd-22b2-4998-b439-e1bff2c23ff4", "e29b2f44-346e-44a5-8b3c-1818c06aa74e", "eb4b7d82-30b5-4c14-a2f8-896fbf97af9b"], "title": "On specifying database updates", "venue": "Journal of Logic Programming", "year": 1995, "id": "5463cd33-7c52-43c2-9aaf-cbef43b33127"}
{"abstract": "The artifacts constituting a software system are sometimes unnecessarily coupled with one another or may drift over time.

Numerical taxonomy is mathematically simple and yet it is a useful mechanism for component clustering and software partitioning. The technique can be applied at various levels of abstraction or to different software life-cycle phases. We have applied the technique to: (1) software partitioning at the software architecture design phase; (2) grouping of components based on the source code to recover the software architecture in the reverse engineering process; (3) restructuring of a software to support evolution in the maintenance stage; and (4) improving cohesion and reducing coupling for source code.

{"abstract": "To isolate and fix failures that occur in the field, after deployment, developers must be able to reproduce and investigate such failures in-house. In practice, however, bug reports rarely provide enough information to recreate field failures, thus making in-house debugging an arduous task. This task becomes even more challenging for programs whose input must adhere to a formal specification, such as a grammar. To help developers address this issue, we propose an approach for automatically generating inputs that recreate field failures in-house. Given a faulty program and a field failure for this program, our approach exploits the potential of grammar-guided genetic programming to iteratively find legal inputs that can trigger the observed failure using a limited amount of runtime data collected in the field. When applied to 11 failures of 5 real-world programs, our approach was able to reproduce all but one of the failures while imposing a limited amount of overhead.", "authors": ["Fitsum Meshesha Kifetew", "Wei Jin", "Roberto Tiella", "Alessandro Orso", "Paolo Tonella"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["06a0ca5c-cef2-4398-b5c2-a01b3d2a43ca", "13c57286-b6b5-4beb-8547-dfb7d1cf40a5", "148b67e3-da2b-472f-b259-216733ea669d", "19681919-30f2-46ee-af6d-4bd23c4514ec", "1a943cdb-eeba-4cf4-b756-f08f1ec83f97", "21b688ef-1dbc-41ee-b7a9-686455c9795b", "27523d98-2c73-4fd9-bcbb-4d118966dc44", "2d59ab71-d662-41b7-8ee6-62abcd5d287a", "2ebe9c60-718e-40d6-b7e0-8b5bb2eeb0af", "3ad0693d-69cc-415a-81ae-283d89696a63", "3e905beb-afd3-457d-a865-bf0755b59f72", "4056eb66-b7f6-49c0-b945-3a8ad61f300e", "4f4473f7-cf34-4bc3-bb3e-fe959233aca2", "588bb249-47ea-45e5-9c32-12059ce2585b", "6c08d0ff-5a0b-4bb6-886d-de2e7a1cfc8a", "71c47dd0-a7ff-4b97-a640-1186dd9ac968", "8c9d0706-cd82-45d5-ad51-5a7e4dc6e60d", "a6d3665e-3788-4c6f-9450-f0e594f8152b", "b880cbae-2030-406f-9dd0-593a0cbabbc3", "c6900187-d1d2-4d91-a98d-f6dbc82b3b4f", "d8ab6b10-bed8-4f5d-8a4c-21a3432797a9", "da99ced0-1e9c-442c-8af0-d4c6952fd6ae", "dedf1f56-0e5c-4dc4-b0f0-8d822a986471", "e63751ac-01a8-4314-aa4e-065f84b7c6c1", "e674d1cd-ffbc-420e-8abc-30853bfb10ff", "e9ef683e-6fa9-435c-907c-66b47c75f8fa", "ea566275-b87e-48c4-9257-1abde04a2f57", "ed64f8ec-a248-40bf-92b0-01e4937d2ab9", "fdf1404d-8e94-489d-a8dc-d9a46f41a742"], "title": "Reproducing Field Failures for Programs with Complex Grammar-Based Input", "venue": "international conference on software testing verification and validation", "year": 2014, "id": "bf6fee36-499e-470a-b353-24968127ff69"}

We derive bounds on the number of runs needed for the uniform convergence of the empirical average to the expected reward for a class of policies, in terms of the Vapnik-Chervonenkis or P-dimension of the policy class. Further, we show through a counterexample that whether we get uniform convergence or not for an MDP depends on the simulation method used. Uniform convergence results are also obtained for the average-reward case, for partially observed Markov decision processes, and can be easily extended to Markov games.

{"abstract": "Learning second and subsequent programming languages is easier than learning a first programming language because many concepts and constructs are shared. However, it is still a hard task. In this protocol analysis of moderately experienced programmers transferring to a new programming language, we classified episodes by whether they involved the syntactic, semantic, or planning level of programming knowledge. We discovered that most episodes involve planning and that in solving a given subproblem there are typically many cycles of language\u2010independent tactical planning followed by language\u2010dependent implementation planning.

{"abstract": "Energy storage - in the form of UPS units - in a datacenter has been primarily used to fail-over to diesel generators upon power outages. There has been recent interest in using these Energy Storage Devices (ESDs) for demand-response (DR) to either shift peak demand away from high tariff periods, or to shave demand allowing aggressive under-provisioning of the power infrastructure. All such prior work has only considered a single/specific type of ESD (typically re-chargeable lead-acid batteries), and has only employed them at a single level of the power delivery network. Continuing technological advances have provided us a plethora of competitive ESD options ranging from ultra-capacitors, to different kinds of batteries, flywheels and even compressed air-based storage. These ESDs offer very different trade-offs between their power and energy costs, densities, lifetimes, and energy efficiency, among other factors, suggesting that employing hybrid combinations of these may allow more effective DR than with a single technology. Furthermore, ESDs can be placed at different, and possibly multiple, levels of the power delivery hierarchy with different associated trade-offs. To our knowledge, no prior work has studied the extensive design space involving multiple ESD technology provisioning and placement options. This paper intends to fill this critical void, by presenting a theoretical framework for capturing important characteristics of different ESD technologies, the trade-offs of placing them at different levels of the power hierarchy, and quantifying the resulting cost-benefit trade-offs as a function of workload properties.", "authors": ["Di Wang", "Chuangang Ren", "Anand Sivasubramaniam", "Bhuvan Urgaonkar", "Hosam K.

{"abstract": "Although antiskid braking systems (ABS) are designed to optimize braking effectiveness while maintaining steerability, their performance often degrades under harsh road conditions (e.g. icy/snowy roads). The use of the fuzzy model reference learning control (FMRLC) technique for maintaining adequate performance even under such adverse road conditions is proposed. This controller utilizes a learning mechanism that observes the plant outputs and adjusts the rules in a direct fuzzy controller so that the overall system behaves like a reference model characterizing the desired behavior. The performance of the FMRLC-based ABS is demonstrated by simulation for various road conditions (wet asphalt, icy) and transitions between such conditions (e.g. when emergency braking occurs and the road switches from wet to icy or vice versa). >", "authors": ["Jeffery R.

These missing regions may be of arbitrary size and of random, but known, location. This problem occurs regularly with archived film material.

Both 3-D autoregressive models and 3-D Markov random fields are considered in the formulation of the different reconstruction processes. The models act along motion directions estimated using a multiresolution block matching scheme. It is possible to address this sort of impulsive noise suppression problem with median filters, and comparisons with earlier work using multilevel median filters are performed.

The process calculus is a form of \u03c0 -calculus, with probabilistic scheduling instead of nondeterminism, over a term language that captures probabilistic polynomial time. The operational semantics of this calculus gives priority to communication over private channels, so that the presence of private communication does not affect the observable probability of visible actions. Our definition of observational equivalence involves asymptotic comparison of uniform process families, only requiring equivalence to within vanishing error probabilities. This definition differs from previous notions of probabilistic process equivalence that require equal probabilities for corresponding actions; asymptotics fit our intended application and make equivalence transitive, thereby justifying the use of the term \"equivalence.\" Our security proof uses a series of lemmas about probabilistic observational equivalence that may well prove useful for establishing correctness of other cryptographic protocols.", "authors": ["Patrick Lincoln", "John C.

{"abstract": "Understanding user interests from text documents can provide support to personalized information recommendation services. Typically, these services automatically infer the user profile, a structured model of the user interests, from documents that were already deemed relevant by the user. Traditional keyword-based approaches are unable to capture the semantics of the user interests. This work proposes the integration of linguistic knowledge in the process of learning semantic user profiles that capture concepts concerning user interests. The proposed strategy consists of two steps. The first one is based on a word sense disambiguation technique that exploits the lexical database WordNet to select, among all the possible meanings (senses) of a polysemous word, the correct one. In the second step, a naive Bayes approach learns semantic sense-based user profiles as binary text classifiers (user-likes and user-dislikes) from disambiguated documents. Experiments have been conducted to compare the performance obtained by keyword-based profiles to that obtained by sense-based profiles. Both the classification accuracy and the effectiveness of the ranking imposed by the two different kinds of profile on the documents to be recommended have been considered. The main outcome is that the classification accuracy is increased with no improvement on the ranking. The conclusion is that the integration of linguistic knowledge in the learning process improves the classification of those documents whose classification score is close to the likes/dislikes threshold (the items for which the classification is highly uncertain).", "authors": ["Giovanni Semeraro", "Marco Degemmis", "Pasquale Lops", "Pierpaolo Basile"], "n_citation": 68, "references": ["3c3ce1cf-8c7a-444c-82d8-b428963784e6", "4adb467d-dacf-4019-b0d5-28ce1f323cf4", "6a6d14f3-83d4-4df4-bd27-94455c216c4f", "93cf69a3-9ef3-431e-8731-9d99d1535d7a", "96777897-5aa1-4105-a69d-b6bcf8a03bcf", "a2db16ac-8acf-4ac6-9a9f-342a15335570", "e07a5d67-1b3f-4465-89fa-4444e1f6cb2d", "ffddd6c1-aa4a-4e4e-bfc3-7df67626312a"], "title": "Combining learning and word sense disambiguation for intelligent user profiling", "venue": "international joint conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2007, "id": "deb2807b-c6c2-44c1-a9af-d3726d6a3ede"}

The efficiency and quality is exhibited in a live demonstration that recognizes CD-covers from a database of 40000 images of popular music CD\u0092s.

The local region descriptors are hierarchically quantized in a vocabulary tree. The vocabulary tree allows a larger and more discriminatory vocabulary to be used efficiently, which we show experimentally leads to a dramatic improvement in retrieval quality. The most significant property of the scheme is that the tree directly defines the quantization. The quantization and the indexing are therefore fully integrated, essentially being one and the same.

{"abstract": "From the Publisher:#R##N#This new work from Watts Humphrey, author of the influential book, Managing the Software Process, broadens his orderly view of software process management, and lays the foundation for a disciplined approach to software engineering. In his earlier book, the author developed concrete methods for managing software development and maintenance. These methods, now commonly practiced in industry, provide programmers and managers with specific steps they can take to evaluate and improve their software capabilities. In this new book, Humphrey scales those methods down to a personal level, helping software engineers develop the skills and habits needed to plan, track, and analyze large, complex projects. Humphrey and others have used material from this book to train professionals and students around the world in a projects-oriented software engineering course. First establishing the need for discipline in software engineering, and the benefits to practitioners of learning how to manage their personal software process, Humphrey then develops a model that they can use to monitor, test, and improve their work. Examples drawn from industry enhance the practical focus of the book, while project exercises give readers the opportunity to practice software process management as they learn it. Features: presents concepts and methods for a disciplined software engineering process; scales down industrial practices for planning, tracking, analysis, and defect management to fit the needs of small-scale program development; and shows how small project disciplines provide a solid base for larger projects.", "authors": ["Watts S.

{"abstract": "IBM defines autonomic computing as \"an approach to build computing systems that are self-managed and operate with a minimum of human interference\". To build an autonomic system, some characteristics such as self-knowledge, self-optimization, self-healing, self-defense, among others, have to be built into it. Service oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural paradigm that promotes development of software systems as sets of collaborative and loosely coupled services. It defines principals for achieving service interoperability, agility, reusability, integration and such others across heterogeneous distributed software systems. It is widely accepted that Web services are entities that provide many out-of-the-box capabilities for building service oriented software systems. Since the SOA approach has been proposed recently, various standards for addressing areas such as service orchestration, security, contract definition languages, policy exchange mechanisms and such others, are presently under development. One such key area that is gaining a lot of attention recently is Web service manageability. This paper discusses an approach for modeling the manageability of a Web service at design time and implementing that model to impart autonomic capabilities to it at run time. Of the various characteristics of autonomic systems self-knowledge, self-recovery and self-optimization are discussed herein.", "authors": ["Vishal Kapoor"], "n_citation": 50, "title": "Services and autonomic computing: a practical approach for designing manageability", "venue": "", "year": 2005, "id": "fb25414e-c7cb-4ece-9d08-89127e50285e"}
{"abstract": "When refinement methods were first shown to be applicable to data which was not totally regular, an immediate question was 'how does the limit surface behave around an extraordinary point?'. The technique of eigenanalysis was the answer then and is still the primary technique today. An issue only now becoming seriously important with the wider use of refine\u00ad ment methods is whether the processes introduce artifacts into the limit surface not implied by the original data. Certainly some examples can be shown, where the artifacts are serious, and a major challenge for the immediate future is whether we can understand them well enough to tune our systems to avoid creating them, or, if not, at least to tell our users how to avoid problems when defining the data for a refinement surface. We introduce the analysis techniques first in the univariate context, where we introduce the ideas which will be applied. Section 2 then applies these ideas in the bivariate context. In each section we address briefly the questions of: support, precision set and approximation order, before focussing on the use of eigenanalysis to determine the level of derivative continuity. At the end we look at what artifacts are, and possible approaches to analysing them.", "authors": ["Malcolm A.

We consider four such metrics over regions: the Hausdorff distance, the dual-Hausdorff distance, the area of the symmetric difference, and the optimal-homeomorphism metric (a generalization of the Frechet distance). Each of these gives a different criterion for continuous change. We establish qualitative properties of all of these; in particular, the continuity of basic functions such as union, intersection, set difference, area, distance, and smoothed circumference and the transition graph between RCC-8 relations.

This paper presents a connectionist architecture which automatically develops compact distributed representations for such compositional structures, as well as efficient accessing mechanisms for them. Patterns which stand for the internal nodes of fixed-valence trees are devised through the recursive use of backpropagation on three-layer auto-associative encoder networks. The resulting representations are novel, in that they combine apparently immiscible aspects of features, pointers, and symbol structures.

It is a generalization of the standard tree induction process where only the initial instance weights determine the type of tree to be induced-minimum error trees or minimum high cost error trees.

Previous research gave insufficient evidence to support the fact that the greedy divide-and-conquer algorithm can effectively induce a truly cost-sensitive tree directly from the training data. We provide this empirical evidence in this paper. The algorithm incorporating the instance-weighting method is found to be better than the original algorithm in terms of total misclassification costs, the number of high cost errors and tree size in two-class datasets.

{"abstract": "A separation algorithm for achieving color constancy and theorems concerning its accuracy are presented. The algorithm requires extra information, over and above the usual three values mapping human cone responses, from the optical system. However, with this additional information-specifically, a sampling across the visible range of the reflected, color-signal spectrum impinging on the optical sensor-the authors are able to separate the illumination spectrum from the surface reflectance spectrum contained in the color-signal spectrum which is, of course, the product of these two spectra. At the heart of the separation algorithm is a general statistical method for finding the best illumination and reflectance spectra, within a space represented by finite-dimensional linear models of statistically typical spectra, whose product closely corresponds to the spectrum of the actual color signal. Using this method, the authors are able to increase the dimensionality of the finite-dimensional linear model for surfaces to a realistic value. One method of generating the spectral samples required for the separation algorithm is to use the chromatic aberration effects of a lens. An example of this is given. The accuracy achieved in a large range of tests is detailed, and it is shown that agreement with actual surface reflectance is excellent. >", "authors": ["Jian Ho", "Brian V. Funt", "Mark S.

{"abstract": "This paper considers the distributed consensus problem of multi-agent systems with general continuous-time linear dynamics for both the cases without and with a leader whose control input might be nonzero and time varying. For the case without a leader, based on the relative output information of neighboring agents, two types of distributed adaptive dynamic consensus protocols are proposed, namely, the edge-based adaptive protocol which assigns a time-varying coupling weight to each edge in the communication graph and the node-based adaptive protocol which uses a time-varying coupling weight for each node. These two adaptive protocols are designed to ensure that consensus is reached in a fully distributed fashion for all undirected connected communication graphs. It is shown that the edge-based adaptive consensus protocol is applicable to arbitrary switching connected graphs. For the case where there exists a leader whose control input is possibly nonzero and bounded, a distributed continuous adaptive protocol is designed to guarantee the ultimate boundedness of the consensus error with respect to any communication graph which contains a directed spanning tree with the leader as the root and whose subgraph associated with the followers is undirected, requiring neither global information of the communication graph nor the upper bound of the leader\u2019s control input. A distributed discontinuous protocol is also discussed as a special case.

{"abstract": "An efficient solution to the fundamental problem of estimating the time-varying amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency of a real-valued signal that has both an AM and FM structure is provided. Nonlinear combinations of instantaneous signal outputs from the energy operator are used to separate its output energy product into its AM and FM components. The theoretical analysis is done first for continuous-time signals. Then several efficient algorithms are developed and compared for estimating the amplitude envelope and instantaneous frequency of discrete-time AM-FM signals. These energy separation algorithms are used to search for modulations in speech resonances, which are modeled using AM-FM signals to account for time-varying amplitude envelopes and instantaneous frequencies. The experimental results provide evidence that bandpass-filtered speech signals around speech formants contain amplitude and frequency modulations within a pitch period. >", "authors": ["Petros Maragos", "James F.

{"abstract": "We address the problem of computing the three-dimensional motions of objects in a long sequence of stereo frames. Our approach is bottom-up and consists of two levels. The first level deals with the tracking of 3D tokens from frame to frame and the estimation of their kinematics. The processing is completely parallel for each token. The second level groups tokens into objects based on their kinematic parameters, controls the processing at the low level to cope with problems such as occlusion, disappearance, and appearance of tokens, and provides information to other components of the system. We have implemented this approach using 3D line segments obtained from stereo as the tokens. We use classical kinematics and derive closed-form solutions for some special, but useful, cases of motions. The motion computation problem is then formulated as a tracking problem in order to apply the extended Kalman filter. The tracking is performed in a prediction-matching-update loop in which multiple matches can be handled. Tokens are labeled by a number called its support of existence which measures their adequation to the measurements. If this number goes beyond a threshold, the token disappears. The individual line segments can be grouped into rigid objects according to the similarity of their kinematic parameters.

{"abstract": "The shift from single to multiple core architectures means that programmers must write concurrent, multithreaded programs in order to increase application performance. Unfortunately, multithreaded applications are susceptible to numerous errors, including deadlocks, race conditions, atomicity violations, and order violations. These errors are notoriously difficult for programmers to debug.   This paper presents Grace, a software-only runtime system that eliminates concurrency errors for a class of multithreaded programs: those based on fork-join parallelism. By turning threads into processes, leveraging virtual memory protection, and imposing a sequential commit protocol, Grace provides programmers with the appearance of deterministic, sequential execution, while taking advantage of available processing cores to run code concurrently and efficiently. Experimental results demonstrate Grace's effectiveness: with modest code changes across a suite of computationally-intensive benchmarks (1-16 lines), Grace can achieve high scalability and performance while preventing concurrency errors.", "authors": ["Emery D.

{"abstract": "To better utilize the capacity of the twisted-pair access networks, operators deploying very high-speed digital subscriber line (VDSL) systems need accurate parameters for power back-off (PBO). However, VDSL standards give almost no guidance on how these parameters should be established for a particular network. In this paper we present a new technique for optimizing PBO parameters for a cable bundle, which is based on the Nelder-Mead simplex search algorithm. In this way each operator can easily calculate PBO parameters that match its actual access network down to the individual cable bundle. Using the properties of the PBO, as defined in the VDSL standard, we show how a normalized FEXT coupling can replace the knowledge of the individual couplings during the optimization of the PBO parameters. By simulations based on measured cable data we show that our approach using cable bundle unique PBO (CUPBO) achieves a significant improvements compared to the performance achieved with the ordinary PBO.", "authors": ["Milos Jakovljevic", "Driton Statovci", "Tomas Nordstr\u00f6m", "Rickard Nilsson", "Santiago Zazo"], "n_citation": 12, "references": ["6dd9e30e-72fe-412d-ad08-fa327064862e", "c0b33abf-054f-414c-b33d-a19969873940", "d0026c4b-1de8-4d5a-ad02-b10872eb8310", "d85b3471-0e06-4e9d-889e-673ce26225e9"], "title": "VDSL power back-off parameter optimization for a cable bundle", "venue": "", "year": 2007, "id": "1eef4ce5-2a63-4a3a-9251-201343841275"}
{"abstract": "Objective Healthcare organizations must de-identify patient records before sharing data. Many organizations relyontheSafeHarborStandardoftheHIPAAPrivacyRule, which enumerates 18 identifiers that must be suppressed (eg, ages over 89). An alternative model in the Privacy Rule, known as the Statistical Standard, can facilitate the sharingofmoredetaileddata,butisrarelyappliedbecause of a lack of published methodologies. The authors propose an intuitive approach to de-identifying patient demographicsinaccordancewiththeStatisticalStandard. Design The authors conduct an analysis of the demographics of patient cohorts in five medical centers developed for the NIH-sponsored Electronic Medical Records and Genomics network, with respect to the US census. They report the re-identification risk of patient demographics disclosed according to the Safe Harbor policy and the relative risk rate for sharing such information via alternative policies. Measurements The re-identification risk of Safe Harbor demographics ranged from 0.01% to 0.19%. The findings show alternative de-identification models can be created with risks no greater than Safe Harbor. The authors illustrate that the disclosure of patient ages over the age of 89 is possible when other features are reduced in granularity. Limitations The de-identification approach described in this paper was evaluated with demographic data only and should be evaluated with other potential identifiers. Conclusion Alternative de-identification policies to the Safe Harbor model can be derived for patient demographicstoenablethedisclosureofvaluesthatwere previously suppressed.

{"abstract": "Mobile computers often suffer from limited connectivity, or even complete lack of network access. Moreover, in wireless networks some machines are often more accessible to mobile computers than others are. Ideally, nomadic users want the same quality and speed of database access as when they are well connected to the network. Replicated databases meet this need by allowing each mobile machine to carry its own copy of key data. But existing replicated systems are not well suited for all nomadic scenarios. Certain important mobile computing situations require optimistic peer-oriented database replication. The Bengal Database Replication System has these characteristics and was designed to operate in difficult nomadic conditions. This paper presents the design assumptions of the system, describes its architecture, presents performance data on its operation, and discusses future enhancements for the system. The paper also contrasts the system to other replicated databases, concentrating on their suitability for nomadic computing.

{"abstract": "Open source software development may be superior to proprietary development because the open source organizational form naturally minimizes transactions costs associated with privately distributed information, thereby avoiding certain agency problems. This manifests itself in the ability of open source communities to encourage collaborative sharing of ideas and critical peer review. When these activities are important, the open source organizational form endogenously may do better than a proprietary organizational form. The desire to improve quality by circumventing such agency concerns may induce the founder of a software project to choose the open source form even though doing so foregoes potential profits, and this effect is magnified when there is an existing competing closed source project.

{"abstract": "This paper is about the utility of making personalized recommendations. While it is important to accurately predict the target user's preference, in practice the accuracy should not be the  only concern ; a useful recommender system needs to consider the user's utility or satisfaction of fulfilling a certain information seeking task. For example, recommending popular items (products) is unlikely to result in more gain than discovering insignificant (\"long tail\") yet liked items because the popular ones might be already known to the user. Equally, recommending items that are out of stock would be frustrating for both the user and system if the system is employed to discover items to purchase. Thus, it is important to have a flexible recommendation framework that takes into account additional recommendation goals meanwhile minimizing the performance loss in order to provide greater adjustability and a better user experience.   To achieve this, in this paper, we propose a general recommendation optimization framework that not only considers the predicted preference scores (e.g. ratings) but also deals with additional operational or resource related recommendation goals. Using this framework we demonstrate through realistic examples how to expand existing rating prediction algorithms by biasing the recommendation depending on other external factors such as the availability, profitability or usefulness of an item. Our experiments on real data sets demonstrate that this framework is indeed able to cope with multiple objectives with minor performance loss.", "authors": ["Tamas Jambor", "Jun Wang"], "n_citation": 60, "references": ["05f5fba9-e7ca-4c46-be79-df57944a8b41", "0ea745c7-58b2-48e8-9115-42e9b0d20f2a", "1079deef-c353-43d0-bcee-53371b97a1cf", "216c73c8-f167-463d-ba26-210b97e46545", "224926b6-9c8e-4c6d-87ea-4405fd2002e5", "2ac727d1-f899-46c3-92ba-0abc0f6f42ae", "2c58beb8-caea-4ff2-92dc-5fc16700d6a1", "487cabdb-6a18-426b-b66b-d5abca8d2747", "63be4f60-4979-41b5-8bd6-7120e094d8d6", "67cd789b-fff5-4a89-90d0-d39102b31da4", "6e425bce-a497-4c63-9eb0-b038e660a54f", "752c83ba-e9b4-43d6-ad9f-1513038dd880", "8293267a-ea8c-4770-bc83-7c78ff0a2d12", "99f4a163-1883-49d3-8d25-d8854327601a", "9b602954-f960-46fe-87ae-41f06c486efc", "a5985b36-9a4d-46cd-9194-0a8b7c091b2c", "afaee3cb-390a-4b89-9dbf-c053399f906a", "bb35cf23-c441-40a1-a704-037faa5d4454", "ce2a2fa1-d278-443a-870c-28aae29cc9aa", "cff1b7c3-dc60-4ac0-a016-0e4b5070310a", "d07c5f39-e014-4306-ba69-86ea8df76a4c", "d3ec5b39-7147-440d-82b0-4c4d05e671c9", "d6797b86-afca-40cd-a1ae-a5063446c9a4", "ed4c0d5d-5152-4915-b9bd-d0bd25f82674"], "title": "Optimizing multiple objectives in collaborative filtering", "venue": "conference on recommender systems", "year": 2010, "id": "fd43e151-cb22-45ac-85a7-1f79046f22a3"}

{"abstract": "Distributed applications that can adapt at runtime to changing quality of service (QoS) require a model of the expected QoS and of the possible application adaptations. QoS models in turn require runtime measurements, both in-band and out-of-band, from across the application's components. As the comprehensiveness of the model increases, so does the quality of adaptation. But eventually the increasing comprehensiveness becomes too complex for the QoS Designer to deal with effectively. In addition, performance models of any complexity are expensive to create and maintain at runtime. The QoS Designer therefore needs a set of distributed-QoS tools to assist in the construction of models, the handling of quality vs. complexity tradeoffs, and the efficient maintenance of models at runtime. This paper describes the Quality Objects (QuO) middleware support that provides for developing a performance model; collecting and organizing run-time measurements of a system, both in-band and out-of-band; and maintaining the model at runtime in an efficient way.", "authors": ["John A.

{"abstract": "Design patterns aim at improving reusability and variability of object-oriented software. Despite a notable success,  aspect-oriented programming (AOP)  has been discussed recently to improve the design pattern implementations. In another line of research it has been noticed that  feature-oriented programming (FOP)  is related closely to AOP and that FOP suffices in many situations where AOP is commonly used. In this paper we explore the assumed duality between AOP and FOP mechanisms. As a case study we use the aspect-oriented design pattern implementations of Hannemann and Kiczales. We observe that almost all of the 23 aspect-oriented design pattern implementations can be transformed straightforwardly into equivalent feature-oriented design patterns.

{"abstract": "Building software systems out of prefabricated components is a very attractive vision. Distributed component platforms (DCP) and their visual-development environments bring this vision closer to reality than ever. At the same time, some experiences with component libraries warn us about potential problems that arise when software-system families or systems evolve over many years of changes. Indeed, implementation-level components, when affected by many independent changes, tend to grow in both size and number, impeding reuse. This unwanted effect is analysed in detail. It is argued that components affected by frequent unexpected changes require higher levels of flexibility than the `plug-and-play' paradigm is able to provide. A program-construction environment is proposed, based on generative programming techniques, to help in customisation and evolution of components that require much flexibility. This solution allows the benefits of DCPs to be reaped during runtime and, at the same time, keeps components under control during system construction and evolution. Salient features of a construction environment for component-based systems are discussed. Its implementation with commercial reuse technology FusionTM is described, illustrating with examples from domain-engineering projects. The main lesson learnt from the project is that generative-programming techniques can extend the strengths of the component-based approach in two important ways. First, generative-programming techniques automate routine component customisation and composition tasks and allow developers work more productively, at a higher abstraction level. Secondly, as custom components with required properties are generated on demand, it is not necessary to store and manage multiple versions of components; components do not overly grow in size, helping developers keep the complexity of an evolving system under control.", "authors": ["Stan Jarzabek", "Rudolph E.

The semantics of recursive classes is captured by a fixpoint construction. The representation of classes is a shallow encoding that orthogonally extends the encoding HOL-Z of plain Z in Isabelle/HOL.

{"abstract": "The problem of learning with positive and unlabeled examples arises frequently in retrieval applications. We transform the problem into a problem of learning with noise by labeling all unlabeled examples as negative and use a linear function to learn from the noisy examples. To learn a linear function with noise, we perform logistic regression after weighting the examples to handle noise rates of greater than a half. With appropriate regularization, the cost function of the logistic regression problem is convex, allowing the problem to be solved efficiently. We also propose a performance measure that can be estimated from positive and unlabeled examples for evaluating retrieval performance. The measure, which is proportional to the product of precision and recall, can be used with a validation set to select regularization parameters for logistic regression.

{"abstract": "In a social context, people have only partial knowledge about the world and use arguments in order to solve problems, to reduce conflicts, or to exchange information.#R##N##R##N#Argumentation is a dialogic process, and could occur through direct interaction, or through supports of some sorts--like blackboards, or electronic fora. The same holds for intelligent agents in a multi-agent system (MAS); here, however, it is not clear what could act as a support for argumentation between agents, external to the agents themselves. To this end, this work exploits the agents and artifacts (A&A) meta-model for MAS, exploring the use of artifacts for agent argumentation within a MAS. Along this line, the first aim of this work is to design an argumentation component based on Dung's preferred semantics, combining it with artifact abstraction in order to realise a social support for argumentation in MAS. Using argumentation within the A&A meta-model, we introduce here the notion of Co-Argumentation Artifact (CAA) as an artifact specialised in managing arguments and providing a coordination service for argumentation process in a MAS.

{"abstract": "In this brief, adaptive neural control is presented for a class of output feedback nonlinear systems in the presence of unknown functions. The unknown functions are handled via on-line neural network (NN) control using only output measurements. A barrier Lyapunov function (BLF) is introduced to address two open and challenging problems in the neuro-control area: 1) for any initial compact set, how to determine  a priori  the compact superset, on which NN approximation is valid; and 2) how to ensure that the arguments of the unknown functions remain within the specified compact superset. By ensuring boundedness of the BLF, we actively constrain the argument of the unknown functions to remain within a compact superset such that the NN approximation conditions hold. The semiglobal boundedness of all closed-loop signals is ensured, and the tracking error converges to a neighborhood of zero.

{"abstract": "This paper describes a trainable system capable of tracking faces and facial features like eyes and nostrils and estimating basic mouth features such as degrees of openness and smile in real time. In developing this system, we have addressed the twin issues of image representation and algorithms for learning. We have used the invariance properties of image representations based on Haar wavelets to robustly capture various facial features. Similarly, unlike previous approaches this system is entirely trained using examples and does not rely on a priori (hand-crafted) models of facial features based on an optical flow or facial musculature. The system works in several stages that begin with face detection, followed by localization of facial features and estimation of mouth parameters. Each of these stages is formulated as a problem in supervised learning from examples. We apply the new and robust technique of support vector machines (SVM) for classification in the stage of skin segmentation, face detection and eye detection. Estimation of mouth parameters is modeled as a regression from a sparse subset of coefficients (basis functions) of an overcomplete dictionary of Haar wavelets.", "authors": ["Vinay P.

In a simulation using randomly generated task graphs, on the average, 98.28% of the dependencies are eliminated in the first phase, and 65.86% of the remaining dependencies are eliminated during the second phase, for a total of 99.41% removed.

{"abstract": "Denoising algorithms based on gradient dependent regularizers, such as nonlinear diffusion processes and total variation denoising, modify images towards piecewise constant functions. Although edge sharpness and location is well preserved, important information, encoded in image features like textures or certain details, is often compromised in the process of denoising. We propose a mechanism that better preserves fine scale features in such denoising processes. A basic pyramidal structure-texture decomposition of images is presented and analyzed. A first level of this pyramid is used to isolate the noise and the relevant texture components in order to compute spatially varying constraints based on local variance measures. A variational formulation with a spatially varying fidelity term controls the extent of denoising over image regions. Our results show visual improvement as well as an increase in the signal-to-noise ratio over scalar fidelity term processes.

{"abstract": "This thesis uses a physical, intrinsic reflection model to analyze the effects of shading and highlights on dielectric, non-uniform materials, such as plastics and paints. Since black-and-white images do not provide sufficient information to interpret these effects appropriately, this work uses color images. The colors seen on a dielectric object are an additive mixture of the object color and the illumination color, i.e.: the colors are a linear combination of those two color vectors. They therefore lie in a plane in the color space. Within the plane, they form a cluster that looks like a skewed T, due to the geometric properties of shading and highlight reflection.#R##N#When combined with a camera model, this description of physically possible color changes on one object can be used to guide an algorithm in interpreting color images. It is the basis of an algorithm that analyzes color variation in real color images. The algorithm looks for characteristic color clusters in the image and relates their shape to hypotheses on the object color and the amount of shading, as well as the position, strength and color of highlights on the object. It verifies the hypotheses by reapplying them back to the image, testing whether and how they apply to the pixels in the local image area from which the respective hypothesis was derived. In this way, it adapts the image interpretation process to local scene characteristics and reacts differently to color and intensity changes at different places in the image.#R##N#The result is an image segmentation that ignores color changes due to shading and highlights, as well as a set of intrinsic images, one describing the amount of shading at every pixel in the image, and the other one showing the amount highlight reflection at every pixel. Such intrinsic images can be a useful tool for other areas of computer vision that are currently disturbed by highlights in images, such as stereo vision and motion analysis. The approach can also be used to determine the illumination color from the highlights and as a preprocessor for methods to determine object shape from shading or highlights. This line of research may lead to physics-based image understanding methods that are both more reliable and more useful than traditional methods.

{"abstract": "The Web service (WS) paradigm is an emerging approach to building Web applications, in which software designers typically build new WSs by leveraging existing, third-party WSs. Understanding performance characteristics of third party WSs is critical to the overall system performance. Although such performance evaluation can be done through testing of third party WSs, it is quite an expensive process. This is especially the case when testing at high workloads, because performance degradations are likely to occur, which may render the WS under testing unusable during the testsi\u00a6 duration. Avoiding testing at high workloads by applying standard extrapolation approaches from data collected at low workloads (e.g., using regression analysis) results in a lack of accuracy. To address this challenge, in this paper, we propose a framework that utilizes the benefits of queueing models to guide the extrapolation process, while achieving accuracy in both regimes iV low and high workloads. Our extensive experiments show that our approach gives accurate results as compared to standard techniques (i.e., use of regression analysis alone).", "authors": ["Leslie Cheung", "Leana Golubchik", "Fei Sha"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0365e06d-25db-4180-a191-0ec3eeff51d4", "044d359c-f943-4b11-8298-fe1b959c8d79", "38af21ab-3b47-4f23-8717-fcd8a2202d56", "40030948-d279-4712-a99e-aa15bd8f6c62", "420aa5d6-c7f9-4982-9cbc-dd6ecb06ffe4", "56c23f2c-a471-4332-8d50-148e4be7bed7", "a043fd0e-9acb-4588-bd84-575ba57243ec", "a4d5cb9d-c3a8-49b7-b6c8-effd7b6fa581", "af481f6f-28ed-450b-97ab-90053e681184", "bb010799-92dc-43b2-b0ba-cfcc09e6e07f", "d22a0d72-95e3-48fb-a78a-50879fd16741", "fd0827cd-5709-4048-94fd-572968165b1e", "fd4e8c45-be77-49de-a6a8-a8ab1acac344"], "title": "A Study of Web Services Performance Prediction: A Client's Perspective", "venue": "modeling, analysis, and simulation on computer and telecommunication systems", "year": 2011, "id": "b72ade1b-eee3-49c2-b6ec-4c608ae1e4f8"}

{"abstract": "Wayfinding in the public transportation infrastructure takes place on traffic networks. These consist of lines that are interconnected at nodes. The network is the basis for routing decisions; it is usually presented in maps and through digital interfaces. But to the traveller, the stops and stations that make up the nodes are at least as important as the network, for it is there that the complexity of the system is experienced. These observations suggest that there are two cognitively different environments involved, which we will refer to as network space and scene space. Network space consists of the public transport network. Scene space consists of the environment at the nodes of the public transport system, through which travellers enter and leave the system and in which they change means of transport. We explore properties of the two types of spaces and how they interact to assist wayfinding. We also show how they can be modelled: for network space, graphs can be used; for scene space we propose a novel model based on cognitive schemata and partial orders.", "authors": ["Urs-Jakob R\u00fcetschi", "Sabine Timpf"], "n_citation": 56, "references": ["01d72974-f301-4015-afa4-80aaf6e01e35", "0dbd0d8c-a531-4c08-a29b-6786aa22b22c", "2ef98ba4-96cf-4c7a-bc1e-0cfa4e044b0e", "3934ec19-dacb-4665-baa5-3c35b224a937", "71b3dad1-7522-4055-ba7e-c3eb1773f787", "9a07a106-61d6-4d6b-b3b0-2a3b3c0e77b0", "bf2fff4d-a473-47aa-90e7-c420d4adc84d", "ccfcf761-3f4b-4bd3-8dbc-2334472a3960", "dcf99ebc-faed-4a8a-93e5-b8dba01b35b0", "f3f17ff6-2739-4c2f-a08c-1621e13fed03"], "title": "Modelling wayfinding in public transport: network space and scene space", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "id": "2a74d9fd-a000-4133-b225-60526fc27fe4"}

This paper examines alliances where member firms have balanced power and where full cooperation of all related members is required to achieve the full benefits of technology implementation. We propose that different social categories within an alliance, especially categories formed by the differential use of RFID, play an important role in shaping group members' perceptions and beliefs about RFID systems as well as about each other, and their decisions about adopting the systems.

Our goal is to search for the strategy that best comprises the performance and hardware-cost criteria. For the dynamic controller, a decentralized predictive controller based on a linearized model of the vehicle is used.

{"abstract": "An aspect observes the execution of a base program; when certain actions occur, the aspect runs some extra code of its own. In the AspectJ language, the observations that an aspect can make are confined to the  current  action: it is not possible to directly observe the  history  of a computation.Recently, there have been several interesting proposals for new history-based language features, most notably by Douence  et al.  and by Walker and Viggers. In this paper, we present a new history-based language feature called  tracematches  that enables the programmer to trigger the execution of extra code by specifying a regular pattern of events in a computation trace. We have fully designed and implemented tracematches as a seamless extension of AspectJ.A key innovation in our tracematch approach is the introduction of free variables in the matching patterns. This enhancement enables a whole new class of applications in which events can be matched not only by the event kind, but also by the values associated with the free variables. We provide several examples of applications enabled by this feature.After introducing and motivating the idea of tracematches via examples, we present a detailed semantics of our language design, and we derive an implementation from that semantics.

{"abstract": "The XML Stream Machine (XSM) system is a novel XQuery processing paradigm that is tuned to the efficient processing of sequentially accessed XML data (streams). The system compiles a given XQuery into an XSM, which is an XML stream transducer, i.e., an abstract device that takes as input one or more XML data streams and produces one or more output streams, potentially using internal buffers. We present a systematic way to translate XQueries into efficient XSMs: First the XQuery is translated into a network of XSMs that correspond to the basic operators of the XQuery language and exchange streams.

However, understanding the usage motivations and the unintended effects that those technologies have on communities is limited particularly for rural users. The purpose of this study is to explore the benefits and usage of an asynchronous wireless Internet system in a rural village of Cambodia. By employing qualitative methods of indepth case analysis we revealed various usage motivations and unintended effects of the system. We derived five motivations of users to use the system; avowed identity, mean to an end, maintaining personal ties, power influence, and psychological commitment and ownership. Unintended effects of the system were the increase in interactions among actors and other forms of system usages including; Internet commerce, telemedicine, and e-government.", "authors": ["Sophea Chea", "Margaret Meiling Luo", "Tung X.

{"abstract": "Least squares support vector machines (LS-SVM) is an SVM version which involves equality instead of inequality constraints and works with a least squares cost function. In this way, the solution follows from a linear Karush\u2013Kuhn\u2013Tucker system instead of a quadratic programming problem. However, sparseness is lost in the LS-SVM case and the estimation of the support values is only optimal in the case of a Gaussian distribution of the error variables. In this paper, we discuss a method which can overcome these two drawbacks. We show how to obtain robust estimates for regression by applying a weighted version of LS-SVM. We also discuss a sparse approximation procedure for weighted and unweighted LS-SVM. It is basically a pruning method which is able to do pruning based upon the physical meaning of the sorted support values, while pruning procedures for classical multilayer perceptrons require the computation of a Hessian matrix or its inverse. The methods of this paper are illustrated for RBF kernels and demonstrate how to obtain robust estimates with selection of an appropriate number of hidden units, in the case of outliers or non-Gaussian error distributions with heavy tails.", "authors": ["J.A.K.

{"abstract": "Many researchers believe that groupware can only be evaluated by studying real collaborators in their real contexts, a process that tends to be expensive and time-consuming. Others believe that it is more practical to evaluate groupware through usability inspection methods. Deciding between these two approaches is difficult, because it is unclear how they compare in a real evaluation situation. To address this problem, we carried out a dual evaluation of a groupware system, with one evaluation applying user-based techniques, and the other using inspection methods. We compared the results from the two evaluations and concluded that, while the two methods have their own strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs, they are complementary. Because the two methods found overlapping problems, we expect that they can be used in tandem to good effect, e.g., applying the discount method prior to a field study, with the expectation that the system deployed in the more expensive field study has a better chance of doing well because some pertinent usability problems will have already been addressed.", "authors": ["Michelle Potts Steves", "Emile L.

{"abstract": "Charitable giving is influenced by many social, psychological, and economic factors. One common way to encourage individuals to donate to charities is by offering to match their contribution (often by their employer or by the government). Conitzer and Sandholm introduced the idea of using auctions to allow individuals to offer to match the contribution of others. We explore this idea in a social network setting, where individuals care about the contribution of their neighbors, and are allowed to specify contributions that are conditional on the contribution of their neighbors.   We give a mechanism for this setting that raises the largest individually rational contributions given the conditional bids, and analyze the equilibria of this mechanism in the case of linear utilities. We show that if the social network is strongly connected, the mechanism always has an equilibrium that raises the maximum total contribution (which is the contribution computed according to the true utilities); in other words, the price of stability of the game defined by this mechanism is one. Interestingly, although the mechanism is  not  dominant strategy truthful (and in fact, truthful reporting need not even be a Nash equilibrium of this game), this result shows that the mechanism always has a full-information equilibrium which achieves the same outcome as in the truthful scenario. Of course, there exist cases where the maximum total contribution even with true utilities is zero: we show that the existence of non-zero equilibria can be characterized exactly in terms of the largest eigenvalue of the utility matrix associated with the social network.", "authors": ["Arpita Ghosh", "Mohammad Mahdian"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["6f689d6b-ed05-4070-bad5-5daca64f174b"], "title": "Charity auctions on social networks", "venue": "symposium on discrete algorithms", "year": 2008, "id": "f9dd1bad-1288-46e0-8a22-1d73bda14dfa"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents a multicast algorithm for peer-to-peer dissemination of events in a distributed topic-based publish-subscribe system, where processes publish events of certain topics, organized in a hierarchy, and expect events of topics they subscribed to. Our algorithm is \"data-aware\" in the sense that it exploits information about process subscriptions and topic inclusion relationships to build dynamic groups of processes and efficiently manage the flow of information within and between these process groups. This \"data-awareness\" helps limit the membership information that each process needs to maintain and preserves processes from receiving messages related to topics they have not subscribed to. It also provides the application with means to control, for each topic in a hierarchy, the trade-off between the message complexity and the reliability of event dissemination.

In this paper, we generalize the previous results by considering arbitrary attack intervals. We obtain two sets of new results for a web server with feedback-based admission control. First, we model the web server under the attack as a switched system. By proving the Lyapunov and Lagrange stability of the system, we show that the admission rate can always be throttled to a bounded low value. Second, we investigate the worst impacts of a DoQ attack by optimizing a utility function for the attacks. As a result, we obtain for the first time optimal attack patterns for both periodic and aperiodic attacks.

{"abstract": "Cheetahs and beetles run, dolphins and salmon swim, and bees and birds fly with grace and economy surpassing our technology. Evolution has shaped the breathtaking abilities of animals, leaving us the challenge of reconstructing their targets of control and mechanisms of dexterity. In this review we explore a corner of this fascinating world. We describe mathematical models for legged animal locomotion, focusing on rapidly running insects and highlighting past achievements and challenges that remain. Newtonian body--limb dynamics are most naturally formulated as piecewise-holonomic rigid body mechanical systems, whose constraints change as legs touch down or lift off. Central pattern generators and proprioceptive sensing require models of spiking neurons and simplified phase oscillator descriptions of ensembles of them. A full neuromechanical model of a running animal requires integration of these elements, along with proprioceptive feedback and models of goal-oriented sensing, planning, and learning. We outline relevant background material from biomechanics and neurobiology, explain key properties of the hybrid dynamical systems that underlie legged locomotion models, and provide numerous examples of such models, from the simplest, completely soluble \"peg-leg walker\" to complex neuromuscular subsystems that are yet to be assembled into models of behaving animals. This final integration in a tractable and illuminating model is an outstanding challenge.", "authors": ["Philip Holmes", "Robert J. Full", "Daniel E.

The experiments reported in this paper show that the use of these heuristics results in a considerable improvement in the quality of sparse-matrix orderings over conventional ordering methods, especially for sparse matrices arising in linear programming problems.

{"abstract": "We consider disjunctive Datalog, a powerful database query language based on disjunctive logic programming.  Briefly, disjunctive Datalog is a variant of Datalog where disjunctions may appear in the rule heads; advanced versions also allow for negation in the bodies which can be handled according to a semantics for negation in disjunctive logic programming.  In particular, we investigate three different semantics for disjunctive Datalog: the minimal model semantics the perfect model semantics, and the stable model semantics.  For each of these semantics, the  expressive power and complexity are studied.  We show that the possibility variants of these semantics express the same set of queries.  In fact, they precisely capture the complexity class         P  2     . Thus, unless the Polynomial     Hierarchy collapses, disjunctive Datalog is more expressive that normal logic programming with negation.  These results are not only of theoretical interest; we demonstrate that problems relevant in practice such as computing the optimal tour value in the Traveling Salesman Problem and eigenvector computations can be handled in disjunctive Datalog, but not Datalog with negation (unless the Polynomial Hierarchy collapses).  In addition, we study modularity properties of disjunctive Datalog and investigate syntactic restrictions of the formalisms.", "authors": ["Thomas Eiter", "Georg Gottlob", "Heikki Mannila"], "n_citation": 528, "references": ["05f59ebe-6fcf-435e-ad81-a13583c94c23", "09c19ddd-b0a4-477d-bc0b-025882bca35a", "0cf57a36-e29c-4877-8021-24a89ec825cf", "1f22395d-da33-4dd8-a277-10d978e41a6f", "26c2a1d0-d697-486d-be82-203e6de91d29", "2a0444d7-90e4-447c-9e89-323b7e72e5e8", "2b1f4416-ee6e-459c-a507-70d86beafa8e", "2f540642-7318-478e-8ff7-be5f04e8eb4b", "32f95722-0762-4661-9cc1-cc3d00af2ae9", "382f9fd2-5daf-47a5-a8fa-565fabbb73ec", "3932a5df-2240-45bd-ab69-b284646fe33b", "3caeada5-f0e4-41fb-8d49-3f12761d47a0", "421d005a-b505-4578-8782-8b311eabbe75", "43959b1e-98f1-45c5-a7eb-cfeb9ce364d9", "495101eb-a786-454f-b853-0f289985ae59", "62fb5087-5af2-4ea3-b4bc-9e2748e30203", "68d5aa79-539c-4f9d-a3c8-1a053380aa6c", "6ebb37de-4861-49a1-8eab-e386862c695a", "71dd8461-ecb7-4f91-afed-6b58f4c7f08a", "7399bf1f-9ac9-4d46-bc82-0ef9a02ce621", "76fa41bb-4b39-42f4-8eea-5e376770ef60", "7d7e056e-aaee-488e-be00-54af391faaaa", "7f520a94-ddc2-4ee6-90bf-0b40abe9f73c", "84b5d8e9-d788-42ce-9842-1a2060d2251d", "88cdd30a-0260-442e-8143-78a73ef6c396", "965ca050-46ef-4b35-8358-ba86a6231947", "9a069b03-2b05-4dd9-ac87-eb43cba35fec", "a89ae3fd-af15-4084-956e-3ff48a66260b", "acead986-913e-4b38-9127-016d2ebd21e9", "b86ff135-5f40-483d-9d85-62e21878b5e4", "bd686f53-4e11-4015-a9a2-15c06ddefdbf", "bf06c66c-b76e-49c4-a273-95e7f69cd265", "c5368c25-5748-4af2-8b0f-f2cca8dbb4f0", "c5c89582-cd7e-4d08-abc6-f42a95840a60", "c5dc72b8-5aee-47c2-b7b0-045abb1dac51", "d1122668-0bda-4061-860f-0ed236689269", "d4abb642-adba-4acd-b090-0291a866c627", "d4b598be-9b36-495d-87da-31055019c108", "d67754f6-4658-4b23-9f06-a5ee0ee19eae", "db658327-1f48-4f80-8f7d-09d88096f297", "dee6984f-75aa-478c-a413-5442908310f7", "e22908da-10e5-49ec-93ed-2d7b1e1e8da3", "e9cb4f12-f852-4a0d-bc43-822771528cbd", "eb5c8a78-8069-4732-ad9c-5a62b159fe94", "eba510ad-c220-44a3-8c66-306d6cb45d2e", "f0315c60-9807-477b-bec5-9058f58f58aa"], "title": "Disjunctive datalog", "venue": "ACM Transactions on Database Systems", "year": 1997, "id": "c404c1bf-4992-42d3-a280-ed6227964e4f"}

{"abstract": "Bug triaging aims to assign a bug to the most appropriate fixer. That task is crucial in reducing time and efforts in a bug fixing process. In this paper, we propose Bugzie, a novel approach for automatic bug triaging based on fuzzy set and cache-based modeling of the bug-fixing expertise of developers. Bugzie considers a software system to have multiple technical aspects, each of which is associated with technical terms. For each technical term, it uses a fuzzy set to represent the developers who are capable/competent of fixing the bugs relevant to the corresponding aspect. The fixing correlation of a developer toward a technical term is represented by his/her membership score toward the corresponding fuzzy set. The score is calculated based on the bug reports that (s)he has fixed, and is updated as the newly fixed bug reports are available. For a new bug report, Bugzie combines the fuzzy sets corresponding to its terms and ranks the developers based on their membership scores toward that combined fuzzy set to find the most capable fixers. Our empirical results show that Bugzie achieves significantly higher accuracy and time efficiency than existing state-of-the-art approaches.", "authors": ["Ahmed Tamrawi", "Tung Thanh Nguyen", "Jafar M.

{"abstract": "Abstract   Metric-based classification trees provide an approach for identifying user-specified classes of high-risk software components throughout the software lifecycle. Based on measurable attributes of software components and processors, this empirically guided approach derives models of problematic software components. These models, which are represented as classification trees, are used on future systems to identify components likely to share the same high-risk properties. Example high-risk component properties include being fault-prone, change-prone, or effort-prone, or containing certain types of faults. Identifying these components allows developers to focus the application of specialized techniques and tools for analyzing, testing, and constructing software. A validation study using metric data from 16 NASA systems showed that the trees had an average classification accuracy of 79.3% for fault-prone and effort-prone components in that environment.  One fundamental feature of the classification tree generation algorithm is the method used for partitioning the metric data values into mutually exclusive and exhaustive ranges. This study compares the accuracy and the complexity of trees resulting from five techniques for partitioning metric data values. The techniques are quartiles, octiles, and three methods based on least weight subsequence (LWS-\u03c7) analysis, where \u03c7 is the upper bound on the number of partitions. The LWS-3 and LWS-5 partition techniques resulted in trees with higher accuracy (in terms of completeness and consistency) than did quartiles and octiles. LWS-3 and LWS-5 trees were not statistically different in terms of accuracy, but LWS-3 trees had lower complexity than all other methods in terms of the number of unique metrics required. The trees from the three LWS methods (LWS-3, LWS-5, and LWS-8) had lower complexity than did the trees from quartiles and octiles. In general, the results indicate that distribution-sensitive partition techniques that use only relatively few partitions, such as the least weight subsequence techniques LWS-3 and LWS-5, can increase accuracy and decrease complexity in classification trees. Classification analysis techniques, along with other empirically based analysis techniques for large-scale software, will be supported in the  Amadeus  measurement and empirical analysis system.", "authors": ["Adam A.

These automata are analyzed by creating an abstraction of the hybrid model, which is a finite state discrete transition system, and then performing the computation on the abstracted system. All the steps, from model generation to the simplification of the reachable set, have been automated using a variety of decision procedure and theorem-proving tools. The concluding example computes the reach set for a four cell network with 8 continuous and 256 discrete states. This demonstrates the feasibility of using these tools to compute on high dimensional hybrid automata, to provide deeper insight into realistic biological systems.", "authors": ["Ronojoy Ghosh", "Ashish Tiwari", "Claire J.

The 42 participants rated the similarity of all 903 pairs of descriptors, and we subjected the resulting similarity matrix to multidimensional scaling, factor analysis, and cluster analysis. Two main factors emerged, which were interpreted as comfort and discomfort. Based on these findings, we postulate a hypothetical model for perception of comfort and discomfort.

Each class distinction can be biologically interpreted in terms of its supporting genes. The mathematical characterization of the favored class distinctions is based on statistical concepts.

{"abstract": "This paper develops a typed calculus for contexts i.e., lambda terms with \"holes\". In addition to ordinary lambda terms, the calculus contains labeled holes, hole abstraction and context application for manipulating first-class contexts. The primary operation for contexts is hole-filling, which captures free variables. This operation conflicts with substitution of the lambda calculus, and a straightforward mixture of the two results in an inconsistent system. We solve this problem by defining a type system that precisely specifies the variable-capturing nature of contexts and that keeps track of bound variable renaming. These mechanisms enable us to define a reduction system that properly integratesb-reduction and hole-filling. The resulting calculus is Church-Rosser and the type system has the subject reduction property. We believe that the context calculus will serve as a basis for developing a programming language with advanced features that call for manipulation of open terms.

{"abstract": "Heavy-duty vehicles traveling in platoons consume fuel at a reduced rate. In this paper, we attempt to maximize this benefit by introducing local controllers throughout a road network to facilitate platoon formations with minimal information. By knowing a vehicle's position, speed, and destination, the local controller can quickly decide how its speed should be possibly adjusted to platoon with others in the near future. We solve this optimal control and routing problem exactly for small numbers of vehicles, and present a fast heuristic algorithm for real-time use. We then implement such a distributed control system through a large-scale simulation of the German autobahn road network containing thousands of vehicles. The simulation shows fuel savings from 1-9%, with savings exceeding 5% when only a few thousand vehicles participate in the system. We assume no vehicles will travel more than the time required for their shortest paths for the majority of the paper.

{"abstract": "Calling context  enhances program understanding and dynamic analyses by providing a rich representation of program location. Compared to imperative programs, object-oriented programs use more interprocedural and less intraprocedural control flow, increasing the importance of context sensitivity for analysis. However, prior online methods for computing calling context, such as stack-walking or maintaining the current location in a calling context tree, are expensive in time and space. This paper introduces a new online approach called  probabilistic calling context  (PCC) that continuously maintains a probabilistically unique value representing the current calling context. For millions of unique contexts, a 32-bit PCC value has few conflicts. Computing the PCC value adds 3% average overhead to a Java virtual machine. PCC is well-suited to clients that detect new or anomalous behavior since PCC values from training and production runs can be compared easily to detect new context-sensitive behavior; clients that query the PCC value at every system call, Java utility call, and Java API call add 0-9% overhead on average.

{"abstract": "One of the most striking results on asset pricing in the last 20 years is the better forecastability of long-horizon returns over one-step return forecasts. This could seem a paradox, given that the further our forecast horizon the greater the uncertainty we are bound to face. This point can been found in Campbell and Shiller [Journal of Finance 43 (1988) 661; Journal of Finance 40 (1985) 793; American Economic Review 76 (1986) 1142] among others. In this paper, we offer an alternative explanation to this \"forecast paradox\" that is in agreement with Kim et al. [Review of Economic Studies 30 (1992) 25], who found that the negative serial correlation in long-horizon returns depends very much on the sample choice. Our explanation is based on the existence of simultaneous shifts in the time series of the equilibrium stock price and dividends. This explanation relies on the concept of co-breaking [D.F. Hendry, A theory of co-breaking, Mimeo, Nuffield College, Oxford, 1995.]. We put forward a stochastic present value model, in which we are able to show how shifts in the process for dividends lead to shifts in the equilibrium stock price.#R##N##R##N#This has important implications for multiperiod forecasting, as we demonstrate in this paper. An empirical application supports our results. In our empirical application, we model earning, dividends, stock prices, and the risk-free interest in the United States from 1926 to 1985. We can distinguish three different historical periods where the process for dividends and the equilibrium stock prices are characterized by different properties in terms of their means and variances. Our empirical model is extended to a forecasting exercise where the \"forecast paradox\" is solved.", "authors": ["Hans-Martin Krolzig", "Juan Toro"], "n_citation": 13, "references": [], "title": "Multiperiod forecasting in stock markets: a paradox solved", "venue": "decision support systems", "year": 2004, "id": "888b44f6-d2d5-407f-bb26-7c3320393329"}
{"abstract": "This paper proposes an adaptive sliding mode super-twisting differentiator which allows the gains to adapt based on the 'quality' of the sliding motion. A Lyapunov based analysis for the adaptive super-twisting scheme is presented to demonstrate its properties. As an example, the adaptive differentiator proposed in this paper has been used as part of a nonlinear FDI scheme for an Oscillatory Failure Case (OFC) in an actuator. The FDI scheme requires an estimate of the rod speed which is provided by the adaptive super-twisting differentiator. Due to the conditions in which the actuator operates, normally the differentiator gains are initialised at low values to ensure good rod speed estimation in fault free conditions. However for large amplitude/frequency OFCs, the gains must adapt in order to maintain sliding and provide a good estimation.

{"abstract": "This paper extends the study of online algorithms for energy-efficient deadline scheduling to the overloaded setting. Specifically, we consider a processor that can vary its speed between 0 and a maximum speed  T  to minimize its energy usage (of which the rate is roughly a cubic function of the speed). As the speed is upper bounded, the system may be overloaded with jobs and no scheduling algorithms can meet the deadlines of all jobs. An optimal schedule is expected to maximize the throughput, and furthermore, its energy usage should be the smallest among all schedules that achieve the maximum throughput. In designing a scheduling algorithm, one has to face the dilemma of selecting more jobs and being conservative in energy usage. Even if we ignore energy usage, the best possible online algorithm is 4-competitive on throughput [12]. On the other hand, existing work on energy-efficient scheduling focuses on minimizing the energy to complete all jobs on a processor with unbounded speed, giving several  O (1)-competitive algorithms with respect to the energy usage [2, 20]. This paper presents the first online algorithm for the more realistic setting where processor speed is bounded and the system may be overloaded; the algorithm is  O (1)-competitive on both throughput and energy usage. If the maximum speed of the online scheduler is relaxed slightly to (1 + e) T  for some e > 0, we can improve the competitive ratio on throughput to arbitrarily close to one, while maintaining  O (1)-competitive on energy usage.", "authors": ["Ho-Leung Chan", "Wun-Tat Chan", "Tak Wah Lam", "Lap-Kei Lee", "Kin-Sum Mak", "Prudence W.

In phase I of the SCIPHOX project the proposal specifies the use of the CDA as a generalized international standard in the national context of discharge and referral letters in Germany.

{"abstract": "Symbolic approaches to the control design over complex systems employ the construction of finite-state models that are related to the original control systems, then use techniques from finite-state synthesis to compute controllers satisfying specifications given in a temporal logic, and finally translate the synthesized schemes back as controllers for the concrete complex systems. Such approaches have been successfully developed and implemented for the synthesis of controllers over non-probabilistic control systems. In this paper, we extend the technique to probabilistic control systems modeled by controlled stochastic differential equations. We show that for every stochastic control system satisfying a probabilistic variant of incremental input-to-state stability, and for every given precision $\\varepsilon>0$, a finite-state transition system can be constructed, which is $\\varepsilon$-approximately bisimilar (in the sense of moments) to the original stochastic control system. Moreover, we provide results relating stochastic control systems to their corresponding finite-state transition systems in terms of probabilistic bisimulation relations known in the literature. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the construction by synthesizing controllers for stochastic control systems over rich specifications expressed in linear temporal logic. The discussed technique enables a new, automated, correct-by-construction controller synthesis approach for stochastic control systems, which are common mathematical models employed in many safety critical systems subject to structured uncertainty and are thus relevant for cyber-physical applications.", "authors": ["Majid Zamani", "Peyman Mohajerin Esfahani", "Rupak Majumdar", "Alessandro Abate", "John Lygeros"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0861cda3-bae4-4f1b-b782-b78cadc480f0", "0f6ca7fa-3093-464a-a049-c0a5a026d8f6", "147c2bb2-0f45-4ef9-a608-0e852371ea23", "14852300-21b1-4767-ae81-db896027d366", "1bd7bd98-d72c-479e-ba80-ae4740f1a598", "2525b40a-1d5d-42bc-ab38-93222f28fa84", "2c606544-f7ec-407d-986c-b47d7d68c973", "3023929a-c93e-49c5-b03f-7fb0414d94df", "3470d143-8868-4a58-bf3f-de2f0eab2b9a", "3f5dcb77-9464-41b8-8a5c-39dfa6586ec4", "40e20090-5cbc-4885-ba40-fbcae008bc95", "47b7262a-5719-4fe2-bb6e-1e351d159097", "5327491d-f932-4fd6-b185-2c9908a151af", "5df8d4f6-2dbd-437c-b45d-ea117de18086", "6ba9bb7f-b52c-4c81-ab45-24110ba9ca8a", "804b4514-78c7-40fb-a625-aeae061ce45c", "83269965-ffdd-48a4-b8e6-f36c0b1dcec2", "8a2b4254-4d3f-4e86-a01e-950d7afeafb2", "8b2f0d19-4930-43cc-ad53-7f35493c1f62", "8d6dc616-8728-49a3-8962-71a2530d16bc", "95dd72f4-b792-4ed4-b65a-13613d735543", "9c3d15e4-100a-4136-9ccc-c1ee48d4fb42", "9f060f78-8fb9-4d8b-b2bd-d2d28cd11f80", "a6fc595a-42dc-4c78-9805-d7b657e4a193", "ad5f3dfb-ae48-4a6b-814f-7609e198760d", "b60e6c45-3695-45b7-bca3-1d8f54d1f326", "bd644d8f-1bf9-4526-8c56-44ffbf99482d", "bedfb7d1-e874-46a4-b62e-4ac4109cf7f6", "dfefce0c-94c4-4412-b48a-c99063641fc3", "e5cbf7b7-4140-40e9-ad78-f7e9f46ab6f2", "ea20ed7f-722c-4ef7-8102-18327a13d650", "ed47661a-fbfd-4e82-b98b-cfbeac9dc141", "f5f21e70-8661-4c06-81a0-1b345f069221", "f6edeced-5448-44ff-bd1e-d223ecdab6ea"], "title": "Symbolic control of stochastic systems via approximately bisimilar finite abstractions", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "year": 2014, "id": "a32667dc-f2f3-4784-8104-06c396a947a2"}
{"abstract": "Small low-cost sensor devices with limited resources are being used widely to build a self-organizing wireless network for various applications, such as situation monitoring and asset surveillance. Making such a sensor network secure is crucial to their intended applications, yet challenging due to the severe resource constraints in each sensor device. We present a  lightweight security protocol  (LiSP) that makes a tradeoff between security and resource consumption via efficient rekeying. The heart of the protocol is the novel rekeying mechanism that offers (1) efficient key broadcast without requiring retransmission/ACKs, (2) authentication for each key-disclosure without incurring additional overhead, (3) the ability of detecting/recovering lost keys, (4) seamless key refreshment without disrupting ongoing data encryption/decryption, and (5) robustness to inter-node clock skews. Furthermore, these benefits are preserved in conventional contention-based medium access control protocols that do not support reliable broadcast. Our performance evaluation shows that LiSP reduces resource consumption significantly, while requiring only three hash computations, on average, and a storage space for eight keys.", "authors": ["Taejoon Park", "Kang G.

{"abstract": "We present two new packet routing algorithms for parallel computers with torus interconnection networks of arbitrary size and dimension. Both algorithms use only minimal length paths, are fully adaptive in the sense that all minimal length paths may be used to avoid congestion, and are free of deadlock, livelock and starvation. Algorithm 1 requires only three central queues per routing node. It is the first known minimal length packet routing algorithm for torus networks which requires a constant number of queues per node, regardless of the size and dimension of the torus. In fact, the requirement of three queues per node is optimal, as no such algorithm is possible when all nodes have two or fewer queues. Algorithm 2 requires only that each node have two input buffers per edge. It is the first known minimal-fully-adaptive packet routing algorithm for torus networks which does not require central queues and which does not require any node to have more than two input or two output buffers per edge. Both algorithms are simple and appear to be well-suited to VLSI implementation. They can be used with either store-and-forward or virtual cut-through routing. >", "authors": ["Robert Cypher", "Luis Gravano"], "n_citation": 33, "references": ["0974e4f7-f01a-4211-9871-f5be77c3ac45", "32ccdc3a-7bda-4968-9834-1364f85b2af4", "3d9e52bb-b80b-4647-ae2a-69bee3491f23", "7085d711-8e16-48b0-b559-e06249bef42b", "73739568-56c1-4153-a32c-3961d4edb81f", "76bc6e8d-7de3-40f3-9dc5-c5fddaa44f2e", "97494bc5-e0ed-4ddb-95e6-c4dc841a1e87", "988dd121-2ca7-4737-a691-548262bbdb7e", "9e878a72-ed41-492d-be2d-fca6b7769026", "b20ab917-fec5-4b77-9997-a3399f5aea24", "c629aa2c-f5ee-4dda-a86a-11955ef81277", "c89a9210-cc7d-4230-94e2-1e87de4821cb", "cc902f62-3205-4b7f-ab26-e05f39b2e0c2", "f55731e1-e7eb-4d87-b465-fd5c619ad2f1", "fcdbca21-f171-46ec-9f74-507abdca0aa3"], "title": "Storage-efficient, deadlock-free packet routing algorithms for torus networks", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Computers", "year": 1994, "id": "6477c807-0ec6-40c0-802d-eabbf207948c"}

This paper proposes to generate the SFBC encoded signals of the various antennas in time domain by exploiting the time-domain signal properties and signal correlations among the various transmitter antennas, achieving a significant reduction in computational complexity. In particular, it is demonstrated that the time domain SFBC encoded signals of the various antennas can be obtained from the time domain signal of the first antenna. Therefore, the proposed scheme requires only one IFFT irrespective of the number of transmission antennas.

{"abstract": "Describes the design and implementation of the Ariel DBMS and its tightly-coupled forward-chaining rule system. The query language of Ariel is a subset of POSTQUEL (the POSTGRES QUEry Language), extended with a new production-rule sublanguage. Ariel supports traditional relational database query and update operations efficiently, using a System R-like query processing strategy. In addition, the Ariel rule system is tightly coupled with query and update processing. Ariel rules can have conditions based on a mix of selections, joins, events and transitions. For testing rule conditions, Ariel makes use of a discrimination network composed of a special data structure for testing single-relation selection conditions efficiently, and a modified version of the TREAT algorithm, called A-TREAT, for testing join conditions. The key modification to TREAT (which could also be used in the Rete algorithm) is the use of virtual /spl alpha/-memory nodes which save storage since they contain only the predicate associated with the memory node instead of copies of data matching the predicate. In addition, the notions of tokens and /spl alpha/-memory nodes are generalized to support event and transition conditions. The rule-action executor in Ariel binds the data matching a rule's condition to the action of the rule at rule fire time, and executes the rule action using the query processor.", "authors": ["Eric N.

{"abstract": "This paper contrasts two existing type-based techniques for the analysis of authentication protocols. The former, proposed by Gordon and Jeffrey, uses dependent types for nonces and cryptographic keys to statically regulate the way that nonces are created and checked in the authentication exchange. The latter, proposed by the authors, relies on a combination of static and dynamic typing to achieve similar goals. Specifically, the type system employs dependent ciphertext types to statically define certain tags that determine the typed structure of the messages circulated in the authentication exchange. The type tags are then checked dynamically to verify that each message has the format expected at the corresponding step of the authentication exchange. This paper compares the two approaches, drawing on a translation of tagged protocols, validated by our system, into protocols that type check with Gordon and Jeffrey's system. This translation gives new insight into the tradeoffs between the two techniques, and on their relative expressiveness and precision.

{"abstract": "Automated software engineering tools (e.g., program search, concern location, code reuse, quality assessment, etc.) increasingly rely on natural language information from comments and identifiers in code. The first step in analyzing words from identifiers requires splitting identifiers into their constituent words. Unlike natural languages, where space and punctuation are used to delineate words, identifiers cannot contain spaces. One common way to split identifiers is to follow programming language naming conventions. For example, Java programmers often use camel case, where words are delineated by uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters. However, programmers also create identifiers by concatenating sequences of words together with no discernible delineation, which poses challenges to automatic identifier splitting. In this paper, we present an algorithm to automatically split identifiers into sequences of words by mining word frequencies in source code. With these word frequencies, our identifier splitter uses a scoring technique to automatically select the most appropriate partitioning for an identifier.

{"abstract": "This paper presents an approach for dealing with multi-language software systems. Much of the focus of reverse engineering tools is in analyzing software systems written in one programming language. Nowadays, the abundance of new technologies and languages used to ease application development raises new challenges for reverse engineers. Therefore, this paper focuses on finding cross-language dependencies in such diverse, heterogeneous software systems. Our approach uses source navigator extractors to produce the facts inside each language. Then, we show an example for finding Java Native Interface (JNI) dependencies between facts from Java and C/C++ code. The integrated facts are produced in GXL form, and conform to a unified schema introduced in the paper. This approach is useful from several perspectives. It illustrates how to retrieve the dependencies from software systems written in more than one programming language. Also, the generated facts conform to the GXL format, which is accepted by many reverse engineering tools. The usefulness and scalability of the approach are tested in a case study.", "authors": ["Daniel L.

{"abstract": "We first give a new definition of graph grammars, which, although following the algebraic double-pushout approach, is more general than the classical one because of the use of a graph of types where all involved graphs are mapped to. Then, we develop a process-based semantics for such (typed) graph grammars, in the line of processes as normally used for providing a semantics to Petri nets. More precisely, we represent each equivalence class of derivations as a graph process, which can be seen as an acyclic graph grammar, plus a mapping of its items onto the items of the given grammar. Finally, we show that such processes represent exactly the equivalence classes of derivations up to the well-known shift-equivalence, which have always been used in the literature on graph grammars. Therefore graph processes are attractive alternative representatives for such classes. The advantage of dealing with graph processes instead of equivalence classes (or also representatives belonging to the equivalence classes) is that dependency and/or concurrency of derivation steps is explicitly represented.", "authors": ["Andrea Corradini", "Ugo Montanari", "F.

Using this framework, it is shown that, when the schedule, i.e. the order by which operations are executed, is fixed, efficient portability is achievable. We propose (a) the decomposition-tree memory manager, which achieves time within a logarithmic factor of optimal on all HRAMs, and (b) the reoccurrence-width memory manager, which achieves time within a constant factor of optimal for the important class of uniform HRAMs.#R##N##R##N#We also show that, when the schedule is considered as a degree of freedom of the implementation, there are computations whose optimal schedule does vary with the access function.

{"abstract": "We present a method of recovering high dynamic range radiance maps from photographs taken with conventional imaging equipment. In our method, multiple photographs of the scene are taken with different amounts of exposure. Our algorithm uses these differently exposed photographs to recover the response function of the imaging process, up to factor of scale, using the assumption of reciprocity. With the known response function, the algorithm can fuse the multiple photographs into a single, high dynamic range radiance map whose pixel values are proportional to the true radiance values in the scene. We demonstrate our method on images acquired with both photochemical and digital imaging processes. We discuss how this work is applicable in many areas of computer graphics involving digitized photographs, including image-based modeling, image compositing, and image processing. Lastly, we demonstrate a few applications of having high dynamic range radiance maps, such as synthesizing realistic motion blur and simulating the response of the human visual system.", "authors": ["Paul E.

{"abstract": "Ordered attributed grammars are defined as a large subclass of semantically well-defined attributed grammars proposed by Knuth. An attributed grammar is ordered if for each symbol a partial order over the associated attributes can be given, such that in any context of the symbol the attributes are evaluable in an order which includes that partial order. The definition does not refer to a predefined strategy for attribute evaluation, e.g. several passes from left to right. For each attributed grammar evaluable by any predefined evaluation strategy such an order exists. The ordering property can be checked by an algorithm, which depends polynomially in time on the size of the input grammar. \"Visit-sequences\" are computed from the attribute dependencies given by an ordered attributed grammar.

{"abstract": "An efficient discontinuity handling algorithm for initial value problems in differential-algebraic equations is presented. The algorithm supports flexible representation of state conditions in propositional logic, and guarantees the location of all state events in strict time order. The algorithm consists of two phases:(1) event detection and(2) consistent event location. In the event detection phase, the entire integration step is searched for the state event by solving the interpolation polynomials for the discontinuity functions generated by the BDF method. An efficient hierarchical polynomial root-finding procedure based upon interval arithmetic guarantees detection of the state event even if multiple state condition transitions exist in an integration step, in which case many  existing algorithms may fail. As a second phase of the algorithm, a consistent even location calculation is developed that accurately locates the state event detected earlier while completely eliminating incorrect reactivation of the same state event immediately after the consistent initialization calculation that may follow. This numerical phenomenon has not been explained before and is termed  discontinuity sticking . Results from various test problems are presented to demonstrate the correctness and efficiency of the algorithm.", "authors": ["Taeshin Park", "Paul I.

{"abstract": "In this paper, in order to deal with training data corrupted by noise or rule uncertainties, a new observer-based indirect adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy controller is developed for nonlinear MIMO systems involving external disturbances using fuzzy descriptions to model the plant. Based on the universal approximation theorem, a fuzzy logic controller equipped with a training algorithm is proposed such that the tracking error, because of the matching error and external disturbance, is attenuated to an arbitrary desired level using the H^~ tracking design technique. Simulation results show that the interval type-2 fuzzy logic system can handle unpredicted internal disturbances-data uncertainties, very well, but the adaptive type-1 fuzzy controller must expend more control effort in order to handle noisy training data. In the meantime, the adaptive fuzzy controller can perform successful control and guarantee that the global stability of the resulting closed-loop system and the tracking performance can be achieved.", "authors": ["Tsung-Chih Lin"], "n_citation": 67, "references": ["0b118860-2fc9-4484-b480-391f64763f9b", "0ca5670c-1427-4dd1-aebb-884ef314356f", "147c2fee-b6ab-4f09-9aa9-fae3a66853a8", "202fd909-f594-48c8-8f83-f78d062a7283", "3c9f64b9-ff1e-4e9f-8307-5d1243a51a90", "3faa6244-4283-4ece-b8f4-3ffe32b7653d", "41f11a83-893b-499a-9044-12a007b426ee", "7c7771a3-635a-4aea-9746-c25d11aa4244", "8ed2f67e-d7be-4923-9709-806a49cb3432", "8f2914b6-ad7d-42b1-ab04-687d7c35e6fc", "99c5bf89-84e8-4e74-8f3f-0cea881a6053", "af13dab4-91a7-49cc-af85-fa69ec068d5d", "b1458a1c-7482-4e92-8406-b2d20d18b793", "b4f975cc-b99c-49ba-beb8-6818cc40bbc7", "c9cb95c4-b3d8-41a7-9ddf-9c0362917d6e", "cc114ec4-55f1-4455-84a7-9793f10cca89", "cefca33d-f02e-4897-ab24-78405df7b7ce", "dff97397-5bf9-47c4-b4c5-96f23cdd91ff", "e65ac882-26a9-4284-bbbf-43f0308b6123"], "title": "Observer-based robust adaptive interval type-2 fuzzy tracking control of multivariable nonlinear systems", "venue": "Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence", "year": 2010, "id": "0dea3376-b9e5-432f-b1b0-2de24bc445c1"}
{"abstract": "The objective of a multidatabase system is to provide a single uniform interface to accessing multiple independent databases being managed by multiple independent, and possibly heterogeneous, database systems. One crucial element in the design of a multidatabase system is the design of a data definition language for specifying a schema that represents the integration of the schemas of multiple independent databases. The design of such a language in turn requires a comprehensive classification of the conflicts (i.e., discrepancies) among the schemas of the independent databases and development of techniques for resolving (i.e., homogenizing) all of the conflicts in the classification. An earlier paper provided a comprehensive classification of schematic conflicts that may arise when integrating multiple independent relational database (RDB) schemas into a single multidatabase (MDB) schema. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive classification of techniques for resolving the schematic conflicts that may arise when integrating multiple RDB schemas, or RDB schemas and object-oriented database (OODB) schemas, or multiple OODB schemas. The classification of conflict resolution techniques includes not only those necessary for resolving schematic conflicts identified in the earlier paper, but also additional conflicts that arise when OODBs become part of the databases to be integrated. Most of the conflict resolution techniques discussed in the paper have already been incorporated into SQL/M, a multidatabase language implemented in UniSQL/M, a commercially available multidatabase system from UniSQL, Inc. which integrated SQL-based relational database systems and the UniSQL/X unified relational and object-oriented database system.", "authors": ["Won Kim", "Injun Choi", "Sunit K.

{"abstract": "Many scientific and high-performance computing applications consist of multiple processes running on different processors that communicate frequently. Because of their synchronization needs, these applications can suffer severe performance penalties if their processes are not all coscheduled to run together. Two common approaches to coscheduling jobs are batch scheduling, wherein nodes are dedicated for the duration of the run, and gang scheduling, wherein time slicing is coordinated across processors. Both work well when jobs are load-balanced and make use of the entire parallel machine. However, these conditions are rarely met and most realistic workloads consequently suffer from both internal and external fragmentation, in which resources and processors are left idle because jobs cannot be packed with perfect efficiency. This situation leads to reduced utilization and suboptimal performance. Flexible coscheduling (FCS) addresses this problem by monitoring each job's computation granularity and communication pattern and scheduling jobs based on their synchronization and load-balancing requirements. In particular, jobs that do not require stringent synchronization are identified, and are not coscheduled; instead, these processes are used to reduce fragmentation. FCS has been fully implemented on top of the STORM resource manager on a 256-processor alpha cluster and compared to batch, gang, and implicit coscheduling algorithms. This paper describes in detail the implementation of FCS and its performance evaluation with a variety of workloads, including large-scale benchmarks, scientific applications, and dynamic workloads. The experimental results show that FCS saturates at higher loads than other algorithms (up to 54 percent higher in some cases), and displays lower response times and slowdown than the other algorithms in nearly all scenarios.", "authors": ["Eitan Frachtenberg", "G.

{"abstract": "How to predict stock price movements based on quantitative market data modeling is an attractive topic. In front of the market news and stock prices that are commonly believed as two important market data sources, how to extract and exploit the hidden information within the raw data and make both accurate and fast predictions simultaneously becomes a challenging problem. In this paper, we present the design and architecture of our trading signal mining platform that employs extreme learning machine (ELM) to make stock price prediction based on those two data sources concurrently. Comprehensive experimental comparisons between ELM and the state-of-the-art learning algorithms, including support vector machine (SVM) and back-propagation neural network (BP-NN), have been undertaken on the intra-day tick-by-tick data of the H-share market and contemporaneous news archives. The results have shown that (1) both RBF ELM and RBF SVM achieve higher prediction accuracy and faster prediction speed than BP-NN; (2) the RBF ELM achieves similar accuracy with the RBF SVM and (3) the RBF ELM has faster prediction speed than the RBF SVM.

{"abstract": "Ad hoc networks are completely wireless networks of mobile hosts, in which the topology rapidly changes due to the movement of mobile hosts. This frequent topology change may lead to sudden packet losses and delays. Transport protocols like TCP, which have been designed for reliable fixed networks, misinterpret this packet loss as congestion and invoke congestion control, leading to unnecessary retransmissions and loss of throughput. To overcome this problem, a feedback scheme is proposed so that the source can distinguish between a route failure and network congestion. When a route is disrupted, the source is sent a route failure notification packet, allowing it to invalidate its timers and stop sending packets. When the route is reestablished, the source is informed through a route reestablishment notification packet, upon which it resumes packet transmissions. Simulation experiments show that in the event of route failures, as the route reestablishment time increases, the use of feedback provides significant improvements in performance.", "authors": ["Kartik Chandran", "Sudarshan Raghunathan", "S.

{"abstract": "Many cluster based replication solutions have been proposed providing scalability and fault-tolerance. Many of these solutions perform replica control in a middleware on top of the database replicas. In such a setting concurrency control is a challenge and is often performed on a table basis. Additionally, some systems put severe requirements on transaction programs (e.g., to declare all objects to be accessed in advance). This paper addresses these issues and presents a middleware-based replication scheme which provides the popular snapshot isolation level at the same tuple-level granularity as database systems like PostgreSQL and Oracle, without any need to declare transaction properties in advance. Both read-only and update transactions can be executed at any replica while providing data consistency at all times. Our approach provides what we call \"1-copy-snapshot-isolation\" as long as the underlying database replicas provide snapshot isolation. We have implemented our approach as a replicated middleware on top of PostgreSQL replicas. By providing a standard JDBC interface, the middleware is completely transparent to the client program. Fault-tolerance is provided by automatically reconnecting clients in case of crashes.

The interests of this computation rely on the excellent classification rate obtained with this method and also on using this Fourier\u2013Mellin transform within a \u201cfiltering mode\u201d, with which we can solve the well known difficult problem of connected character recognition.", "authors": ["S\u00e9bastien Adam", "Jean-Marc Ogier", "Claude Cariou", "R\u00e9my Mullot", "Jacques Labiche", "Jo\u00ebl Gardes"], "n_citation": 84, "references": ["0116e17f-8aff-48d3-a26e-cddb68ebb33d", "04263041-e3e9-4353-9bda-5b5e458158d6", "0a59a768-e704-4b4e-8757-f1f3f22c3a58", "0e30c8d3-74fa-458b-8b21-40fdb9a3a7fd", "10e79be8-aa4c-44e8-8d60-fd6700d861d2", "1737c7a2-91b5-4749-ac70-f05b5faf7685", "1c395e3a-0ec3-4eef-8742-4a7b769fa54e", "214fdd2f-31eb-46bf-a93c-ac359683a072", "24a59f34-fac7-461d-b5cd-10862aa262f2", "2d8ede40-22cf-481d-ba68-35935b931318", "35a62404-7b64-4ddf-9c46-115b6ba5e75f", "39e24752-e727-4e89-aa94-156443102233", "43270628-6daf-4e14-b768-e9d0be3b729f", "4c0ae3e7-45b4-441e-81b2-7b325af64e32", "4de9dd10-b701-40b8-8852-338c5b13b81a", "5b071928-7b0b-42f4-a73d-3f5dfc5cf517", "65b66204-b06e-4ed9-982c-e61cabd8bc95", "67bc9998-513a-4b3c-a9fc-89f19b19281f", "68741c78-6856-4d2d-80d2-56d4cb2d0c00", "693a1be9-5e0a-4cf2-a4a5-6b64f90d78f3", "7f520a86-78e8-4244-945e-4ce4b2ca9992", "859451a6-6c62-440d-ac29-02349e664b33", "8a779244-b58d-41da-b86c-605100eeeee0", "9348c4ae-723b-4ba9-a433-f888e8d09698", "9b080caa-3719-461a-a1ac-83c67b05783d", "9cac58c3-6345-4b97-bae3-135206e57fd1", "9dfd81c6-3dea-4e56-bbc9-80377e397979", "a0affaec-fe08-468b-bf53-21d7b05c7cbb", "bef773d3-b61f-4f5e-a37e-8c1a2272e760", "ca05f48e-feee-4640-8ac2-60a6f304ac19", "cb69aca9-925c-494f-abc0-27f31f85099a", "d04c4f43-6e3c-4a45-b8ae-444f551402f4", "d075f8ce-75aa-4723-87cc-8c8b07ed3b86", "d0b50d7b-2041-4927-9989-8062c9ad984e", "f8fc3297-a97a-4407-ab78-3a65197fc9bd", "fcb900b0-3f7b-49f0-8653-801756e076e7", "fcf0315d-052e-495b-acdf-810fdfdb2b2d"], "title": "Symbol and character recognition : application to engineering drawings", "venue": "International Journal on Document Analysis and Recognition", "year": 2000, "id": "ecb7b726-af35-47fe-b7b1-7213f4f9a383"}
{"abstract": "The notion of bisimulation in theoretical computer science is one of the main complexity reduction methods for the analysis and synthesis of labeled transition systems. Bisimulations are special quotients of the state space that preserve many important properties expressible in temporal logics, and, in particular, reachability. In this paper, the framework of bisimilar transition systems is applied to various transition systems that are generated by linear control systems. Given a discrete-time or continuous-time linear system, and a finite observation map, we characterize linear quotient maps that result in quotient transition systems that are bisimilar to the original system. Interestingly, the characterizations for discrete-time systems are more restrictive than for continuous-time systems, due to the existence of an atomic time step. We show that computing the coarsest bisimulation, which results in maximum complexity reduction, corresponds to computing the maximal controlled or reachability invariant subspace inside the kernel of the observations map. These results establish strong connections between complexity reduction concepts in control theory and computer science.", "authors": ["George J.

{"abstract": "The completeness, stability, and application to pattern recognition of a multiscale representation based on zero-crossings is discussed. An alternative projection algorithm is described that reconstructs a signal from a zero-crossing representation, which is stabilized by keeping the value of the wavelet transform integral between each pair of consecutive zero-crossings. The reconstruction algorithm has a fast convergence and each iteration requires O(N log/sup 2/ (N)) computation for a signal of N samples. The zero-crossings of a wavelet transform define a representation which is particularly well adapted for solving pattern recognition problems. As an example, the implementation and results of a coarse-to-fine stereo-matching algorithm are described. >", "authors": ["St\u00e9phane Mallat"], "n_citation": 1050, "references": ["093cf9fe-6fda-4495-9e89-acef614d0453", "15a2345f-3667-4fde-b64e-30471b6ae9ee", "1f9d7a5e-606c-4c53-80bc-196fa87cfdcf", "2fa2e5ba-11d3-4691-91e1-807b8ef7d8a5", "3f0bc2c9-a5c2-4e4c-a4e9-7631e36bc6a3", "7ccbdf09-a84e-4ad2-ab20-cb28b6c41155", "7d5e97d2-5ebe-4be2-ac67-3c15fcde2c8d", "9b3a14e6-eaff-46ce-8d6e-d9519258ed0c", "ee3fa7f4-a88d-4b58-8ee8-843370ed51be", "f61e51da-1c22-4139-8758-8830e0be9be1", "f75dafe6-36e1-4221-99a6-24f691aee179"], "title": "Zero-crossings of a wavelet transform", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "year": 1991, "id": "213718b6-e2da-4cbf-b47a-f3734e19e294"}

We first show that an integer linear programming model can be used to minimize testing time for a given hardware overhead, for example, droplet dispensing sources and capacitive sensing circuitry. Due to the NP-complete nature of the problem, we also develop efficient heuristic procedures to solve this optimization problem. We apply the proposed concurrent testing methodology to a droplet-based microfluidic array that was fabricated and used to perform multiplexed glucose and lactate assays.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a novel multicast route discovery scheme for wireless networks, satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints such as bandwidth requirement and end-to-end delay guarantees. The underlying approach is based on a genetic algorithm (GA). The problem of (optimal) multicast route discovery is NP-hard when the network state information is inaccurate, which is so common in the wireless domain. In general, this makes it difficult to determine multicast routes on demand, and hence the network resources are never used to their full potential. The proposed GA based method, however, is shown to discover multicast routes for large networks within few iterations, even with imprecise network information, and thus it ran be used for an on-demand basis. We observed an approximate linear relationship between the computation time and the number of nodes in a network. In addition we have studied the effects of choosing the fitness function of the GA.", "authors": ["Nilanjan Banerjee", "Sajal K.

{"abstract": "Software developers submit patches to handle tens or even hundreds of bugs reported daily. However, not all submitted patches can be directly integrated into the code base, since they might not pass patch review that is adopted in most software projects. As the result of patch review, incoming patches can be rejected or asked for resubmission after improvement. Both scenarios interrupt the workflow of patch writers and reviewers, increase their workload, and potentially delay the general development process. In this paper, we aim to help developers write acceptable patches to avoid patch rejection and resubmission. To this end, we derive a comprehensive list of patch rejection reasons from a manual inspection of 300 rejected Eclipse and Mozilla patches, a large-scale online survey of Eclipse and Mozilla developers, and the literature. We also investigate which patch-rejection reasons are more decisive and which are difficult to judge from the perspective of patch reviewers. Our findings include 1) suboptimal solution and incomplete fix are the most frequent patch-rejection reasons 2) whether a patch introduces new bugs is very important yet very difficult to judge 3) reviewers reject a large patch not solely because of its size, but mainly because of the underlying reasons that induce its large size, such as the involvement of unnecessary changes 4) reviewers consider certain problems to be much more destructive than patch writers expect, such as the inconsistency of documentation in a patch and 5) bad timing of patch submission and a lack of communication with team members can also result in a negative patch review.", "authors": ["Yida Tao", "Donggyun Han", "Sunghun Kim"], "n_citation": 18, "references": ["0f5fc2db-6621-46e1-8d8c-f82855eefb5d", "183f24bb-8cf9-498b-9aaf-0771eaf3645c", "1c12f141-7f5f-468e-9db3-30a12a6dfa93", "27f6f4fc-f788-4ec8-8281-0dd4ed400fc0", "2f79c6f1-215e-4346-add9-55f76e1cae45", "420181ab-aed1-49c0-aa72-a432e4423b43", "4b81405a-2392-4939-bc38-462323c26434", "52c2dfee-c020-422e-9160-93990f2ea43b", "53be7980-931e-456f-90b4-2c37d676c2d6", "54bb1dd4-e4dc-4952-ace7-b7d25948cf34", "5ed0c7ab-6793-48d4-a3f4-ff5b8a299b64", "69600b36-97cb-4251-aa38-f7b719bb11ad", "6abfc566-b718-4d0e-b276-821f5475f22f", "71d05d9d-a7d4-463d-ad6e-69ad70a9efdf", "771444e0-49d2-4865-af3a-052960150545", "7eb9832b-5093-4e29-baa0-a50e825bd24f", "93d5fb9e-cec8-442f-8152-bc8c29813a3d", "95c64481-1f19-4b1b-b09f-4b45d32deb7a", "9bb5c967-d121-41a4-bfc5-b7817a571310", "a7dfded5-1d25-49f8-a3e9-e7c3402f5ff5", "b01a8684-4324-41c0-ae95-b78ee2d56201", "b1c3e7ff-82df-49a4-a64f-28ae8aae34ee", "bc30931a-6b23-4bc8-ac27-06c2dca066a9", "d8ab6b10-bed8-4f5d-8a4c-21a3432797a9", "dcf9c824-1035-4e3c-a995-994c00a791c3", "f907d596-64da-41ca-a8e6-556c4f48175a"], "title": "Writing Acceptable Patches: An Empirical Study of Open Source Project Patches", "venue": "international conference on software maintenance", "year": 2014, "id": "0dc7991f-16f5-45c9-890a-b50a06629cae"}
{"abstract": "The Chemical Master Equation (CME) is a cornerstone of stochastic analysis and simulation of models of biochemical reaction networks. Yet direct solutions of the CME have remained elusive. Although several approaches overcome the infinite dimensional nature of the CME through projections or other means, a common feature of proposed approaches is their susceptibility to the curse of dimensionality, i.e. the exponential growth in memory and computational requirements in the number of problem dimensions. We present a novel approach that has the potential to \u201clift\u201d this curse of dimensionality. The approach is based on the use of the recently proposed Quantized Tensor Train (QTT) formatted numerical linear algebra for the low parametric, numerical representation of tensors. The QTT decomposition admits both, algorithms for basic tensor arithmetics with complexity scaling linearly in the dimension (number of species) and sub-linearly in the mode size (maximum copy number), and a numerical tensor rounding procedure which is stable and quasi-optimal. We show how the CME can be represented in QTT format, then use the exponentially-converging -discontinuous Galerkin discretization in time to reduce the CME evolution problem to a set of QTT-structured linear equations to be solved at each time step using an algorithm based on Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) methods from quantum chemistry. Our method automatically adapts the \u201cbasis\u201d of the solution at every time step guaranteeing that it is large enough to capture the dynamics of interest but no larger than necessary, as this would increase the computational complexity. Our approach is demonstrated by applying it to three different examples from systems biology: independent birth-death process, an example of enzymatic futile cycle, and a stochastic switch model. The numerical results on these examples demonstrate that the proposed QTT method achieves dramatic speedups and several orders of magnitude storage savings over direct approaches.", "authors": ["Vladimir Kazeev", "Mustafa Khammash", "Michael Nip", "Christoph Schwab"], "n_citation": 88, "references": ["00f5cd4a-92da-4b2a-84a7-a701003c6e6e", "079ac902-c5cc-492a-a8c9-961610a61211", "08fe820d-f6a8-4094-b01a-d6fcf3edf951", "15aa10e3-e4f3-4275-b082-3f999cca8f89", "237c4c64-5a25-45e4-a9e4-dd121f176d7c", "2c9d0ac0-7c87-41ab-b1b9-5bad049785e4", "31acef28-d9c8-4427-bef5-2fe53fbff64c", "3a2140f5-9392-405b-9899-907734f73e4b", "3ddb1f82-9d4b-4d08-9b5e-7dad19174cc9", "4edfeec8-3b73-4f11-90b1-a5c5595af967", "5dce6e47-12d8-4175-9ff0-fa031cfdd84f", "6e96a768-357b-4a8e-ace3-fd31dee997b6", "75443ba9-f2b3-41af-9c39-2a81d8f7d2f8", "75951c61-a613-4fa1-aa06-92507534d559", "7a66e5e1-447c-4ac9-b1fc-6236b56271ec", "833fe13e-13b4-4fa4-9cae-5dc7b55602d2", "8b4a5793-2344-4ce2-91cf-8cb1ff0d592a", "90c87e50-502b-4b39-b217-2e33efb0be0e", "a263345b-a860-41fb-94b0-f53f3fc571fa", "a503ec6b-3871-4e28-ba9c-7ebd9183fd59", "d687547b-04d5-4857-8553-54b268c14f5f", "eabd1e13-a20f-4051-b1fa-870e4cd96458", "f5613313-1e37-4117-a1b8-1f7173d702b1"], "title": "Direct Solution of the Chemical Master Equation Using Quantized Tensor Trains", "venue": "PLOS Computational Biology", "year": 2014, "id": "bc525300-acf3-43c4-a586-aaeadac69a90"}

{"abstract": "Route maps, which depict a path from one location to another, have emerged as one of the most popular applications on the Web. Current computer-generated route maps, however, are often very difficult to use. In this paper we present a set of cartographic generalization techniques specifically designed to improve the usability of route maps. Our generalization techniques are based both on cognitive psychology research studying how route maps are used and on an analysis of the generalizations commonly found in handdrawn route maps. We describe algorithmic implementations of these generalization techniques within LineDrive, a real-time system for automatically designing and rendering route maps.

The proposed algorithm guarantees an optimal response time while ensuring data consistency at system quiescence.

Instead, direct dependency relations between generated operations as well as operation transformation mechanism are used. The coupling of the above two mentioned mechanisms is shown to realize a good trade-off between the different requirements of groupware applications.

{"abstract": "Task scheduling is an integrated component of computing. With the emergence of Grid and ubiquitous computing, new challenges appear in task scheduling based on properties such as security, quality of service, and lack of central control within distributed administrative domains. A Grid task scheduling framework must be able to deal with these issues. One of the goals of Grid task scheduling is to achieve high system throughput while matching applications with the available computing resources. This matching of resources in a nondeterministically shared heterogeneous environment leads to concerns over Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper a novel QoS guided task scheduling algorithm for Grid computing is introduced. The proposed novel algorithm is based on a general adaptive scheduling heuristics that includes QoS guidance. The algorithm is evaluated within a simulated Grid environment. The experimental results show that the new QoS guided Min-Min heuristic can lead to significant performance gain for a variety of applications.

At each step of the general usage model of OMI, the indicators are used to pinpoint improvement potential for increasing the perceived usefulness and asking the user for specific improvement suggestions where feasible.", "authors": ["Klaus-Dieter Althoff", "Markus Nick", "Carsten Tautz"], "n_citation": 9, "references": ["05598247-86d0-4ce0-b47c-eb6b3f53613a", "09be9fdb-e6a3-48d2-ac93-a4849b6e4f63", "27faf38d-a1be-46e7-bfa9-842b3ca2e380", "31fd571f-51d9-4328-a6d8-68df6d99be0b", "424d775f-b5d6-419f-a791-67e510e86e01", "48bc4ec6-d810-46e4-8f59-76d5c4385135", "4fe3d9ff-4ae4-4728-80d4-1d04d76a22f4", "558d055b-ff27-4a6c-bb89-6db8aa3743d1", "5f498a7f-d23c-488b-9c2b-e15991ce1327", "73c22ab7-28d1-49f1-8a30-22c27ab05040", "83d54f51-723b-4ab2-9ef7-b844797dacc1", "841849a5-fa9f-474e-8230-d9178efad5f5", "968281aa-1128-4459-815a-f7aa0b3e61c7", "97c39448-08ae-4ad2-a6e8-9bcf02b52332", "a8743d27-1912-424a-a24b-3b670d3c15c3", "e4c34dce-e8e7-449f-a38a-d8b6ca619242", "e75d8e62-a86d-4241-953f-1b315005d920", "e78b1eb3-b952-4dc8-954b-f47ee18d916a"], "title": "Systematically Diagnosing and Improving the Perceived Usefulness of Organizational Memories", "venue": "software engineering and knowledge engineering", "year": 1999, "id": "6f8a1f04-1a1b-43db-abdf-41cca0aeaf6b"}

{"abstract": "This article presents a successfully developed methodology for mining physiological conditions from heart rate variability (HRV) analysis. The application of HRV analysis in both research and clinical settings has seen rapid development in the past decades. Unlike previous research, this study employed features derived from longterm monitoring of HRV indices, as these trends can best reflect the autonomic nervous system dynamics influenced by various physiological conditions. We proposed two methods for mining physiological conditions from HRV trends: a decision-tree learning method and a hybrid learning method that combines feature selection, feature extraction, and classifier construction processes. The proposed methods have been validated through a clinical case study: severity classification for Parkinson's disease. Our approach yielded classification accuracy greater than 90.0%, and high sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV).", "authors": ["Che-Wei Lin", "J.

{"abstract": "When people use computer-based tools to find answers to general questions, they often are faced with a daunting list of search results or \"hits\" returned by the search engine. Many search tools address this problem by helping users to make their searches more specific. However, when dozens or hundreds of documents are relevant to their question, users need tools that help them to explore and to understand their search results, rather than ones that eliminate a portion of those results. In this paper, we present DynaCat, a tool that dynamically categorizes search results into a hierarchical organization by using knowledge of important kinds of queries and a model of the domain terminology.

{"abstract": "Channel estimation is an important issue for wireless communication systems. A channel estimation scheme using a Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy-based Kalman filter under the time-varying velocity of the mobile station in a multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) system is proposed in this paper. The fuzzy technique is used to interpolate several linear models to approximate the nonlinear estimation system. A MIMO system with the orthogonal space-time block coding (OSTBC) scheme is considered, where the radio channel is modeled as an autoregressive (AR) random process. The parameters of the AR process and the channel gain are simultaneously estimated by the proposed method. One-step-ahead prediction can be obtained during this estimation procedure. This is useful for the decision-directed channel-tracking design, particularly in the fast-fading channel. Furthermore, the robust minimum mean-square error (MMSE) equalization design can be achieved by considering the channel prediction error to improve the performance of symbol detection. To validate the performance of our proposed method, several simulation results are given and compared with those of other methods. When considering the time-varying velocity of the mobile station communication in the MIMO-OFDM system, the enhanced equalizer based on the T-S fuzzy-based Kalman filter performs better than those based on the conventional channel estimators in terms of symbol error rate.", "authors": ["Bor-Sen Chen", "Chang-Yi Yang", "Wei-Ji Liao"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["036ef4f8-69cd-4b77-945d-bf643d4d7b8e", "0729d003-ac6b-4e11-8364-b6886ccf9531", "08dfd689-8a5b-453b-a5f6-a6b79a8be8c6", "16dff149-09f5-4f4c-8a20-cdc88e2135f8", "21a6810a-5406-474e-a506-e96bc75d7dbb", "2659531e-eb9d-4dd5-b46f-10f66a4819c6", "324c0cc6-829c-4b4f-8ef4-5f2d9b34bf58", "35db5df4-82bf-4b98-b663-76d9a779fc9c", "4379f10d-18c3-4baf-9ae7-6787787c7138", "4ed070ca-59b5-435d-8d0d-a6c89f5b4b80", "58b1ebe0-67d0-4275-8eeb-0f62212f7433", "62934400-fbef-4fd6-80e6-32920f068a36", "75b5f7f4-4609-4176-9381-35d8bb606dd2", "7a32e47a-e78a-452b-ad10-0bb204bc9cd3", "93e15e38-999a-4066-937a-c4d94ae8f937", "9463aa85-a712-4b0f-aafd-9795cd695b86", "94b9473a-badc-433d-b12a-1bcae7e6c9da", "9a55344c-9e54-46a6-8f78-040e05d347d5", "9dc4dadc-ab1d-49cc-95e6-4f76c8630afc", "ab8107e0-bc53-4763-87e3-fce989118459", "b571dc3c-abb7-474a-b0fd-f0504f158aae", "b87ceee6-fc9f-469f-b743-bdb6565e3778", "d42b1c3b-a061-4990-9bec-a73e98cf023c", "d71d3833-8d9b-4c7e-8589-d6a51093d3f5", "e07c17af-995e-477a-9808-cb8ef7f8d7e1", "ec0856ea-a09b-4603-bcdb-649f276e2514", "ec629383-cfb2-446b-9602-dee07791ea2a", "ed0ca216-53a8-48b2-a966-c33b1bfccea2", "efdc1e05-3d0d-4e08-8d00-f1fc8603095d", "ff51ece9-2951-43e6-aae6-07b00256311b"], "title": "Robust Fast Time-Varying Multipath Fading Channel Estimation and Equalization for MIMO-OFDM Systems via a Fuzzy Method", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "year": 2012, "id": "bacc8ead-93e7-4a86-b2e9-b93f3ab529a6"}

The proposed step construction generates VCS OR  and VCS XOR  which have optimal pixel expansion and contrast for each qualified set in the general access structure in most cases.

{"abstract": "This paper describes the XSB system, and its use as an in-memory deductive database engine. XSB began from a Prolog foundation, and traditional Prolog systems are known to have serious deficiencies when used as database systems. Accordingly, XSB has a fundamental bottom-up extension, introduced through tabling (or memoing)[4], which makes it appropriate as an underlying query engine for deductive database systems. Because it eliminates redundant computation, the tabling extension makes XSB able to compute all modularly stratified datalog programs finitely and with polynomial data complexity. For non-stratified programs, a meta-interpreter with the same properties is provided. In addition XSB significantly extends and improves the indexing capabilities over those of standard Prolog.  Finally, its syntactic basis in HiLog [2], lends it flexibility for data modelling.  The implementation of XSB derives from the WAM [25], the most common Prolog engine. XSB inherits the WAM's efficiency and can take advantage of extensive compiler technology developed for Prolog. As a result, performance comparisons indicate that XSB is significantly faster than other deductive database systems for a wide range of queries and stratified rule sets.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes generalized features of various handwriting in forensic documents for writer identification. In forensic documents, graphologies need to scrutinize, analyze and evaluate the features of suspected authors from questioned handwriting and compared these documents with the original handwriting. This is due to the uniqueness of the shape and style of handwriting that can be used for author's authentication. In this study, by acquiring the individuality features from these question documents will lead to the proposed concept of Authorship Invarianceness.

{"abstract": "The persistency of excitation property is crucial for the stability analysis of parameter identification algorithms and adaptive control loops. We propose a relaxed definition of persistency of excitation and we use it to establish uniform global asymptotic stability (UGAS) for a large class of nonlinear, time-varying systems. Our relaxed definition is conceptually equivalent to the definition introduced in Loria et al. (1999), but is easier to verify. It is useful for stability analysis of nonlinear systems that arise, for example, in nonlinear adaptive control, stabilization of nonholonomic systems, and tracking control. Our proof of UGAS relies on some integral characterizations of UGAS established in Teel et al. (2000).

Our method allows the agents to agree on the relative location of the network centroid respect to themselves, on a common reference frame and therefore on a common heading. Using this information a global positioning system for the agents using only local measurements can be achieved. In the proposed scenario, an agent is able to sense the distance between itself and its neighbors and the direction in which it sees its neighbors with respect to its local reference frame. Furthermore only point-to-point asynchronous communications between neighboring agents are allowed thus achieving robustness against random communication failures.

{"abstract": "In real-world regression analysis, statistical data may be linguistically imprecise or vague. Given the co-existence of stochastic and fuzzy uncertainty, real data cannot be characterized by using only the formalism of random variables. In order to address regression problems in the presence of such hybrid uncertain data, fuzzy random variables are introduced in this study to serve as an integral component of regression models. A new class of fuzzy regression models that is based on fuzzy random data is built, and is called the confidence-interval-based fuzzy random regression model (CI-FRRM). First, a general fuzzy regression model for fuzzy random data is introduced. Then, using expectations and variances of fuzzy random variables, sigma-confidence intervals are constructed for fuzzy random input-output data. The CI-FRRM is established based on the sigma-confidence intervals. The proposed regression model gives rise to a nonlinear programming problem that consists of fuzzy numbers or interval numbers. Since sign changes in the fuzzy coefficients modify the entire programming structure of the solution process, the inherent dynamic nonlinearity of this optimization makes it difficult to exploit the techniques of linear programming or classical nonlinear programming. Therefore, we resort to some heuristics.

Unlike previous learning approaches for neural network ensembles, negative correlation learning attempts to train individual networks in an ensemble and combines them in the same learning process. In negative correlation learning, all the individual networks in the ensemble are trained simultaneously and interactively through the correlation penalty terms in their error functions. Rather than producing unbiased individual networks whose errors are uncorrelated, negative correlation learning can create negatively correlated networks to encourage specialisation and cooperation among the individual networks.

In this paper we define and characterize the information spaces of very simple robots, called Bitbots, which have severe sensor limitations. While complete estimation of the robot's state is impossible, careful consideration and management of the uncertainty is presented as a search in the information space. We show that these simple robots can solve several challenging online problems, even though they can neither obtain a complete map of their environment nor exactly localize themselves.

{"abstract": "We present an efficient indexing method to locate 1-dimensional subsequences within a collection of sequences, such that the subsequences match a given (query) pattern within a specified tolerance. The idea is to map each data sequences into a small set of multidimensional rectangles in feature space. Then, these rectangles can be readily indexed using traditional spatial access methods, like the R*-tree [9]. In more detail, we use a sliding window over the data sequence and extract its features; the result is a trail in feature space. We propose an efficient and effective algorithm to divide such trails into sub-trails, which  are subsequently represented by their Minimum Bounding Rectangles (MBRs). We also examine queries of varying lengths, and we show how to handle each case efficiently. We implemented our method and carried out experiments on synthetic and real data (stock price movements). We compared the method to sequential scanning, which is the only obvious competitor. The results were excellent: our method accelerated the search time from 3 times up to 100 times.", "authors": ["Christos Faloutsos", "M.

{"abstract": "Relative fitness is a new black-box approach to modeling the performance of storage devices. In contrast with an absolute model that predicts the performance of a workload on a given storage device, a relative fitness model predicts performance  differences  between a pair of devices. There are two primary advantages to this approach. First, because are lative fitness model is constructed for a device pair, the application-device feedback of a closed workload can be captured (e.g., how the I/O arrival rate changes as the workload moves from device A to device B). Second, a relative fitness model allows performance and resource utilization to be used in place of workload characteristics. This is beneficial when workload characteristics are difficult to obtain or concisely express (e.g., rather than describe the spatio-temporal characteristics of a workload, one could use the observed cache behavior of device A to help predict the performance of B.   This paper describes the steps necessary to build a relative fitness model, with an approach that is general enough to be used with any black-box modeling technique. We compare relative fitness models and absolute models across a variety of workloads and storage devices. On average, relative fitness models predict bandwidth and throughput within 10-20% and can reduce prediction error by as much as a factor of two when compared to absolute models.", "authors": ["Michael P.

{"abstract": "The concept of depth from focus involves calculating distances to points in an observed scene by modeling the effect that the camera's focal parameters have on images acquired with a small depth of field. This technique is passive and requires only a single camera. The most difficult segment of calculating depth from focus is deconvolving the defocus operator from the scene and modeling it. Most current methods for determining the defocus operator employ inverse filtering. The authors reveal some fundamental problems with inverse filtering: inaccuracies in finding the frequency domain representation, windowing effects, and border effects. A general, matrix-based method using regularization is presented, which eliminates these problems. The new method is confirmed experimentally, with the results showing an RMS error of 1.3%. >", "authors": ["John Ens", "P S Lawrence"], "n_citation": 435, "references": ["10cb055f-9254-4a5b-9e75-2bc459163af7", "29ecc228-9e3d-4c81-8c87-250bd27a9675", "c9fa31f7-f6ce-49ea-b42c-8d03ae59dbe4", "cb632bb1-6bd8-4b43-bda0-435c339591f2"], "title": "An investigation of methods for determining depth from focus", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": 1993, "id": "9fe22fff-431a-4343-b4fb-74de6f2fabf8"}

We propose in this paper a new mathematical model of a flow network, different from that introduced by Ford and Fulkerson. Basically, the presented model is intended to be used rather as a mathematical model of decision processes than as a tool for flow optimization in networks. Moreover, it concerns rather flow of information than material media. Branches of the network are interpreted as decision rules with elementary conditions and decisions in the nodes, whereas the whole network represents a decision algorithm. It is shown that a flow in such networks is governed by Bayes\u2019 formula. In this case, however, the formula describes deterministic information flow distribution among branches of the network, without referring to its probabilistic character.

{"abstract": "We describe WEST, a WEb browser for Small Terminals, that aims to solve some of the problems associated with accessing web pages on hand-held devices. Through a novel combination of text reduction and focus+context visualization, users can access web pages from a very limited display environment, since the system will provide an overview of the contents of a web page even when it is too large to be displayed in its entirety. To make maximum use of the limited resources available on a typical hand-held terminal, much of the most demanding work is done by a proxy server, allowing the terminal to concentrate on the task of providing responsive user interaction. The system makes use of some interaction concepts reminiscent of those defined in the Wireless Application Protocol (WAP), making it possible to utilize the techniques described here for WAP-compliant devices and services that may become available in the near future.", "authors": ["Staffan Bj\u00f6rk", "Lars Erik Holmquist", "Johan Redstr\u00f6m", "Ivan Bretan", "Rolf Danielsson", "Jussi Karlgren", "Kristofer Franz\u00e9n"], "n_citation": 205, "references": ["4377946c-9cc5-430f-b5a4-1abbd788fc75", "505576b0-9783-4bec-9d5f-443a0f3ca723", "52906219-086a-4196-9608-4064dc29ff8c", "6f831f89-a4e9-43dc-a008-76bede9c037f", "7669bae4-428e-4ee2-9a45-9df3067eb9ad", "7a1e7cd5-eb9d-4726-a5df-cebe0fcb6161", "90ca3ecc-702a-45ab-af75-8c5851ce7bb9", "9b295743-dc86-4b08-ad74-4f8bf6c44500", "a710bd9d-190c-46f4-b83c-ee8fd3f80c2f", "adeac47f-3f0d-485b-aaf4-3b02a7493446", "b65b1177-f376-421b-9097-16d71017de91", "c2624783-c8fb-458e-9ba7-c83b5ac998f1", "c3e8c0e1-fb5a-427c-819b-e09e02520341", "d70bb6a5-0485-442f-944b-57d2f1a02297", "ed842e06-5cfa-45b8-be30-052e065d12df"], "title": "WEST: a Web browser for small terminals", "venue": "user interface software and technology", "year": 1999, "id": "82927196-a176-4672-9a3f-4d5d075a948d"}

{"abstract": "This paper addresses qualitative and quantitative diversity and specialization issues in the framework of self-organizing, distributed, artificial systems. Both diversity and specialization are obtained via distributed learning from initially homogeneous swarms. While measuring diversity essentially quantifies differences among the individuals, assessing the degree of specialization implies correlation between the swarm's heterogeneity with its overall performance. Starting from the stick-pulling experiment in collective robotics, a task that requires the collaboration of two robots, we abstract and generalize in simulation the task constraints to k robots collaborating sequentially or in parallel. We investigate quantitatively the influence of task constraints and types of reinforcement signals on performance, diversity, and specialization in these collaborative experiments. Results show that, though diversity is not explicitly rewarded in our learning algorithm, even in scenarios without explicit communication among agents the swarm becomes specialized after learning. The degrees of both diversity and specialization are affected strongly by environmental conditions and task constraints. While the specialization measure reveals characteristics related to performance and learning in a clearer way than diversity does, the latter measure appears to be less sensitive to different noise conditions and learning parameters.", "authors": ["Ling Li", "Alcherio Martinoli", "Yaser S.

{"abstract": "The rough set theory, based on the original definition of the indiscernibility relation, is not useful for analysing incomplete information tables where some values of attributes are unknown. In this paper we distinguish two different semantics for incomplete information: the \"missing value\" semantics and the \"absent value\" semantics. The already known approaches, e.g. based on the tolerance relations, deal with the missing value case. We introduce two generalisations of the rough sets theory to handle these situations. The first generalisation introduces the use of a non symmetric similarity relation in order to formalise the idea of absent value semantics. The second proposal is based on the use of valued tolerance relations. A logical analysis and the computational experiments show that for the valued tolerance approach it is possible to obtain more informative approximations and decision rules than using the approach based on the simple tolerance relation.", "authors": ["Jerzy Stefanowski", "Alexis Tsouki\u00e0s"], "n_citation": 458, "title": "Incomplete Information Tables and Rough Classification", "venue": "computational intelligence", "year": 2001, "id": "f0c9fb11-9206-492e-8eea-957adcf122fb"}

{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#The past two decades have seen increasing sophistication in software work. Now and in the future, the work of both practitioners and researchers would be helped by a more objective and finer granularity recognition of types of software evolution and software maintenance activities as actually done. To these ends, this paper proposes a clarifying redefinition of the types of software evolution and software maintenance. The paper bases the proposed classification not on people's intentions but upon objective evidence of maintainers' activities ascertainable from observation of activities and artifacts, and/or a before and after comparison of the software documentation. The classification includes taking into account in a semi-hierarchical manner evidence of the change or lack thereof in: (1) the software, (2) the documentation, (3) the properties of the software, and (4) the customer-experienced functionality. A comparison is made with other classifications and typologies.

{"abstract": "Bit commitment is a fundamental cryptographic primitive with numerous applications. Quantum information allows for bit commitment schemes in the information theoretic setting where no dishonest party can perfectly cheat. The previously best-known quantum protocol by Ambainis achieved a cheating probability of at most 3/4. On the other hand, Kitaev showed that no quantum protocol can have cheating probability less than 1\\sqrt{2} (his lower bound on coin flipping can be easily extended to bit commitment). Closing this gap has since been an important open question. In this paper, we provide the optimal bound for quantum bit commitment. First, we show a lower bound of approximately 0.739, improving Kitaev's lower bound. For this, we present some generic cheating strategies for Alice and Bob and conclude by proving a new relation between the trace distance and fidelity of two quantum states. Second, we present an optimal quantum bit commitment protocol which has cheating probability arbitrarily close to 0.739. More precisely, we show how to use any weak coin flipping protocol with cheating probability 1/2 + \\eps in order to achieve a quantum bit commitment protocol with cheating probability 0.739 + O(\\eps). We then use the optimal quantum weak coin flipping protocol described by Mochon. Last, in order to stress the fact that our protocol uses quantum effects beyond the weak coin flip, we show that any classical bit commitment protocol with access to perfect weak (or strong) coin flipping has cheating probability at least 3/4.", "authors": ["Andr\u00e9 Chailloux", "Iordanis Kerenidis"], "n_citation": 34, "references": ["5919ffb2-ba96-4974-b477-75e9b8e92523", "64576552-3ab8-4deb-a222-0741593691f5", "675670f9-fc0d-4267-917d-9f6bae99dc2f", "78050134-325d-418a-92c1-2740de1f5f7d", "7bb4f3e7-4b4e-455c-97f8-4e614bae4d46", "7bea8f83-9c23-4177-8b2f-2a5100307e79", "86e2e631-f8af-44d0-9307-c429dfb2dcdd", "93542512-d885-4df2-861b-d51a6a6c7643", "d46604bf-d590-42f1-b265-a2218984707d", "e468fcbf-8373-4649-9e07-fd28a0f2d917", "e49da008-155f-4cd6-b4c7-ad72befe229b"], "title": "Optimal Bounds for Quantum Bit Commitment", "venue": "foundations of computer science", "year": 2011, "id": "35a695c3-8123-4ed5-9162-561c6c7db1c2"}

{"abstract": "The most widely applied resource allocation strategy is to balance, or equalize, the total workload assigned to each resource. In mobile multi-agent systems, this principle directly leads to equitable partitioning policies in which (i) the workspace is divided into subregions of equal measure, (ii) each agent is assigned to a unique subregion, and (iii) each agent is responsible for service requests originating within its own subregion. In this paper, we design distributed and adaptive policies to allow a team of agents to achieve a convex and equitable partition of a convex workspace.

{"abstract": "The recently initiated and rapidly developing research field of 'human interactive proofs' (HIPs) and its implications for the document image analysis (DIA) research field are described. Over the last five years, efforts to defend Web services against abuse by programs ('bots') have led to a new family of security protocols able to distinguish between human and machine users. AltaVista pioneered this technology in 1997 [Bro01, LBBB01]. By the summer of 2000, Yahoo! and PayPal were using similar methods. In the Fall of 2000, Prof. Manuel Blum of Carnegie-Mellon University and his team, stimulated by Udi Manber of Yahoo!, were studying these and related problems [BAL00]. Soon thereafter a collaboration between the University of California at Berkeley and the Palo Alto Research Center (PARC) built a tool based on systematically generated image degradations [CBF01]. In January 2002, Prof. Blum and the present authors ran the first workshop (at PARC) on HIPs, defined broadly as a class of challenge/response protocols which allow a human to authenticate herself as a member of a given group - e.g. human (vs. machine), herself (vs. anyone else), an adult (vs. a child), etc. All commercial uses of HIPs known to us exploit the gap in ability between human and machine vision systems in reading images of machine printed text. Many technical issues that have been systematically studied by the DIA community are relevant to the HIP research program. This paper describes the evolution of HIP R&D, applications of HIPs now and on the horizon, highlights of the first HIP workshop, and proposals for a DIA research agenda to advance the state of the art of HIPs.", "authors": ["Henry S.

{"abstract": "We describe the close connection between the now celebrated iterative turbo decoding algorithm of Berrou et al. (1993) and an algorithm that has been well known in the artificial intelligence community for a decade, but which is relatively unknown to information theorists: Pearl's (1982) belief propagation algorithm. We see that if Pearl's algorithm is applied to the \"belief network\" of a parallel concatenation of two or more codes, the turbo decoding algorithm immediately results. Unfortunately, however, this belief diagram has loops, and Pearl only proved that his algorithm works when there are no loops, so an explanation of the experimental performance of turbo decoding is still lacking. However, we also show that Pearl's algorithm can be used to routinely derive previously known iterative, but suboptimal, decoding algorithms for a number of other error-control systems, including Gallager's (1962) low-density parity-check codes, serially concatenated codes, and product codes. Thus, belief propagation provides a very attractive general methodology for devising low-complexity iterative decoding algorithms for hybrid coded systems.", "authors": ["Robert J.

{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#Mutation testing (MT) has been found to be effective at revealing faults. However, its high cost of application, due to the high number of mutants created and the effort to determine the equivalent ones, has motivated the proposition of alternative approaches for its application. One of them, named \u2018selective mutation\u2019, aims to reduce the number of generated mutants through a reduction in the number of mutant operators. A previous relevant study resulted in the proposition of a sufficient mutant operators set for FORTRAN, indicating that it is possible to have a large cost reduction in MT application, whilst preserving a high MT score. This work investigates procedures for the determination of a sufficient mutant operators set for C programs with the perspective of contributing to the establishment of low-cost, effective mutation-based testing strategies.

{"abstract": "A new approach to the recognition of temporal behaviours and activities is presented. The fundamental idea, inspired by work in speech recognition, is to divide the inference problem into two levels. The lower level is performed using standard independent probabilistic temporal event detectors such as hidden Markov models (HMMs) to propose candidate detections of low level temporal features. The outputs of these detectors provide the input stream for a stochastic context-free grammar parsing mechanism. The grammar and parser provide longer range temporal constraints, disambiguate uncertain low level detections, and allow the inclusion of a priori knowledge about the structure of temporal events in a given domain. To achieve such a system we provide techniques for generating a discrete symbol stream from continuous low level detectors and for enforcing temporal exclusion constraints during parsing. We demonstrate the approach in several experiments using both visual and other sensing data.", "authors": ["Aaron F.

{"abstract": "An analysis of sequential decoding is presented that is based on the requirement that a set probability error P/sub e/ be achieved. The error criterion implies a bounded tree or trellis search region: the shape of this is calculated for the case of a binary symmetric channel with crossover probability P and random tree codes of rate R. Since the search region is finite at all combinations of p and R below capacity, there is no cutoff rate phenomenon for any P/sub e/>0. The decoder delay (search depth), the path storage size, and the number of algorithm steps for several tree search methods are calculated. These include searches without backtracking and backtracking searches that are depth- and metric-first. The search depth of the non-backtracking decoders satisfies the Gallager reliability exponent for block codes. In average paths searched, the backtracking decoders are much more efficient, but all types require the same peak storage allocation. Comparisons are made to well-known algorithms. >", "authors": ["John B.

{"abstract": "The use of energy-minimizing curves, known as \"snakes\" to extract features of interest in images has been introduced by Kass, Witkin and Terzopoulos (1987). A balloon model was introduced by Cohen (1991) as a way to generalize and solve some of the problems encountered with the original method. A 3-D generalization of the balloon model as a 3-D deformable surface, which evolves in 3-D images, is presented. It is deformed under the action of internal and external forces attracting the surface toward detected edgels by means of an attraction potential. We also show properties of energy-minimizing surfaces concerning their relationship with 3-D edge points. To solve the minimization problem for a surface, two simplified approaches are shown first, defining a 3-D surface as a series of 2-D planar curves. Then, after comparing finite-element method and finite-difference method in the 2-D problem, we solve the 3-D model using the finite-element method yielding greater stability and faster convergence. This model is applied for segmenting magnetic resonance images. >", "authors": ["Laurent D.

{"abstract": "Impulsive noise bursts in communication systems are traditionally handled by incorporating in the receiver a limiter which clips the received signal before integration. An empirical justification for this procedure is that it generally causes the signal-to-noise ratio to increase. Recently, very accurate models of impulsive noise were presented, based on the theory of symmetric /spl alpha/-stable probability density functions. We examine the performance of optimum receivers, designed to detect signals embedded in impulsive noise which is modeled as an infinite variance symmetric /spl alpha/-stable process, and compare it against the performance of several suboptimum receivers. As a measure of receiver performance, we compute an asymptotic expression for the probability of error for each receiver and compare it to the probability of error calculated by extensive Monte-Carlo simulation. >", "authors": ["George A.

{"abstract": "A new algorithm using invariant spectral features for segmenting colour images is presented in this paper. Input data are three primary images obtained from a colour sensor. The input colour image is transformed to IHS (Intensity, Hue, Saturation) colour space. This colour space transform compensates for illumination variations and delivers image pixel values with low variance for individual colour regions, hence contributing to simplified segmentation. The hue and saturation images are then separately filtered and combined. The resulting image is segmented by means of a threshold process. An opening operation on the segmented image completes the algorithm. Experimental results obtained for several images are presented.

Using data from three large-scale Internet services, we analyzed the causes of their failures and the (potential) effectiveness of various techniques for preventing and mitigating service failure. We find that (1) operator error is the largest cause of failures in two of the three services, (2) operator errors is the largest contributor to time to repair in two of the three services, (3) configuration errors are the largest category of operator errors, (4) failures in custom-written front-end software are significant, and (5) more extensive online testing and more thoroughly exposing and detecting component failures would reduce failure rates in at least one service.

{"abstract": "Many companies have adopted Process-aware Information Systems (PAIS) to support their business processes in some form. On the one hand these systems typically log events (e.g., in transaction logs or audit trails) related to the actual business process executions. On the other hand explicit process models describing how the business process should (or is expected to) be executed are frequently available. Together with the data recorded in the log, this situation raises the interesting question ''Do the model and the log conform to each other?''. Conformance checking, also referred to as conformance analysis, aims at the detection of inconsistencies between a process model and its corresponding execution log, and their quantification by the formation of metrics. This paper proposes an incremental approach to check the conformance of a process model and an event log. First of all, the fitness between the log and the model is measured (i.e., ''Does the observed process comply with the control flow specified by the process model?''). Second, the appropriateness of the model can be analyzed with respect to the log (i.e., ''Does the model describe the observed process in a suitable way?''). Appropriateness can be evaluated from both a structural and a behavioral perspective. To operationalize the ideas presented in this paper a Conformance Checker has been implemented within the ProM framework, and it has been evaluated using artificial and real-life event logs.", "authors": ["A Anne Rozinat", "van der Wmp Wil Aalst"], "n_citation": 739, "references": ["08e139c7-baf8-4ed3-a927-31c62d2a5a5c", "0dc28887-1f74-4496-b808-f6dab6e46ea4", "1fbf97b1-a887-4c28-bb2f-21e3570fac8e", "37cfbbff-bbfa-4b8e-96d1-0826ce1e23e7", "4a7f8af0-c721-4958-9043-0d9ba37ad064", "632752e8-b6fb-42f4-b08d-90c4d2f91702", "6341a051-88ad-4018-a595-03645dfdd5b8", "822fd357-5794-44a5-adc6-4b1453b41524", "834f41d9-408e-4d98-bdcf-5639d088bdc4", "a6353623-4145-440b-85c4-176c0aab4bea", "c2d7363c-bb57-4526-a914-066015b48638", "c6f4c4b0-750a-4203-9de9-d1b40e4f35de", "c9247b94-7aed-41c4-8f48-3a9aaba2158d", "c9a8d1ef-5aa2-4b81-bc35-d986024eaa4b", "cdb96117-5173-45f8-9437-fbef9cbe6f58", "d524027f-7999-49c8-a751-9a91635b7610", "eafe9070-ec42-4439-96db-5e2cf7d3a0f7", "f8d7100a-5bd7-4c93-8d92-7cf262d1d749"], "title": "Conformance checking of processes based on monitoring real behavior", "venue": "Information Systems", "year": 2008, "id": "ef8de76a-262e-4875-b2fd-b2253bc73df4"}

{"abstract": "This paper describes a general purpose method for solving convex optimization problems in a distributed computing environment. In particular, if the problem data includes a large linear operator or matrix \\(A\\), the method allows for handling each sub-block of \\(A\\) on a separate machine. The approach works as follows. First, we define a canonical problem form called graph form, in which we have two sets of variables related by a linear operator \\(A\\), such that the objective function is separable across these two sets of variables. Many types of problems are easily expressed in graph form, including cone programs and a wide variety of regularized loss minimization problems from statistics, like logistic regression, the support vector machine, and the lasso. Next, we describe graph projection splitting, a form of Douglas\u2013Rachford splitting or the alternating direction method of multipliers, to solve graph form problems serially. Finally, we derive a distributed block splitting algorithm based on graph projection splitting. In a statistical or machine learning context, this allows for training models exactly with a huge number of both training examples and features, such that each processor handles only a subset of both. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only general purpose method with this property. We present several numerical experiments in both the serial and distributed settings.", "authors": ["Neal Parikh", "Stephen P.

{"abstract": "Wind turbines are currently operated at their peak power extraction efficiency without consideration of the aerodynamic coupling between neighboring turbines. This mode of operation leads to inefficient, sub-optimal power capture at the wind farm level. By explicitly accounting for the aerodynamic wake interactions between neighboring wind turbines within a farm, we aim to characterize optimal control policies that maximize the power captured by a collection of wind turbines operating in quasi-steady wind flow conditions. In this paper, we consider two wake interaction models, termed near-field and far-field, describing wake propagation under densely and sparsely spaced turbine arrays, respectively. Under the near-field model, we derive a closed form expression for the optimal control policy maximizing power capture for a one-dimensional array of wind turbines. Moreover, we show that the optimal control policy is both static and independent of the free stream wind velocity, being thus amenable to a decentralized implementation. We also formulate and solve numerically the problem of jointly optimizing over the control policy and placement of turbines in a one dimensional 3-turbine array under the far-field model.", "authors": ["Eilyan Bitar", "Peter Seiler"], "n_citation": 43, "references": ["994fcee8-eb47-4e84-8654-61ede12a3291", "b18f7dbb-50f2-4ed6-b270-fee4a30eb3c6", "ce411178-8ecb-46bc-94f6-cd07c5ddc775"], "title": "Coordinated control of a wind turbine array for power maximization", "venue": "american control conference", "year": 2013, "id": "36120756-f270-4fb7-a89e-6766635bb0c2"}

{"abstract": "Humans demonstrate a remarkable ability to generate accurate and appropriate motor behavior under many different and often uncertain environmental conditions. We previously proposed a new modular architecture, the modular selection and identification for control (MOSAIC) model, for motor learning and control based on multiple pairs of forward (predictor) and inverse (controller) models. The architecture simultaneously learns the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the set of inverse models appropriate for a given environment. It combines both feedforward and feedback sensorimotor information so that the controllers can be selected both prior to movement and subsequently during movement. This article extends and evaluates the MOSAIC architecture in the following respects. The learning in the architecture was implemented by both the original gradient-descent method and the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. Unlike gradient descent, the newly derived EM algorithm is robust to the initial starting conditions and learning parameters. Second, simulations of an object manipulation task prove that the architecture can learn to manipulate multiple objects and switch between them appropriately. Moreover, after learning, the model shows generalization to novel objects whose dynamics lie within the polyhedra of already learned dynamics. Finally, when each of the dynamics is associated with a particular object shape, the model is able to select the appropriate controller before movement execution. When presented with a novel shape-dynamic pairing, inappropriate activation of modules is observed followed by on-line correction.", "authors": ["Masahiko Haruno", "Daniel M.

An effective framework through defining a class of coordinated saturation functions is introduced, under which both a first-order finite-time observer and a high-order finite-time observer are constructed. By applying the homogeneous theory for stability analysis, it is proven that all the states of the followers can converge to that of the leader in finite time under our proposed observers. With mild modifications of our control strategies, the foregoing results are then extended to the distributed finite-time containment control problem, where the states of the followers converge to the convex hull spanned by the multiple dynamic leaders.

The goal of Restructuring is to reorganize this initial conceptual model into a new conceptual model, which is built bearing in mind the use of the restructured ontology by the ontology/application that reuses it. Finally, the objective of Forward Engineering is output a new implementation of the ontology.

{"abstract": "This paper presents some highlights in the application of neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and rough sets to automated knowledge acquisition. These techniques are capable of dealing with inexact and imprecise problem domains and have been demonstrated to be useful in the solution of classification problems. It addresses the issue of the application of appropriate evaluation criteria such as rule base accuracy and comprehensibility for new knowledge acquisition techniques. An empirical study is then described in which three approaches to knowledge acquisition are investigated. The first approach combines neural networks and fuzzy logic, the second, genetic algorithms and fuzzy logic, and in the third a rough sets approach has been examined, and compared. In this study neural network and genetic algorithm fuzzy rule induction systems have been developed and applied to three classification problems. Rule induction software based on rough sets theory was also used to generate and test rule bases for the same data. A comparison of these approaches with the C4.5 inductive algorithm was also carried out. Our research to date indicates that, based on the evaluation criteria used, the genetic/fuzzy approach compares more than favourably with the neuro/fuzzy and rough set approaches. On the data sets used the genetic algorithm system displays a higher accuracy of classification and rule base comprehensibility than the C4.5 inductive algorithm.", "authors": ["Ilona Jagielska", "Chris Matthews", "Tim Whitfort"], "n_citation": 206, "references": ["3291e54c-773c-412a-93b0-666345f8499e", "564b611e-57f6-4101-a350-2961a03bab7d", "62549bc2-e0b3-46e8-8d32-390dded105d5", "7c0caac2-b375-45c9-92f6-0efff7a423e2", "a4589cfe-15e7-4c34-9349-d002d1d2c9df"], "title": "An investigation into the application of neural networks, fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and rough sets to automated knowledge acquisition for classification problems", "venue": "Neurocomputing", "year": 1999, "id": "715f3a35-d40e-488c-a1d9-a31765316aa5"}

{"abstract": "We present a learning technique that automatically syn- thesizes realistic locomotion for the animation of physics-based models of animals. The method is especially suitable for animals with highly flexible, many-degree-of-freedom bodies and a consid- erable number of internal muscle actuators, such as snakes and fish. The multilevel learning process first performs repeated loco- motion trials in search of actuator control functions that produce efficient locomotion, presuming virtually nothing about the form of these functions. Applying a short-time Fourier analysis, the learn- ing process then abstracts control functions that produce effective locomotion into a compact representation which makes explicit the natural quasi-periodicities and coordination of the muscle actions. The artificial animals can finally put into practice the compact, efficient controllers that they have learned. Their locomotion learn- ing abilities enable them to accomplish higher-level tasks specified by the animator while guided by sensory perception of their vir- tual world; e.g., locomotion to a visible target. We demonstrate physics-based animation of learned locomotion in dynamic models of land snakes, fishes, and even marine mammals that have trained themselves to perform \"SeaWorld\" stunts.", "authors": ["Radek Grzeszczuk", "Demetri Terzopoulos"], "n_citation": 231, "references": ["07a1e164-72da-4732-b8ff-2fc8b58e7be3", "1d84757b-86a9-4015-9c8e-1e255521e3c8", "26bdb93f-0b83-43e1-8d5b-0e8f56605c54", "2eb0f5b5-4ec0-48d9-8525-066dca10adef", "2ef2bb66-6f65-43f3-b748-f73f94800825", "498e5514-68b7-4332-9571-ef29957a6862", "b98cf95e-f117-442a-9df7-f514ad4594bb", "d8c6ea0a-d9aa-43ca-9394-1fe8761bab1f", "f73615b6-f09f-45df-8176-61f00078de2c"], "title": "Automated learning of muscle-actuated locomotion through control abstraction", "venue": "international conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques", "year": 1995, "id": "6c2c6205-e92c-42d7-93e7-4a95175bda7a"}

{"abstract": "Research studying the quality of software applications continues to grow rapidly with researchers building regression models that combine a large number of metrics. However, these models are hard to deploy in practice due to the cost associated with collecting all the needed metrics, the complexity of the models and the black box nature of the models. For example, techniques such as PCA merge a large number of metrics into composite metrics that are no longer easy to explain. In this paper, we use a statistical approach recently proposed by Cataldo  et al . to create explainable regression models. A case study on the Eclipse open source project shows that only 4 out of the 34 code and process metrics impacts the likelihood of finding a post-release defect. In addition, our approach is able to quantify the impact of these metrics on the likelihood of finding post-release defects. Finally, we demonstrate that our simple models achieve comparable performance over more complex PCA-based models while providing practitioners with intuitive explanations for its predictions.", "authors": ["Emad Shihab", "Zhen Ming Jiang", "Walid M.

{"abstract": "Part decomposition and conversely, the construction of composite objects from individual parts have long been recognized as ubiquitous and essential mechanisms involving abstraction. This applies, in particular, in areas such as CAD, manufacturing, software development and computer graphics. Although the part-of relationship is distinguished in object oriented modeling techniques, it ranks far behind the concept of generalization/specialization and a rigorous definition of its semantics is still missing. We first show in which ways a shift in emphasis on the part-of relationship leads to analysis and design models that are easier to understand and to maintain. We then investigate the properties of part-of relationships in order to define their semantics. This is achieved by means of a categorization of part-of relationships and by associating semantic constraints with individual categories. We further suggest a precise and, compared with existing techniques, less redundant specification of constraints accompanying part-of categories based on the degree of exclusiveness and dependence of parts on composite objects. Although the approach appears generally applicable, the object oriented Unified Modeling Language (UMF) is used to present our findings.

{"abstract": "A question is posed on how a particular subassembly sequence is generated in randomized assembly. An extended design of mechanical conformational switches [16] is proposed that can encode several subassembly sequences. A particular subassembly sequence is generated due to conformational changes of parts during one-dimensional randomized assembly. The optimal subassembly sequence that maximizes the yield of a desired assembly can be found via genetic search over a space of parameterized conformational switch designs, rather than a space of subassembly sequences. The resulting switch design encodes the optimal subassembly sequence so that the desired assemblies are put together only in the optimal sequence. The results of genetic search and rate equation analyses reveal that the optimal subassembly sequence depends on the initial concentration of parts and the defect probabilities during randomized assembly. The results indicate that abundant parts and parts with high defect probabilities should be assembled earlier rather than later.", "authors": ["Kazuhiro Saitou", "Mark J.

{"abstract": "We propose efficient implementations of Seymour and Thomas algorithm which, given a planar graph and an integer \u03b2, decides whether the graph has the branchwidth at least \u03b2. The computational results of our implementations show that the branchwidth of a planar graph can be computed in a practical time and memory space for some instances of size about one hundred thousand edges. Previous studies report that a straightforward implementation of the algorithm is memory consuming, which could be a bottleneck for solving instances with more than a few thousands edges. Our results suggest that with efficient implementations, the memory space required by the algorithm may not be a bottleneck in practice. Applying our implementations, an optimal branch decomposition of a planar graph of practical size can be computed in a reasonable time. Branch-decomposition based algorithms have been explored as an approach for solving many NP-hard problems on graphs. The results of this paper suggest that the approach could be practical.", "authors": ["Zhengbing Bian", "Qian-Ping Gu", "Marjan Marzban", "Hisao Tamaki", "Yumi Yoshitake"], "n_citation": 18, "references": ["6bd7fb0d-6d5d-4586-b085-78d6aad73a5a", "7fd28178-6604-4dae-8887-be260191dc6b", "877d79e2-dd2e-4b66-9a39-41c5b2465e1f", "a3894c1b-f7b4-4074-99db-e983dc0526b5", "b9d22933-f130-48ae-8e37-278289013c1c", "ba56e820-31bd-46fd-93c1-91391aaba599", "bb544a44-b669-4ec8-92da-1b06880065de", "c95d807e-9266-40e4-8ffd-740e9377cf47", "ca1d3032-e288-42f1-9228-f95da0535c0c", "ce261615-9b77-4e3a-91c2-312cae8c74d0", "d66391eb-6652-46b4-ba82-0001aafa52b2"], "title": "Empirical study on branchwidth and branch decomposition of planar graphs", "venue": "algorithm engineering and experimentation", "year": 2008, "id": "3612b8e5-f77b-4d7f-82c4-e8eae47d1d1a"}
{"abstract": "Today, Data Center Networks (DCNs) are re-architected in different new architectures in order to alleviate several emergent issues related to server virtualization and new traffic patterns, such as the limitation of bi-section bandwidth and workload migration. However, these new architectures will remain either proprietary or hidden in administrative domains, and interworking protocols will remain in-process of standardization for a time longer than the usually required time to market. Therefore, interworking cloud DCNs to provide the federated clouds is a very challenging issue that seems to be potentially alleviated by a software-defined networking (SDN) approach such as Openflow. In this paper, we propose a network infrastructure as a services (IaaS) software middleware solution based on Openflow in order to abstract the DCN architecture specifities and instantly interconnect DCNs. As a proof of concept we implement an experimental scenario dealing with virtual machine migration. Then, we evaluate the network setup and the migration delay. The use of the IaaS middleware allows automating these operations. OpenFlow solves the problem of interconnecting heterogeneous Data Centers and its implementation offers interesting delay values.", "authors": ["Bochra Boughzala", "Racha Ben Ali", "Mathieu Lemay", "Yves Lemieux", "Omar Cherkaoui"], "n_citation": 42, "references": ["07ffa0f6-c791-400e-8e01-c2d51cdd7ef3", "1661a60e-6145-4d4b-8bf8-32cfcea7d7ff", "5b8628f0-fb6d-46c3-925b-0e5e42471d28", "72db976e-5886-4750-a650-0ef209e3a51c", "8c60d874-b1fb-4a15-8e67-56fad71e69e7", "abf7f290-5b74-4b9a-9661-a1af46b0083a", "cefc87b2-c28f-4dcb-8a46-06a702569da0", "e63398e9-f70d-4872-9234-769ac28a51dc", "f08a3f7d-0eaa-427b-975e-1ab0c2dbc067"], "title": "OpenFlow supporting inter-domain virtual machine migration", "venue": "wireless and optical communications networks", "year": 2011, "id": "7dfa5c0c-d281-41fb-a3a5-6e830759a7a9"}
{"abstract": "Online photo services such as Flickr and Zooomr allow users to share their photos with family, friends, and the online community at large. An important facet of these services is that users manually annotate their photos using so called tags, which describe the contents of the photo or provide additional contextual and semantical information. In this paper we investigate how we can assist users in the tagging phase. The contribution of our research is twofold. We analyse a representative snapshot of Flickr and present the results by means of a tag characterisation focussing on how users tags photos and what information is contained in the tagging. Based on this analysis, we present and evaluate tag recommendation strategies to support the user in the photo annotation task by recommending a set of tags that can be added to the photo. The results of the empirical evaluation show that we can effectively recommend relevant tags for a variety of photos with different levels of exhaustiveness of original tagging.", "authors": ["B\u00f6rkur Sigurbj\u00f6rnsson", "Roelof van Zwol"], "n_citation": 1051, "references": ["0314113d-62b6-4b5a-954d-bd18f8beb2fa", "1553c170-1de4-4e06-8309-031138d1af14", "17fbbb03-8b91-4ea6-af29-9fc8fd1f4364", "1a4b7dd6-c11f-4fd1-9454-aeb6f3420d2a", "1ad63e8a-e0a8-422b-b3a4-8fdf23f50064", "36bdf4fe-a0d3-43b8-b5d3-ebd7d7979117", "750b0ac1-2ac9-4273-a9c8-baad11e26fcd", "8a7dd0d1-bdc4-4e4e-a499-792754b31762", "8bc5f80f-af26-47b4-aa0a-aab3a2e6c503", "98801e79-fc9d-4c6a-a383-10e937c9d008", "b13e4021-9b29-4cd4-862e-546af213eadd", "b1bf09fb-6dc2-4919-9eba-5e5866cd96a4", "c000f664-8505-4bdd-bab9-2a1ef52e52a7", "cde49578-941d-4037-8663-ec4a4c5a9019"], "title": "Flickr tag recommendation based on collective knowledge", "venue": "international world wide web conferences", "year": 2008, "id": "35063f66-8728-480a-ad01-f660b1258b22"}
{"abstract": "Many automated driver monitoring technologies have been proposed to enhance vehicle and road safety. Most existing solutions involve the use of specialized embedded hardware, primarily in high-end automobiles. This paper explores driver assistance methods that can be implemented on mobile devices such as a consumer smartphone, thus offering a level of safety enhancement that is more widely accessible. Specifically, the paper focuses on estimating driver gaze direction as an indicator of driver attention. Input video frames from a smartphone camera facing the driver are first processed through a coarse head pose direction. Next, the locations and scales of face parts, namely mouth, eyes, and nose, define a feature descriptor that is supplied to an SVM gaze classifier which outputs one of 8 common driver gaze directions. A key novel aspect is an in-situ approach for gathering training data that improves generalization performance across drivers, vehicles, smartphones, and capture geometry. Experimental results show that a high accuracy of gaze direction estimation is achieved for four scenarios with different drivers, vehicles, smartphones and camera locations.", "authors": ["Meng-Che Chuang", "Raja Bala", "Edgar A.

{"abstract": "This paper considers random testing of a compiler, using randomly generated programs as inputs, and comparing their behaviour with and without optimisation. Since the generated programs must compile, then we need to take into account syntax, scope rules, and type checking during our random generation. Doing so, while attaining a good distribution of test data, proves surprisingly subtle; the main contribution of this paper is a workable solution to this problem. We used it to generate typed functions on lists, which we compiled using the Glasgow Haskell compiler, a mature production quality Haskell compiler.

{"abstract": "For many languages that use non-Roman based indigenous scripts (e.g., Arabic, Greek and Indic languages) one can often find a large amount of user generated transliterated content on the Web in the Roman script. Such content creates a monolingual or multi-lingual space with more than one script which we refer to as the Mixed-Script space. IR in the mixed-script space is challenging because queries written in either the native or the Roman script need to be matched to the documents written in both the scripts. Moreover, transliterated content features extensive spelling variations. In this paper, we formally introduce the concept of Mixed-Script IR, and through analysis of the query logs of Bing search engine, estimate the prevalence and thereby establish the importance of this problem. We also give a principled solution to handle the mixed-script term matching and spelling variation where the terms across the scripts are modelled jointly in a deep-learning architecture and can be compared in a low-dimensional abstract space. We present an extensive empirical analysis of the proposed method along with the evaluation results in an ad-hoc retrieval setting of mixed-script IR where the proposed method achieves significantly better results (12% increase in MRR and 29% increase in MAP) compared to other state-of-the-art baselines.", "authors": ["Parth Gupta", "Kalika Bali", "Rafael E.

{"abstract": "Continuous queries are persistent queries that allow users to receive new results when they become available. While continuous query systems can transform a passive web into an active environment, they need to be able to support millions of queries due to the scale of the Internet. No existing systems have achieved this level of scalability. NiagaraCQ addresses this problem by grouping continuous queries based on the observation that many web queries share similar structures. Grouped queries can share the common computation, tend to fit in memory and can reduce the I/O cost significantly. Furthermore, grouping on selection predicates can eliminate a large number of unnecessary query invocations. Our grouping technique is distinguished from previous group optimization approaches in the following ways. First, we use an incremental group optimization strategy with dynamic re-grouping. New queries are added to existing query groups, without having to regroup already installed queries. Second, we use a query-split scheme that requires minimal changes to a general-purpose query engine. Third, NiagaraCQ groups both change-based and timer-based queries in a uniform way. To insure that NiagaraCQ is scalable, we have also employed other techniques including incremental evaluation of continuous queries, use of both pull and push models for detecting heterogeneous data source changes, and memory caching. This paper presents the design of NiagaraCQ system and gives some experimental results on the system's performance and scalability.", "authors": ["Jian-Jun Chen", "David J.

{"abstract": "In seeking to improve software, companies are finding out how much is involved in measuring it. They are also learning that the more integral software measurement is to the company's underlying business strategy, the more likely it is to succeed. We propose a framework or metamodel called the Model, Measure, Manage Paradigm (M/sup 3/P), which is our extension of the well known Quality Improvement Paradigm/Goal-Question-Metric paradigm (R.B. Grady, 1992; V.R. Basili and H.D. Rombach, 1988). M/sup 3/P helps counter a contributing factor commonly seen in failed measurement programs, namely the lack of well defined links between the numerical data and the surrounding development and business contexts, by coupling technical, business, and organizational issues into a given measurement program context. An example where links are important is in highly technical measurement and analysis reports which do not generally answer the concerns of senior executives. We present some early experience with our framework gathered from several case studies, discuss the 8 stages of M/sup 3/P implementation and describe a tool set we developed for use with M/sup 3/P.", "authors": ["Raymond J.

{"abstract": "In this paper, the task of recognizing signs made by hearing impaired people at sentence level has been addressed. A novel method of extracting spatial features to capture hand movements of a signer has been proposed. Frames of a given video of a sign are preprocessed to extract face and hand components of a signer. The local centroids of the extracted components along with the global centroid are exploited to extract spatial features. The concept of interval valued type symbolic data has been explored to capture variations in the same sign made by the different signers at different instances of time. A suitable symbolic similarity measure is studied to establish matching between test and reference signs and a simple nearest neighbour classifier is used to recognize an unknown sign as one among the known signs by specifying a desired level of threshold.

{"abstract": "Mobile agent technology has been proposed for various fault-sensitive application areas, including electronic commerce, systems management and active messaging. Due to the autonomy of mobile agents, there is no natural instance that monitors the progress of an agent's execution. As a result, agents may be lost or blocked due to node crashes or network partitioning even if there are other nodes available that could continue processing. In this paper, we describe a protocol that provides exactly-once semantics of agent execution and additionally reduces the blocking probability of agents by introducing observer nodes for monitoring the progress of agents. This protocol is based on conventional transactional technology such as defined by X/Open DTP or CORBA OTS.

{"abstract": "Many tree-based multicast algorithms have been proposed to provide an efficient software implementation on parallel platforms without hardware multicast support. These algorithms are either architecture-dependent (not portable) or architecture-independent (portable) but do not provide good performance when ported to different parallel platforms. Based on the LogP model, the proposed parameterized communication model can more accurately characterize the communication network of parallel platforms. The model encompasses a number of critical system parameters which can be easily measured on a given parallel platform. Based on the model, efficient methods to construct optimal multicast trees are proposed for both 1-port and /spl alpha/-port communication architectures. Experimental results conducted on the IBR/SP at Argonne National Laboratory are presented to compare the performance of the optimal multicast tree with two other known free-based multicast algorithms. We claim that our proposed multicast algorithms can be ported to different parallel platforms and provide a near-optimal performance as the truly machine-specific optimal performance is achievable only when the underlying detailed network characteristics are considered.", "authors": ["Ju-Young Lee Park", "Hyeong-Ah Choi", "Natawut Nupairoj", "Lionel M.

{"abstract": "When a software system enters the maintenance phase, the availability of accurate and consistent information about its organization can help alleviate the difficulties of program understanding. Reverse engineering methods aim at extracting such information directly from the code. While several tools support the recovery of the class diagram from object oriented code, so far no work has attacked the problem of statically characterizing the behavior of an object oriented system by means of diagrams which represent the class instances (objects) and their mutual relationships. In this paper a novel static analysis algorithm is proposed for extraction of the object diagram from the code, based on a program representation called the object flow graph. Partial object diagrams can be associated dynamically to the system by executing and tracing the program on a set of test cases. The complementary nature of these two views is discussed, and a novel approach to object oriented testing is derived from such a comparison.

{"abstract": "Over the last decades, improvements in CPU speed have outpaced improvements in main memory and disk access rates by orders of magnitude, enabling the use of data compression techniques to improve the performance of database systems. Previous work describes the benefits of compression for numerical attributes, where data is stored in compressed format on disk. Despite the abundance of string-valued attributes in relational schemas there is little work on compression for string attributes in a database context. Moreover, none of the previous work suitably addresses the role of the query optimizer: During query execution, data is either  eagerly  decompressed when it is read into main memory, or data  lazily  stays compressed in main memory and is decompressed on demand only  In this paper, we present an effective approach for database compression based on lightweight, attribute-level compression techniques. We propose a IIierarchical Dictionary Encoding strategy that intelligently selects the most effective compression method for string-valued attributes. We show that eager and lazy decompression strategies produce sub-optimal plans for queries involving compressed string attributes. We then formalize the problem of compression-aware query optimization and propose one provably optimal and two fast heuristic algorithms for selecting a query plan for relational schemas with compressed attributes; our algorithms can easily be integrated into existing cost-based query optimizers. Experiments using TPC-H data demonstrate the impact of our string compression methods and show the importance of compression-aware query optimization.

{"abstract": "The predicate elimination strategy is a complete resolution proof strategy for multi-predicate formulas. Essentially, the procedure focuses on one of the predicate symbols P, and attempts to deduce clauses independent of P by means of resolution in which only predicates in P are \u201cresolved away\u201d from parent clauses. The completeness theorem states that one can in this way, deduce an unsatisfiable P-independent set of clauses, provided the given set is unsatisfiable.   The strategy is then extended to a suitable form of semantic resolution. This leads to the following strategy: in the attempt to deduce an unsatisfiable P-independent set of clauses, apply elementary resolution to \u201cresolve away\u201d predicates in P only from parent clauses, one of which has all of its predicates in P positive (negative).", "authors": ["Raymond Reiter"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["112eeff7-c265-4808-aef5-55f592540e40", "509fe53e-2932-4dd3-b4cf-9e923afa48d0", "6f0da19b-2a76-4130-90f3-3c380562e235", "bc622419-a936-4109-8cfd-d7ef9f2f3e07", "c0a69970-4b14-492a-adcc-6928988a9f2a"], "title": "The predicate elimination strategy in theorem proving", "venue": "symposium on the theory of computing", "year": 1970, "id": "5e8356cc-a018-49fe-8fd1-d1c0bf419caa"}

The first is a trainable summarizer, which takes into account several features, including position, positive keyword, negative keyword, centrality, and the resemblance to the title, to generate summaries. Two new ideas are exploited: (1) sentence positions are ranked to emphasize the significances of different sentence positions, and (2) the score function is trained by the genetic algorithm (GA) to obtain a suitable combination of feature weights. The second uses latent semantic analysis (LSA) to derive the semantic matrix of a document or a corpus and uses semantic sentence representation to construct a semantic text relationship map. We evaluate LSA + T.R.M. both with single documents and at the corpus level to investigate the competence of LSA in text summarization. The two novel approaches were measured at several compression rates on a data corpus composed of 100 political articles.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a motion planning algorithm for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USVs) to navigate safely in dynamic, cluttered environments. The proposed algorithm not only addresses Hazard Avoidance (HA) for stationary and moving hazards but also applies the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (known as COLREGS). The COLREGS rules specify, for example, which vessel is responsible for giving way to the other and to which side of the \u201cstand-on\u201d vessel to maneuver. The three primary COLREGS rules were considered in this paper: crossing, overtaking, and head-on situations. For USVs to be safely deployed in environments with other traffic boats, it is imperative that the USV's navigation algorithm obey COLREGS. Note also that if other boats disregard their responsibility under COLREGS, the USV will still apply its HA algorithms to avoid a collision. The proposed approach is based on Velocity Obstacles, which generates a cone-shaped obstacle in the velocity space. Because Velocity Obstacles also specify which side of the obstacle the vehicle will pass during the avoidance maneuver, COLREGS are encoded in the velocity space very naturally.

{"abstract": "The routers in an Autonomous System (AS) must distribute the information they learn about how to reach external destinations. Unfortunately, today's internal Border Gateway Protocol (iBGP) architectures have serious problems: a \"full mesh\" iBGP configuration does not scale to large networks and \"route reflection\" can introduce problems such as protocol oscillations and persistent loops. Instead, we argue that a Routing Control Platform (RCP) should collect information about external destinations and internal topology and select the BGP routes for each router in an AS. RCP is a logically-centralized platform, separate from the IP forwarding plane, that performs route selection on behalf of routers and communicates selected routes to the routers using the unmodified iBGP protocol. RCP provides scalability without sacrificing correctness. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of an RCP prototype on commodity hardware. Using traces of BGP and internal routing data from a Tier-1 backbone, we demonstrate that RCP is fast and reliable enough to drive the BGP routing decisions for a large network. We show that RCP assigns routes correctly, even when the functionality is replicated and distributed, and that networks using RCP can expect comparable convergence delays to those using today's iBGP architectures.", "authors": ["Matthew Caesar", "Donald Caldwell", "Nick Feamster", "Jennifer Rexford", "Aman Shaikh", "Jacobus E. van der Merwe"], "n_citation": 521, "references": ["3384f928-6c3a-4147-bb4f-f0d3c39b5c0f", "4ce5b502-a7a9-4425-a9e9-e783ccb2c970", "5ad83b9b-6ae3-42ea-9b5f-e2fabe669c74", "79e5bcd7-3ea5-4df3-897d-0a666beacef8", "9a0b4859-70cc-41ee-b045-9f265a957a72", "9feaddaa-9617-4a09-82da-3a4f6df8557a", "b11fa79b-cf47-407e-8b64-cdce369f8145", "cdadb79e-6542-4947-8b3b-e4a0341e8389", "e8f55629-79c2-49eb-8216-4c4cfdcf62c5", "e924b398-7828-4d8e-88c1-0450585cb6b9", "fc950bc7-68b3-4260-a3fd-bf555d54911a", "fe75e64e-8f71-42f7-8fe0-25a205a79eca"], "title": "Design and implementation of a routing control platform", "venue": "networked systems design and implementation", "year": 2005, "id": "ff4fe9e5-a1c1-4354-87e7-734b87a20cd7"}

{"abstract": "This papers proposes new ways to enforce convergence to equilibria for Economic Model Predictive Control schemes. Economic Model Predictive Control is a control technique capable of optimizing an economic performance index while enforcing state and input constraints. For nonlinear systems and/or non-convex cost functionals, performance optimization may result in non converging behaviours. While this might be acceptable in some cases (i.e. operation of chemical reactors), it may be undesirable for other types of applications. In the present paper we discuss ways of enforcing convergence to equilibrium by trading it off with asymptotic performance. Indeed, while all trajectories converging to a given equilibrium yield the same asymptotic average cost, transient costs may differ and trade-offs are naturally highlighted between the latter and speed of convergence.", "authors": ["David Angeli", "Rishi Amrit", "James B.

{"abstract": "We develop a systematic approach to the discovery of parallel iterative schemes for solving the shape-from-shading problem on a grid. A standard procedure for finding such schemes is outlined, and subsequently used to derive several new ones. The shape-from-shading problem is known to be mathematically equivalent to a nonlinear first-order partial differential equation in surface elevation. To avoid the problems inherent in methods used to solve such equations, we follow previous work in reformulating the problem as one of finding a surface orientation field that minimizes the integral of the brightness error. The calculus of variations is then employed to derive the appropriate Euler equations on which iterative schemes can be based. The problem of minimizing the integral of the brightness error term is ill posed, since it has an infinite number of solutions in terms of surface orientation fields. A previous method used a regularization technique to overcome this difficulty. An extra term was added to the integral to obtain an approximation to a solution that was as smooth as possible. We point out here that surface orientation has to obey an integrability constraint if it is to correspond to an underlying smooth surface. Regularization methods do not guarantee that the surface orientation recovered satisfies this constraint. Consequently, we attempt to develop a method that enforces integrability, but fail to find a convergent iterative scheme based on the resulting Euler equations. We show, however, that such a scheme can be derived if, instead of strictly enforcing the constraint, a penalty term derived from the constraint is adopted. This new scheme, while it can be expressed simply and elegantly using the surface gradient, unfortunately cannot deal with constraints imposed by occluding boundaries. These constraints are crucial if ambiguities in the solution of the shape-from-shading problem are to be avoided. Different schemes result if one uses different parameters to describe surface orientation. We derive two new schemes, using unit surface normals, that facilitate the incorporation of the occluding boundary information. These schemes, while more complex, have several advantages over previous ones. ' 1986 Academic Press, Inc.", "authors": ["Berthold K. P. Horn", "Michael J.

{"abstract": "Design methods for sequence controllers play a very important role in advancing industrial automation. The increasing complexity and varying needs of modern discrete manufacturing systems have challenged the traditional design methods such as the use of ladder logic diagrams (LLDs) for programmable logic controllers. The methodologies based on research results in computer science have recently received growing attention by academic researchers and industrial engineers in order to design flexible, reusable, and maintainable control software. Particularly, Petri nets are emerging as a very important tool to provide an integrated solution for modeling, analysis, simulation, and control of industrial automated systems. This paper identifies certain criteria to compare LLDs and Petri nets in designing sequence controllers and responding to the changing control requirements. The comparison is performed through a practical system after introducing \"real-time Petri nets\" for discrete-event control purposes. The results reported in this paper will help: (a) further establish Petri net based techniques for discrete-event control of industrial automated systems; and (b) effectively convince industrial practitioners and researchers that it is worthy and timely to consider and promote the applications of Petri nets to their particular discrete-event control problems. >", "authors": ["Kurapati Venkatesh", "MengChu Zhou", "Reggie J.

{"abstract": "Given a pattern string of length n and an object string of length m, the string matching problem asks for the positions of all occurrences of the pattern in the object string. This paper investigates a generalization of string matching, in which the pattern is a sequence of pattern elements, each compatible with a set of symbols. The alphabet of symbols is infinite, with its members encoded in a finite alphabet. In contrast to standard string matching, which can be solved in simultaneous linear time and constant space, it is shown that generalized string matching requires a time-space product of $\\Omega ({{n^2 } / {\\log n}})$ on a powerful model of computation, when the alphabet is restricted to n symbols. Our proof uses a method of Borodin. The obvious algorithm for generalized string matching requires time $O(NM)$, where N is the length of the encoding of the pattern, and M is that of the object string. We describe an algorithm which solves generalized string matching in time $O(N + M + mN^{{1 / 2}} {\\o...", "authors": ["Karl R.

Our results clearly indicate that our scheme is scalable and that it reduces the message overhead by 40%, and the number of multicast groups used by 98% when compared to the fixed grid-based allocation scheme using 10 nodes, 1000 objects, and 20,000 grid cells.", "authors": ["Azzedine Boukerche", "Amber Roy"], "n_citation": 67, "references": ["5b16f934-afa9-4b07-a0a7-197345c4f89a", "646716a4-a226-4886-9755-b408f9d8bf04", "64eddc4b-b1c4-422a-8225-990ade4c90b3", "665d51c0-75d2-4a6c-82b3-b7e2697ae93f", "6dcd8a02-a293-4b1e-bdc5-27d666f438ea", "c7557384-951d-44b0-a99c-fd675f94efd5", "eab0b315-29c9-4d3b-a385-46fbd0cec2bb"], "title": "Dynamic Grid-Based Approach to Data Distribution Management", "venue": "Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing", "year": 2002, "id": "9504cec1-997e-4519-8ea1-902a6db70399"}

Traditional, or passive, self-assembly techniques have great difficulty in producing the asymmetric structures needed by the applications. This work discusses self-assembly methods that use active assembly agents (robots). It shows that swarms of such robots that communicate only by very simple messages can be programmed to form either wholly or partially specified structures, with the construction process possibly involving sacrificial components or scaffolds. The assembly agents have small memory and communication requirements, and interact only when they are in contact.

{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#In molecular dynamics simulations, the fastest components of the potential field impose severe restrictions on the stability and hence the speed of computational methods. One possibility for treating this problem is to replace the fastest components with algebraic length constraints. In this article the resulting systems of mixed differential and algebraic equations are studied. Commonly used discretization schemes for constrained Hamiltonian systems are discussed. The form of the nonlinear equations is examined in detail and used to give convergence results for the traditional nonlinear solution technique SHAKE iteration and for a modification based on successive overrelaxation (SOR). A simple adaptive algorithm for finding the optimal relaxation parameter is presented. Alternative direct methods using sparse matrix techniques are discussed. Numerical results are given for the new techniques, which have been implemented in the molecular modeling software package CHARMM and show as much as twofold improvement over SHAKE iteration. \u00a9 1995 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "authors": ["Eric Barth", "Krzysztof Kuczera", "Benedict Leimkuhler", "Robert D.

As a result, we present a steganographic scheme based on the search-order coding (SOC) compression method of vector quantization (VQ) indices in this paper. The major goal is to embed secret data into the compression codes of the host image such that the interceptors will not notice the existence of secret data. In the proposed scheme, the embedding process induces no extra coding distortion and adjusts the bit rate according to the size of secret data. According to the experimental results, it is confirmed that the proposed scheme yields a good and acceptable compression ratio of the image.

{"abstract": "We present the learning system MACCENT which addresses the novel task of stochastic MAximum ENTropy modeling with Clausal Constraints. Maximum Entropy method is a Bayesian method based on the principle that the target stochastic model should be as uniform as possible, subject to known constraints. MACCENT incorporates clausal constraints that are based on the evaluation of Prolog clauses in examples represented as Prolog programs. We build on an existing maximum-likelihood approach to maximum entropy modeling, which we upgrade along two dimensions: (1) MACCENT can handle larger search spaces, due to a partial ordering defined on the space of clausal constraints, and (2) uses a richer first-order logic format. In comparison with other inductive logic programming systems, MACCENT seems to be the first that explicitly constructs a conditional probability distribution p(C|I) based on an empirical distribution p(C|I) (where p(C|I) (p(C|I)) equals the induced (observed) probability of an instance I belonging to a class C).

{"abstract": "In multiple-antenna broadcast channels, unlike point-to-point multiple-antenna channels, the multiuser capacity depends heavily on whether the transmitter knows the channel coefficients to each user. For instance, in a Gaussian broadcast channel with M transmit antennas and n single-antenna users, the sum rate capacity scales like Mloglogn for large n if perfect channel state information (CSI) is available at the transmitter, yet only logarithmically with M if it is not. In systems with large n, obtaining full CSI from all users may not be feasible. Since lack of CSI does not lead to multiuser gains, it is therefore of interest to investigate transmission schemes that employ only partial CSI. We propose a scheme that constructs M random beams and that transmits information to the users with the highest signal-to-noise-plus-interference ratios (SINRs), which can be made available to the transmitter with very little feedback. For fixed M and n increasing, the throughput of our scheme scales as MloglognN, where N is the number of receive antennas of each user. This is precisely the same scaling obtained with perfect CSI using dirty paper coding. We furthermore show that a linear increase in throughput with M can be obtained provided that M does not not grow faster than logn. We also study the fairness of our scheduling in a heterogeneous network and show that, when M is large enough, the system becomes interference dominated and the probability of transmitting to any user converges to 1/n, irrespective of its path loss. In fact, using M=/spl alpha/logn transmit antennas emerges as a desirable operating point, both in terms of providing linear scaling of the throughput with M as well as in guaranteeing fairness.", "authors": ["Masoud Sharif", "Babak Hassibi"], "n_citation": 1368, "references": ["1b3c1b8a-0ef9-4b4b-ad3f-863cbf72b0c7", "1e24dcf9-a92d-4844-88b6-f9dab047523c", "36bd4347-f5c0-46c2-85a9-0edcebfefa5d", "748a2ab3-8b5f-4d0a-9e2d-af685089843a", "7d911d74-c4c1-4d4d-a737-5cf51e404c83", "95850b1f-08fb-4686-874a-f0f54d759bb3", "a588ea6b-c409-4ba3-8295-35463075134d", "bb92e52e-640c-4062-a5b6-317cbe4a55d9", "c097db79-b32a-4aec-b2d6-1cee012bcb22", "dba661ce-f5e2-4dcb-bb74-ecc6268cce1c", "dd3151e6-9756-4260-bc37-3507976fa578", "e61417f2-4d2c-4438-93b6-7e2fa5d98a46", "eac77a30-b4d0-4735-bf5c-cfc908aedda3"], "title": "On the capacity of MIMO broadcast channels with partial side information", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "year": 2005, "id": "e978280f-0a98-4085-a9b1-c51d9ee42388"}

Existing formalisms of such automata cope with the infiniteness of the alphabet by adding to the automaton a set of registers or pebbles, or by attributing the alphabet by labels from an auxiliary finite alphabet that is read by an intermediate transducer. These formalisms involve a complicated mechanism on top of the transition function of automata over finite alphabets and are therefore difficult to understand and to work with.#R##N##R##N#We introduce and study variable finite automata over infinite alphabets (VFA). VFA form a natural and simple extension of regular (and \u03c9-regular) automata, in which the alphabet consists of letters as well as variables that range over the infinite alphabet domain. Thus, VFAs have the same structure as regular automata, only that some of the transitions are labeled by variables. We compare VFA with existing formalisms, and study their closure properties and classical decision problems. We consider the settings of both finite and infinite words. In addition, we identify and study the deterministic fragment of VFA.

{"abstract": "In this paper, a new method for modeling and recognizing cursive words with hidden Markov models (HMM) is presented. In the proposed method, a sequence of thin fixed-width vertical frames are extracted from the image, capturing the local features of the handwriting. By quantizing the feature vectors of each frame, the input word image is represented as a Markov chain of discrete symbols. A handwritten word is regarded as a sequence of characters and optional ligatures. Hence, the ligatures are also explicitly modeled. With this view, an interconnection network of character and ligature HMMs is constructed to model words of indefinite length. This model can ideally describe any form of handwritten words, including discretely spaced words, pure cursive words and unconstrained words of mixed styles. Experiments have been conducted with a standard database to evaluate the performance of the overall scheme.

{"abstract": "The engineering of distributed adaptive software is a complex task which requires a rigorous approach. Software architectural (structural) concepts and principles are highly beneficial in specifying, designing, analysing, constructing and evolving distributed software. A rigorous architectural approach dictates formalisms and techniques that are compositional, components that are context independent and systems that can be constructed and evolved incrementally. This paper overviews some of the underlying reasons for adopting an architectural approach, including a brief \"rational history\" of our research work, and indicates how an architectural model can potentially facilitate the provision of self-managed adaptive software system.", "authors": ["Jeff Kramer", "Jeff Magee"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["04469f17-57b9-48dd-a425-65356088d02d", "0468472d-d16a-4521-b0e0-008e92fef477", "1001ddee-9865-4d95-b7c9-3994e3a3a823", "1412ff23-1344-4034-87ac-344cc850f0b3", "1e9ec4b8-829d-4b16-a22b-6dc4b7b9f582", "29f7e7d4-2771-4096-a72a-de82d7e16e73", "3f212451-ae39-447b-bfcf-b2a39a3710b1", "459479f3-eb55-407a-a8dd-e44202432d0e", "64153bc0-0c3a-4c5d-be93-b0f29bafc84f", "6aae31ec-b4ea-4e86-ba67-ae8d441e76fd", "7e5f03ef-c767-4012-a83d-f4c24a727333", "8441111e-b7fb-497f-a359-06afd07b92df", "85c1de96-97f5-478f-aa27-3c8581595c15", "91656129-9d9c-4e5a-942b-384e755c27de", "91b5fdfc-9d65-4e06-9408-a7256e4dda37", "9e7e66fa-bbb3-431f-8b73-03e5f26fb837", "b485133a-7ebb-4ce5-b2db-a8903fde39ab", "ba6e7aa2-8961-41a9-afb2-56e233a4c420", "d18d8bdb-a283-4794-ab86-9d243b4c1448", "d47c7ca7-d286-4967-a9ad-475da9e23908", "e1513deb-3a13-4c75-a6e3-f8d86199024e", "e3916584-9e4f-4d35-a311-c3810dbca602", "ea646192-2b16-4a56-971a-33e1ea97b8bd", "ff525e2e-f0de-43c2-b9f6-1e721cb26104"], "title": "A rigorous architectural approach to adaptive software engineering", "venue": "Journal of Computer Science and Technology", "year": 2009, "id": "e4f6715a-df62-46e9-825f-98a936a4ab80"}
{"abstract": "Configuration errors (i.e., misconfigurations) are among the dominant causes of system failures. Their importance has inspired many research efforts on detecting, diagnosing, and fixing misconfigurations; such research would benefit greatly from a real-world characteristic study on misconfigurations. Unfortunately, few such studies have been conducted in the past, primarily because historical misconfigurations usually have not been recorded rigorously in databases.   In this work, we undertake one of the first attempts to conduct a real-world misconfiguration characteristic study. We study a total of 546 real world misconfigurations, including 309 misconfigurations from a commercial storage system deployed at thousands of customers, and 237 from four widely used open source systems (CentOS, MySQL, Apache HTTP Server, and OpenLDAP). Some of our major findings include: (1) A majority of misconfigurations (70.0%~85.5%) are due to mistakes in setting configuration parameters; however, a significant number of misconfigurations are due to compatibility issues or component configurations (i.e., not parameter-related). (2) 38.1%~53.7% of parameter mistakes are caused by illegal parameters that clearly violate some format or rules, motivating the use of an automatic configuration checker to detect these misconfigurations. (3) A significant percentage (12.2%~29.7%) of parameter-based mistakes are due to inconsistencies between different parameter values. (4) 21.7%~57.3% of the misconfigurations involve configurations external to the examined system, some even on entirely different hosts. (5) A significant portion of misconfigurations can cause hard-to-diagnose failures, such as crashes, hangs, or severe performance degradation, indicating that systems should be better-equipped to handle misconfigurations.", "authors": ["Zuoning Yin", "Xiao Ma", "Jing Zheng", "Yuanyuan Zhou", "Lakshmi N.

{"abstract": "Context: Testing plays an important role in the quality assurance process for software product line engineering. There are many opportunities for economies of scope and scale in the testing activities, but techniques that can take advantage of these opportunities are still needed. Objective: The objective of this study is to identify testing strategies that have the potential to achieve these economies, and to provide a synthesis of available research on SPL testing strategies, to be applied towards reaching higher defect detection rates and reduced quality assurance effort. Method: We performed a literature review of two hundred seventy-six studies published from the year 1998 up to the 1st semester of 2013. We used several filters to focus the review on the most relevant studies and we give detailed analyses of the core set of studies. Results: The analysis of the reported strategies comprised two fundamental aspects for software product line testing: the selection of products for testing, and the actual test of products. Our findings indicate that the literature offers a large number of techniques to cope with such aspects. However, there is a lack of reports on realistic industrial experiences, which limits the inferences that can be drawn. Conclusion: This study showed a number of leveraged strategies that can support both the selection of products, and the actual testing of products.

{"abstract": "Continuous space language models have recently demonstrated outstanding results across a variety of tasks. In this paper, we examine the vector-space word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We find that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-specific vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, \u201cKing Man + Woman\u201d results in a vector very close to \u201cQueen.\u201d We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40% of the questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regularities by using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions.

A new upper bound on the number of states of the subset-automaton is established in the case of homogeneous automata. The complexity of the two basic steps of subset construction, i.e. the computation of deterministic transitions and the set equality tests, is examined depending on whether the nondeterministic automaton is an unrestricted one, an homogeneous one, a position one or a ZPC-structure, which is an implicit construction for a position automaton.

{"abstract": "Probabilistic software analysis aims at quantifying how likely a target event is to occur during program execution. Current approaches rely on symbolic execution to identify the conditions to reach the target event and try to quantify the fraction of the input domain satisfying these conditions. Precise quantification is usually limited to linear constraints, while only approximate solutions can be provided in general through statistical approaches. However, statistical approaches may fail to converge to an acceptable accuracy within a reasonable time.   We present a compositional statistical approach for the efficient quantification of solution spaces for arbitrarily complex constraints over bounded floating-point domains. The approach leverages interval constraint propagation to improve the accuracy of the estimation by focusing the sampling on the regions of the input domain containing the sought solutions. Preliminary experiments show significant improvement on previous approaches both in results accuracy and analysis time.", "authors": ["Mateus Borges", "Antonio Filieri", "Marcelo d'Amorim", "Corina S.

{"abstract": "Pollock, J.L., How to reason defeasibly, Artificial Intelligence 57 (1992) 1-42. This paper describes the construction of a general-purpose defeasible reasoner that is complete for first-order logic and provably adequate for the argument-based conception of defeasible reasoning that I have developed elsewhere. Because the set of warranted conclusions for a defeasible reasoner will not generally be recursively enumerable, a defeasible reasoner based upon a rich logic like the predicate calculus cannot function like a traditional theorem prover and simply enumerate the warranted conclusions. An alternative criterion of adequacy called i.d.e.-adequacy is formulated. This criterion takes seriously the idea that defeasible reasoning may involve indefinitely many cycles of retracting and reinstating conclusions. It is shown how to construct a reasoner that, subject to certain realistic assumptions, is provably i.d.e.-adequate.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a strategy for estimating the domain of attraction (DA) for non-polynomial systems via Lyapunov functions (LFs). The idea consists of converting the non-polynomial optimization arising for a chosen LF in a polynomial one, which can be solved via LMI optimizations. This is achieved by constructing an uncertain polynomial linearly affected by parameters constrained in a polytope which allows us to take into account the worst-case remainders in truncated Taylor expansions. Moreover, a condition is provided for ensuring asymptotical convergence to the largest estimate achievable with the chosen LF, and another condition is provided for establishing whether such an estimate has been found. The proposed strategy can readily be exploited with variable LFs in order to search for optimal estimates.

Our analysis reveals several interesting results. Despite growth, the degree distribution and the diameter of the inter-domain topology have remained relatively unchanged. Furthermore, there exists a four-level hierarchy of Internet domains classified by degree. However, connectivity between domains is significantly non-hierarchical. Despite increased connectivity at higher levels in the topology, the distribution of paths to prefixes from the backbone remained relatively unchanged.

{"abstract": "Architecture description languages (ADLs) are used to specify high-level, compositional views of a software application. ADL research focuses on software composed of prefabricated parts, so-called software components. ADLs usually come equipped with rigorous state-transition style semantics, facilitating verification and analysis of specifications. Consequently, ADLs are well suited to configuring distributed and event-based systems. However, additional expressive power is required for the description of enterprise software architectures --- in particular, those built upon newer middleware, such as implementations of Java's EJB specification, or Microsoft's COM+/.NET. The enterprise requires distributed software solutions that are scalable, business-oriented and mission-critical. We can make progress toward attaining these qualities at various stages of the software development process. In particular, progress at the architectural level can be leveraged through use of an ADL that incorporates trust and dependability analysis. Also, current industry approaches to enterprise development do not address several important architectural design issues. The TrustME ADL is designed to meet these requirements, through combining approaches to software architecture specification with rigorous design-by-contract ideas.

{"abstract": "Transactional Memory (TM) is considered as one of the most promising paradigms for developing concurrent applications. TM has been shown to scale well on >multiple cores when the data access pattern behaves \"well,\" i.e., when few conflicts are induced. In contrast, data patterns with frequent write sharing, with long transactions, or when many threads contend for a smaller number of cores, result in numerous conflicts. Until recently, TM implementations had little control of transactional threads, which remained under the supervision of the kernel's transaction-ignorant scheduler. Conflicts are thus traditionally resolved by consulting an STM-level  contention manager . Consequently, the contention managers of these \"conventional\" TM implementations suffer from a lack of precision and often fail to ensure reasonable performance in high-contention workloads.   Recently, scheduling-based TM contention-management has been proposed for increasing TM efficiency under high-contention [2, 5, 19]. However, only user-level schedulers have been considered. In this work, we propose, implement and evaluate several novel kernel-level scheduling support mechanisms for TM contention management. We also investigate different strategies for efficient communication between the kernel and the user-level TM library. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to investigate kernel-level support for TM contention management.   We have introduced kernel-level TM scheduling support into both the Linux and Solaris kernels. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that lightweight kernel-level scheduling support significantly reduces the number of aborts while improving transaction throughput on various workloads.", "authors": ["Walther Maldonado", "Patrick Marlier", "Pascal Felber", "Adi Suissa", "Danny Hendler", "Alexandra Fedorova", "Julia L.

{"abstract": "Shape retrieval/matching is a very important topic in com- puter vision. The recent progress in this domain has been mostly driven by designing smart features for providing better similarity measure be- tween pairs of shapes. In this paper, we provide a new perspective to this problem by considering the existing shapes as a group, and study their similarity measures to the query shape in a graph structure. Our method is general and can be built on top of any existing shape match- ing algorithms. It learns a better metric through graph transduction by propagating the model through existing shapes, in a way similar to com- puting geodesics in shape manifold. However, the proposed method does not require learning the shape manifold explicitly and it does not require knowing any class labels of existing shapes. The presented experimen- tal results demonstrate that the proposed approach yields significant improvements over the state-of-art shape matching algorithms.

It also draws on the most prolific problems in the past century of symbolic logic: the decision problem, completeness and incompleteness of logical theories, and finally complexity theory. The problem of modularly combining special purpose algorithms for each domain is as deep and intriguing as finding new algorithms that work particularly well in the context of a combination. SMT also enjoys a very useful role in software engineering. Modern software, hardware analysis and model-based tools are increasingly complex and multi-faceted software systems.

Using the size and the number of subimages for prototype generation and the size of the test images as the parameters in the learning and recognition phases, we establish the regions of reliable classification in the space of subimage parameters. The results of classification tests show the high performance of the proposed method that may have industrial application for texture classification.", "authors": ["Ra\u00fal Enrique S\u00e1nchez-Y\u00e1\u00f1ez", "Evguenii V.

{"abstract": "The Elite Care Information Technology Group has deployed a system with many elements of pervasive computing, including portable and wearable devices and wireless networking, to create intelligent and responsive work and living spaces for the elderly in a residential setting. Elite Care based the setting's layout on an apartment complex rather than a hospital with its hallways and rooms. By using a social care model that has the staff making house calls rather than doctors making rounds, the residents continue to live as normally as they can. In this scheme, pervasive sensors and staff assist residents in maintaining their independence, offering assistance as necessary and using the pervasive sensors to monitor vital signs and health indicators. Elite Care has harnessed the technology in direct and important ways to construct a more humane and human world for its residents and staff.", "authors": ["Vince Stanford"], "n_citation": 101, "title": "Using pervasive computing to deliver elder care", "venue": "IEEE Pervasive Computing", "year": 2002, "id": "623fb547-9c02-42a0-95c3-00db47946b46"}
{"abstract": "Transient stabilization of power systems in response to large disturbances is a challenging problem of high complexity. The complexity arises from the large number of system states and the nonlinearities in system dynamics which evolve at various time scales. The first contribution of this paper is a two-level approach to multi-time scale modeling of power system dynamics which includes dynamics of power-electronically controlled devices, such as Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) and High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) lines. This approach proposes an interaction variable-based power system model suitable for the design of the FACTS controllers. The second contribution is an ectropy-based cooperative controller for FACTS capable of transiently stabilizing generator dynamics and extending the critical clearing time of a fault.", "authors": ["Milos Cvetkovic", "Marija D.

{"abstract": "Performance aspects of a Lagrangian relaxation based heuristic for solving large 0-1 integer linear programs are discussed. In particular, we look at its application to airline and railway crew scheduling problems. We present a scalable parallelization of the original algorithm used in production at Carmen Systems AB, Goteborg, Sweden, based on distributing the variables. A lazy variant of this approach which decouples communication and computation is even useful on networks of workstations. Furthermore, we develop a new sequential active set strategy which requires less work and is better adapted to the memory hierarchy properties of modern RISC processors. This algorithm is also suited for parallelization on a moderate number of networked workstations.

{"abstract": "Troubleshooting the performance of production software is challenging. Most existing tools, such as profiling, tracing, and logging systems, reveal what events occurred during performance anomalies. However, users of such toolsmust infer why these events occurred; e.g., that their execution was due to a root cause such as a specific input request or configuration setting. Such inference often requires source code and detailed application knowledge that is beyond system administrators and end users.#R##N##R##N#This paper introduces performance summarization, a technique for automatically diagnosing the root causes of performance problems. Performance summarization instruments binaries as applications execute. It first attributes performance costs to each basic block. It then uses dynamic information flow tracking to estimate the likelihood that a block was executed due to each potential root cause. Finally, it summarizes the overall cost of each potential root cause by summing the per-block cost multiplied by the cause-specific likelihood over all basic blocks. Performance summarization can also be performed differentially to explain performance differences between two similar activities. X-ray is a tool that implements performance summarization.

{"abstract": "This paper presents hardware and software mechanisms to enable concurrent direct network access (CDNA) by operating systems running within a virtual machine monitor. In a conventional virtual machine monitor, each operating system running within a virtual machine must access the network through a software-virtualized network interface. These virtual network interfaces are multiplexed in software onto a physical network interface, incurring significant performance overheads. The CDNA architecture improves networking efficiency and performance by dividing the tasks of traffic multiplexing, interrupt delivery, and memory protection between hardware and software in a novel way. The virtual machine monitor delivers interrupts and provides protection between virtual machines, while the network interface performs multiplexing of the network data. In effect, the CDNA architecture provides the abstraction that each virtual machine is connected directly to its own network interface. Through the use of CDNA, many of the bottlenecks imposed by software multiplexing can be eliminated without sacrificing protection, producing substantial efficiency improvements", "authors": ["Paul Willmann", "Jeffrey Shafer", "David Carr", "Aravind Menon", "Scott Rixner", "Alan L.

{"abstract": "Software defect prediction model was built by Artificial Neural Network (ANN).ANN connection weights were optimized by Artificial Bee Colony (ABC).Parametric cost-sensitivity feature was added to ANN by using a new error function.Model was applied to five publicly available datasets from the NASA repository.Results were compared with other cost-sensitive and non-cost-sensitive studies. The software development life cycle generally includes analysis, design, implementation, test and release phases. The testing phase should be operated effectively in order to release bug-free software to end users. In the last two decades, academicians have taken an increasing interest in the software defect prediction problem, several machine learning techniques have been applied for more robust prediction. A different classification approach for this problem is proposed in this paper. A combination of traditional Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and the novel Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm are used in this study. Training the neural network is performed by ABC algorithm in order to find optimal weights. The False Positive Rate (FPR) and False Negative Rate (FNR) multiplied by parametric cost coefficients are the optimization task of the ABC algorithm. Software defect data in nature have a class imbalance because of the skewed distribution of defective and non-defective modules, so that conventional error functions of the neural network produce unbalanced FPR and FNR results. The proposed approach was applied to five publicly available datasets from the NASA Metrics Data Program repository. Accuracy, probability of detection, probability of false alarm, balance, Area Under Curve (AUC), and Normalized Expected Cost of Misclassification (NECM) are the main performance indicators of our classification approach. In order to prevent random results, the dataset was shuffled and the algorithm was executed 10 times with the use of n-fold cross-validation in each iteration. Our experimental results showed that a cost-sensitive neural network can be created successfully by using the ABC optimization algorithm for the purpose of software defect prediction.", "authors": ["\u00d6mer Faruk Arar", "K\u00fcr\u015fat Ayan"], "n_citation": 11, "references": ["012214ad-ce33-4edb-b92b-9c5107196cd6", "02e019cb-a94c-4632-8bed-81b73ae9231a", "02e0342a-33d3-4d3f-9f1d-b14081edbc39", "0483f49f-2737-491d-9353-8ceeb8e2d788", "09a3aee1-d75c-41eb-aece-3d34dbfe5a8f", "0b04788e-3b91-4628-91a0-0c0e6178377b", "0c0f3b7c-b1e0-4b45-a55f-d0d05f01da29", "16681632-81f5-42df-9808-3cf4e24a375e", "166ea916-951c-4f67-ad66-74fc0631f986", "171007d3-32d5-4177-b78a-84a4752aa130", "1e102dff-e642-43bc-a4cc-36b12907b98b", "21a861b9-c5bd-4071-8333-406d8cf20344", "25e25b5f-e930-4e08-a3d8-ad59230d4dad", "2f02c44e-db7a-4359-9526-a54292179d3b", "2f1205ff-4c5e-495d-84af-c4cd464e28c0", "38f68332-6bc9-4998-a344-759cfda2fba0", "3a057a1b-e80f-4a43-bf0b-a6599bf341a6", "3db20f80-687c-40dc-928f-6448fdf41cd9", "473e80eb-e576-45e4-a43b-dc11089443ef", "4e617e38-cf4a-4f8e-9339-0ce1d5d7d5fb", "4ec29d6b-fb27-4bb1-8926-e70de71cbebe", "52fce2c5-8ed5-407a-a2d4-6aecbf84ca50", "53a9cbfb-b28e-4f3f-92c2-f51246a203ce", "53ec1f2b-8a6e-4e92-a90a-0cc29d55fb7b", "57af1f08-da6a-466f-97a2-99e98a992768", "63988b7a-99e5-45e3-a5ff-ff4683c533fa", "6c3b836b-1fc7-4e16-85d7-16ee9aa34845", "6cf0a34c-f6d0-4a54-9a6a-7c14969ac66e", "6e6202cd-6dbe-4bba-b198-326f2168c517", "706dae66-5418-4f3e-954b-d81b3c8d06ff", "73443e03-6f1a-4ee9-90b7-4d7b9c92ae36", "74908efc-a823-4b1b-955b-f755fc4a9552", "75a60b19-6ae0-435e-a030-694c3b7dc9d8", "7c790617-fc17-43ce-920c-f626acea1330", "8026f56a-a93e-4933-8ead-c9aa9e3f0498", "8981b455-88ce-4f9b-a958-25581782b1b3", "8b6d6b59-edc1-4a98-a24b-099f9a26226e", "91415593-0881-432e-9fba-96da4fd189c1", "927f7128-c00e-4220-b102-258c6a496c80", "9350d76b-9925-4734-bc76-0203e92abd03", "a0198ee7-5693-4769-9fcb-6d430687c718", "a05b8bcf-789e-4538-8f43-86e6d7bb4285", "af647f42-0b8d-480b-a36e-c7f351a95473", "b47503b8-8e21-4b6b-8e2d-3da52f79fbbb", "bb24d529-ae23-4491-bf13-74ba7a116080", "c2fd78d3-f379-421b-a912-c8cf13403933", "cf89c279-5722-4476-8c96-44807295505a", "d6d364c9-1355-472b-93a1-37d5074c4b2c", "da236a5b-d7a4-423c-a344-a5afe9b444a0", "f53162f2-504f-4527-b681-17dbe1a1c5a5", "f96bc0e7-baf3-4da0-a4b3-427ca3847679", "fcb41378-32f7-4aab-8458-fc5a99d74f92"], "title": "Software defect prediction using cost-sensitive neural network", "venue": "soft computing", "year": 2015, "id": "f6d414e2-c137-43dc-843e-aea0c9d4eb11"}
{"abstract": "Open bug reporting allows end-users to express a vast array of unwanted software behaviors. However, users\u2019 expectations often clash with developers\u2019 implementation intents. We created a classification of seven common expectation violations cited by end-users in bug report descriptions and applied it to 1,000 bug reports from the Mozilla project. Our results show that users largely described bugs as violations of their own personal expectations, of specifications, or of the user community\u2019s expectations. We found a correlation between a reporter\u2019s expression of which expectation was being violated and whether or not the bug would eventually be fixed. Specifically, when bugs were expressed as violations of community expectations rather than personal expectations, they had a better chance of being fixed.", "authors": ["Parmit K.

{"abstract": "Model Transformations can be used to bridge the gap between design and analysis  technical spaces  by creating tools that allow a model produced by a designer to be transformed to a model suitable for conducting automated analysis. Such model transformations aim at allowing the designer to benefit from the capabilities provided by analysis tools and languages. If the designer who is not a formal method expert is to benefit from such tools, the outcome of the analysis should also be transformed to the language used in the design domain.   This paper presents a study involving UML2Alloy, a tool for transforming UML models in form of UML class diagrams which are augmented with OCL constraints, to Alloy. The conversion allows analysis of UML models via Alloy, to identify consistencies in those UML models. We present a method of automatically creating a model transformation based on the original UML2Alloy transformation. The new transformation converts Alloy instances into the UML equivalent object diagram. The current technique is presented with the help of an example, along with a prototype implementation using the QVT standard.", "authors": ["S.

{"abstract": "Existing network simulators perform reasonably well in evaluating the performance of network protocols, but lack the capability of verifying and validating the correctness of network protocols. In this paper we have extended J-Sim - an open-source, component-based compositional network simulation environment - with the model checking capability to explore the state space created by a network protocol until either the entire state space is explored (if the state space is finite) or an error (e.g., a violation of a user-defined safety assertion) is discovered. We also exploit protocol-specific properties in the process of exploring the state space, to reduce the size of the state space and to guide the (best-first) search towards paths that can potentially locate errors in less time. As a proof of concept, we have demonstrated use of the J-Sim model checker in locating errors in an automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol. As compared to the Maude LTL model checker, the J-Sim model checker can locate errors in a timely manner and with shorter error traces.", "authors": ["Ahmed Sobeih", "Mahesh Viswanathan", "Jennifer C.

{"abstract": "Self-adaptive systems are a class of software applications, which are able to dynamically transform their internal structure and hence their behavior in response to internal or external stimuli. The transformation may provide the basis for new functionalities or improve or maintain non-functional properties in order to match the application better to its operational requirements and standards. Software Product Line Engineering has rich methods and techniques in variability modeling and management which is one of the main issues in developing self-adaptive systems. Dynamic software product lines (DSPL) have been proposed to exploit the knowledge acquired in SPLE to develop self-adaptive software systems.   In this tutorial, we portray the problem of developing self-adaptive systems. Then we investigate how the idea of dynamic software product line could help to deal with the challenges that we face in developing efficient self-adaptive software. We also offer insight into the different approaches that use dynamic software product line engineering for developing self-adaptive systems focusing on practical approaches by showing how the approaches are applied to real case studies and also methods for evaluating these approaches. This tutorial also discuss how DSPL could be used some relevant areas to self-adaptive systems and challenges which still exist in the area.", "authors": ["Mahdi Bashari", "Ebrahim Bagheri"], "n_citation": 50, "title": "Engineering self-adaptive systems and dynamic software product line", "venue": "software product lines", "year": 2013, "id": "7be6ebef-5ec4-4869-bbaa-0c350586853b"}
{"abstract": "It is widely acknowledged that adopting a socio-technical approach to system development leads to systems that are more acceptable to end users and deliver better value to stakeholders. Despite this, such approaches are not widely practised. We analyse the reasons for this, highlighting some of the problems with the better known socio-technical design methods. Based on this analysis we propose a new pragmatic framework for socio-technical systems engineering (STSE) which builds on the (largely independent) research of groups investigating work design, information systems, computer-supported cooperative work, and cognitive systems engineering. STSE bridges the traditional gap between organisational change and system development using two main types of activity: sensitisation and awareness; and constructive engagement. From the framework, we identify an initial set of interdisciplinary research problems that address how to apply socio-technical approaches in a cost-effective way, and how to facilitate the integration of STSE with existing systems and software engineering approaches.", "authors": ["Gordon D.

{"abstract": "As mobile robots become increasingly autonomous over extended periods of time, opportunities arise for their use on repetitive tasks. We define and implement behaviors for a class of such tasks that we call continuous area sweeping tasks. A continuous area sweeping task is one in which a group of robots must repeatedly visit all points in a fixed area, possibly with nonuniform frequency, as specified by a task-dependent cost function. Examples of problems that need continuous area sweeping are trash removal in a large building and routine surveillance. In our previous work we have introduced a single-robot approach to this problem. In this paper, we extend that approach to multi-robot scenarios. The focus of this paper is adaptive and decentralized task assignment in continuous area sweeping problems, with the aim of ensuring stability in environments with dynamic factors, such as robot malfunctions or the addition of new robots to the team. Our proposed negotiation-based approach is fully implemented and tested both in simulation and on physical robots", "authors": ["Mazda Ahmadi", "Peter Stone"], "n_citation": 132, "references": ["0037e773-48e2-436e-be0d-88f96c6e098f", "2553d44c-c384-4ef2-a797-bb77a58a3c54", "5253a588-c7f7-4f00-a3e4-510a2e223b60", "72c3f4d6-37ca-433a-a0e9-b4396adfd791", "7f741262-792b-4a1c-a064-58e13ca8d384", "946093ba-6742-4e08-afa2-a13653d3b1b4", "96803dcf-bd31-4b6a-b599-89255281bbfc", "f735be60-b10c-49fd-a3a0-ee5c45476f23"], "title": "A multi-robot system for continuous area sweeping tasks", "venue": "international conference on robotics and automation", "year": 2006, "id": "973c22db-8b37-4bb9-afe5-6812f0064669"}

{"abstract": "With the growing deployment of host and network intrusion detection systems, managing reports from these systems becomes critically important. We present a probabilistic approach to alert correlation, extending ideas from multisensor data fusion. Features used for alert correlation are based on alert content that anticipates evolving IETF standards. The probabilistic approach provides a unified mathematical framework for correlating alerts that match closely but not perfectly, where the minimum degree of match required to fuse alerts is controlled by a single configurable parameter. Only features in common are considered in the fusion algorithm. For each feature we define an appropriate similarity function. The overall similarity is weighted by a specifiable expectation of similarity. In addition, a minimum similarity may be specified for some or all features. Features in this set must match at least as well as the minimum similarity specification in order to combine alerts, regardless of the goodness of match on the feature set as a whole.

This makes the Web work as a shared repository not only for publishing intellectual resources, but also for their collaborative reediting. We will propose a general framework for clipping arbitrary Web contents as live objects, for defining IO ports on such a clip, and for the recombination and linkage of such clips based on both the original and some user-defined relationships among them. In our previous works, we proposed two separate frameworks for these three purposes; one works for the first two, and the other for the last.

{"abstract": "Mobile ad-hoc networking (MANET) is a collection of mobile nodes that want to communicate to each others, but has no fixed links like wireless infrastructure networks. Each node acts as a router and is responsible for dynamically discovering other nodes it can directly communicate with. Due to the network topology of an ad hoc network changes frequently and unpredictable, so the security of multicast routing becomes more challenging than the traditional networks. In this paper, we describe how any user in the multicast group can compose the group keys and use the group Diffie Hellman key-exchange protocol (GDH) to securely multicast data from the multicast source to the rest of the multicast group in wireless ad hoc networks. Then, according to the measures of GPS units, it allows the multicast source to structure representation of network topology, and computes a multicast tree. Therefore the multicast source can utilize the group set information with Prufer number of the multicast tree for multicast header. As a result, we deliver the group key based on the network topology and the multicast routing. It not only provides the multicast routing information, but also fits the robustness of the wireless networks and reduces the overhead for the security management.", "authors": ["Tzu-Chiang Chiang", "Yueh-Min Huang"], "n_citation": 73, "references": ["2d4ebb26-b4db-4f7c-9af4-18b3d7e0fba7", "5c35af19-f919-4073-a1d8-ec70cc4ca3c0", "6c184add-661f-4d7f-8472-3c788620c474", "7696cbf8-8b61-489b-ba3d-5e2a663abeba", "a5182c38-aa5f-48dc-b1ad-390fc624829d", "a7bc1916-3fa9-46cc-83b2-abe2d514b987"], "title": "Group keys and the multicast security in ad hoc networks", "venue": "international conference on parallel processing", "year": 2003, "id": "3b7e2a9d-23d3-4483-b243-a0771a0b9feb"}
{"abstract": "This paper addresses the question of how information-theoretically-derived compact representations can be applied in practice to improve storage and processing efficiency in DBMS. Compact data representation has the potential for savings in storage, access and processing costs throughout the systems architecture and may alter the balance of usage between disk and solid state storage. To realise the potential performance benefits, however, novel systems engineering must be adopted to ensure that compression/decompression overheads are limited. This paper describes a basic approach to storage and processing of relations in a highly compressed form. A vertical columnwise representation is adopted in which columns can dynamically vary incrementally in both length and width. To achieve good performance query processing is carried out directly on the compressed relational representation (using a compressed representation of the query), thus avoiding decompression overheads.

{"abstract": "A new intrinsic geometry based on a spectral analysis is used to motivate methods for aligning protein folds. The geometry is induced by the fact that a distance matrix can be scaled so that its eigenvalues are positive. We provide a mathematically rigorous development of the intrinsic geometry underlying our spectral approach and use it to motivate two alignment algorithms. The first uses eigenvalues alone and dynamic programming to quickly compute a fold alignment. Family identification results are reported for the Skolnick40 and Proteus300 data sets.

{"abstract": "Communicating with sensors has long been limited either to wired connections or to proprietary wireless communication protocols. Using a ubiquitous and inexpensive wireless communication technology to create Sensor Area Networks (SANs) will accelerate the extensive deployment of sensor technology. Bluetooth, an emerging, worldwide standard for inexpensive, local wireless communication is a viable choice for SANs because of its inherent support for some of the important requirements-low power, small form factor, low cost and sufficient communication range. In this paper we outline an approach, centered on the Bluetooth technology, to support a sensor network composed of fixed wireless sensors for health monitoring of highways, bridges and other civil infrastructures. We present a topology formation scheme that not only takes into account the traffic generated by different sensors but also the associated link strengths, buffer capacities and energy availability. The algorithm makes no particular assumptions as to the placement of nodes, and not all nodes need to be in radio proximity of each other. The output is a tree shaped scatternet rooted at the sensor hub (data logger) that is balanced in terms of traffic carried on each of the links. We also analyze the scheduling, routing and healing aspects of the resulting sensor-net topology.", "authors": ["Vipin Mehta", "Magda El Zarki"], "n_citation": 44, "references": ["23dd7fc0-1ebd-43ce-ab3e-43896512c209", "3bbf4625-79b3-4af7-9d6f-0f4c252f4b77", "6096aefc-eaaa-407e-a7dc-82b7b3a32a72", "6b527e7d-50c4-42f5-b3d2-b688d23b8138", "73574f5f-bf4f-44fb-b13f-d5eaa8c96619", "8fe74a2f-2bc1-4123-ae3b-957ab5f0bf8a", "9b531247-bb38-4d26-94e8-dab8c453e3ca", "afc06b7c-7fb3-4f88-942b-3076ed77920e", "b7c9f36d-9c92-4a6d-a3d8-3d81d5c839de", "c2ed65c1-e160-40a5-b336-fb999f1da714", "dfc9f1b0-a952-42e2-bc5e-c5d78c053d2d", "f8ece2c5-c8b1-4a1e-8528-c09357ec23a4"], "title": "A bluetooth based sensor network for civil infrastructure health monitoring", "venue": "Wireless Networks", "year": 2004, "id": "f315543f-4a7a-4104-987b-77b8f7d43eeb"}

We also develop new pruning theorems and probabilistic methods of picking goal orderings for the protocol screener, Athena, which greatly improve the efficiency and worst-case performance of Athena. In our first experiment, APG found new protocols for two-party mutual authentication with a TTP using symmetric keys. In our second experiment, APG also found new protocols for three different sets of security properties for two-party authentication and key agreement.

{"abstract": "This paper considers the problem of assigning the tasks of a distributed application to the processors of a distributed system such that the sum of execution and communication costs is minimized. Previous work has shown this problem to be tractable for a system of two processors or a linear array of N processors, and for distributed programs of serial parallel structures. Here we focus on the assignment problem on a homogeneous network, which is composed of N functionally-identical processors, each with its own memory. Some processors in the network may have unique resources, such as data files or certain peripheral devices. Certain tasks may have to use these unique resources; they are called attached tasks. The tasks of a distributed program should therefore be assigned so as to make use of specific resources located at certain processors in the network while minimizing the amount of interprocessor communication. The assignment problem in such a homogeneous network is known to be NP-hard even for N=3, thus making it intractable for a network with a medium to large number of processors. We therefore focus on task assignment in general array networks, such as linear arrays, meshes, hypercubes, and trees. We first develop a modeling technique that transforms the assignment problem in an array or tree into a minimum-cut maximum-flow problem. The assignment problem is then solved for a general array or tree network in polynomial time.", "authors": ["Cheol-Hoon Lee", "Kang G.

We use a highly interactive bottom-up inductive logic programming (ILP) algorithm to learn 'missing' grammar rules from an incomplete grammar. Using linguistic constraints on, for example, head features and gap threading, reduces the search space to such an extent that, in the small-scale experiments reported here, we can generate and store all candidate grammar rules together with information about their coverage and linguistic properties. This allows an appealingly simple and controlled method for generating linguistically plausible grammar rules. Starting from a base of highly specific rules, we apply least general generalisation and inverse resolution to generate more general rules. Induced rules are ordered, for example by coverage, for easy inspection by the user and at any point, the user can commit to a hypothesised rule and add it to the grammar.

Currently at Siemens Corporate Research (SCR), we are developing a real-time system for industrial maintenance assistance. The user is moving within a large industrial site. In order to provide the user with additional information the system needs to locate the user in both real and virtual world. In this scenario, the user is equipped with a mobile computer. The objective is to track and locate the user using a camera attached to the mobile computer. With a set of coded visual markers pre-registered with the global coordinate system, the optical localization could be solved by marker detection, tracking and pose estimation. In this paper, we present the real-time marker detection and pose estimation algorithms used in our mobile localization application. To work in large and complicated industrial environments, our system needs to recover localization information from limited correspondences. We consider two different pose estimation algorithms: the homography based algorithm and the 3-point algorithm.

In the study, not all the elements of the transition rate matrices (TRMs) in continuous-time domain, or transition probability matrices (TPMs) in discrete-time domain are assumed to be known. By fully considering the properties of the TRMs and TPMs, and the convexity of the uncertain domains, necessary and sufficient criteria of stability and stabilization are obtained in both continuous and discrete time.

Recent work in slicing concurrent programs examines how synchronization, communication, and non-determinism (along with traditional control and data dependence) affect values at certain program points. We are extending this work to slice the Promela programming language, used to specify protocols for the Spin model checker. An application of slicing may be its usefulness in paring down protocol descriptions to just the pieces that affect particular points of interest. Model checking and simulation of the pared-down protocol may, in some cases, be much more efficient.

{"abstract": "To achieve security in wireless sensor networks, it is important to be able to encrypt and authenticate messages sent between sensor nodes. Before doing so, keys for performing encryption and authentication must be agreed upon by the communicating parties. Due to resource constraints, however, achieving key agreement in wireless sensor networks is nontrivial. Many key agreement schemes used in general networks, such as Diffie-Hellman and other public-key based schemes, are not suitable for wireless sensor networks due to the limited computational abilities of the sensor nodes. Predistribution of secret keys for all pairs of nodes is not viable due to the large amount of memory this requires when the network size is large.In this paper, we provide a framework in which to study the security of key predistribution schemes, propose a new key predistribution scheme which substantially improves the resilience of the network compared to previous schemes, and give an in-depth analysis of our scheme in terms of network resilience and associated overhead. Our scheme exhibits a nice threshold property: when the number of compromised nodes is less than the threshold, the probability that communications between any additional nodes are compromised is close to zero. This desirable property lowers the initial payoff of smaller-scale network breaches to an adversary, and makes it necessary for the adversary to attack a large fraction of the network before it can achieve any significant gain.", "authors": ["Wenliang Du", "Jing Deng", "Yunghsiang S.

{"abstract": "Factor analysis, principal component analysis, mixtures of gaussian clusters, vector quantization, Kalman filter models, and hidden Markov models can all be unified as variations of unsupervised learning under a single basic generative model. This is achieved by collecting together disparate observations and derivations made by many previous authors and introducing a new way of linking discrete and continuous state models using a simple nonlinearity. Through the use of other nonlinearities, we show how independent component analysis is also a variation of the same basic generative model.We show that factor analysis and mixtures of gaussians can be implemented in autoencoder neural networks and learned using squared error plus the same regularization term. We introduce a new model for static data, known as sensible principal component analysis, as well as a novel concept of spatially adaptive observation noise. We also review some of the literature involving global and local mixtures of the basic models and provide pseudocode for inference and learning for all the basic models.", "authors": ["Sam T.

Despite this fact, little is known and even less has been published about user activities in operating OSNs. In this article we present a large-scale measurement analysis of user behavior in some popular OSNs: Bebo, MySpace, Netlog, and Tagged. A measurement framework has been created in order to observe user activity: more than 500 PlanetLab nodes across the globe have been used for our measurement, monitoring more than 80,000 users for six weeks by downloading more than 100 million profile pages. Based on the measurements, we address two key issues of online social networks: characterization of user activities and usage patterns in the examined OSNs. The main findings of the article include that users' online time spending can be modeled with Weibull distributions; soon after subscribing, a fraction of users tend to lose interest surprisingly fast; and the duration of OSN users' online sessions shows power law distribution characteristics.", "authors": ["L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Gyarmati", "Tuan Anh Trinh"], "n_citation": 94, "references": ["1a3fcb01-95e2-4994-bd88-b41f9408b4a2", "40d9a6c9-b99e-43cc-90eb-5259cf4416a0", "48d1fd6b-a2c0-4427-a353-85adef51fa62", "4c859183-ef97-49be-ba88-e096def9acf2", "58ffb14c-c145-44a0-9d5d-adf58643804f", "6174fffa-55f5-4bd6-b887-dd6980064305", "920345b6-30a2-45eb-82de-c6889f0fb497", "b3d4f419-af4d-4378-9b98-ee0e5e66cb6c", "cde64367-18fe-4ab9-9f4d-7d4d14bf996f", "e19f186e-3215-4707-bfbf-557cd3e4e479"], "title": "Measuring user behavior in online social networks", "venue": "IEEE Network", "year": 2010, "id": "644dd638-d004-4103-ba65-605f4ba4231b"}

{"abstract": "One of the main reasons that current commercial DBMSs provide only minimal support for temporal concepts is the size and complexity involved. Object-oriented databases, on the other hand, were developed to deal with complex database applications. Because temporal concepts require complex type support and advanced modeling concepts, object-oriented databases are excellent candidates for realization of temporal databases without requiring fundamental extensions to the basic data model. The ODMG (Object Data Management Group) has proposed a standard for object-oriented databases, including a standard object model, an object query language (OQL), and an object definition language (ODL). These do not include temporal support except at the data type level, as in SQL2. We present a language extension to OQL to accommodate time information. Our goal is not to propose a new temporal query language, but to incorporate temporal features into the existing OQL framework.", "authors": ["Leonidas Fegaras", "Ramez Elmasri"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0815c2f8-8e38-4d7c-a08d-52c93f7b98b5", "2cdc4530-3547-4d2a-9700-21df9472096a", "3a4b6f6e-bd4b-4da2-8c97-d9da785e86d5", "432bb54d-814f-402b-b59c-5847bf1c4e83", "47f3b62f-43dc-4a17-bd5e-91e5a22298c0", "5047d78e-e734-4af9-8ca9-9de6086711e6", "98c0c8bb-a00a-4f7e-bdef-5b86fa7aaf48", "c6b417a5-8922-4ee7-bf69-8b14b2df00a1"], "title": "A temporal object query language", "venue": "", "year": 1998, "id": "b8bee3f8-fa61-4863-ad87-7cdec230ee66"}
{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#Integration of data from autonomous, distributed and heterogeneous data sources poses several technical challenges. This paper overviews the data integration system AMOS II based on the wrapper-mediator approach. AMOS II consists of: (i) a mediator database engine that can process and execute queries over data stored locally and in several external data sources, and (ii) object-oriented (OO) multi-database views for reconciliation of data and schema heterogeneities among sources with various capabilities. The data stored in different types of data sources is translated and integrated using OO mediation primitives, providing the user with a consistent view of the data in all the sources. Through its multi-database facilities many distributed AMOS II systems can interoperate in a federation. Since most data reside in the data sources, and to achieve high performance, the core of the system is a main-memory DBMS having a storage manager, query optimizer, transactions, client\u2013server interface, disk backup, etc. The AMOS II data manager is optimized for main-memory access and is extensible so that new data types and query operators can be added or implemented in some external programming language. The extensibility is essential for providing seamlessaccess to a variety of data sources.

{"abstract": "We introduce the problem of compressing partially ordered strings: given string \u03c3 \u2208 \u03a3 \u2217 and a binary independence relation I over \u03a3, how can we compactly represent an input if the decompressor is allo- wed to reconstruct any string that can be obtained from \u03c3 by repeatedly swapping adjacent independent symbols? Such partially ordered strings are also known as Mazurkiewicz traces, and naturally model executi- ons of concurrent programs. Compression techniques have been applied with much success to sequential program traces not only to store them compactly but to discover important profiling patterns within them. For compression to achieve similar aims for concurrent program traces we should exploit the extra freedom provided by the independence relation. Many popular string compression schemes are grammar-based schemes that produce a small context-free grammar generating uniquely the given string. We consider three classes of strategies for compression of partially- ordered strings: (i) we adapt grammar-based schemes by rewriting the input string \u03c3 into an \"equivalent\" one before applying grammar-based string compression, (ii) we represent the input by a collection of projec- tions before applying (i) to each projection, and (iii) we combine (i) and (ii) with relabeling of symbols. We present some natural algorithms for each of these strategies, and present some experimental evidence that the extra freedom does enable extra compression. We also prove that a strategy of projecting the string onto each pair of dependent symbols can indeed lead to exponentially more succinct representations compared with only rewriting, and is within a factor of |\u03a3| 2 of the optimal strategy for combining projections with rewriting.", "authors": ["Rajeev Alur", "Swarat Chaudhuri", "Kousha Etessami", "Sudipto Guha", "Mihalis Yannakakis"], "n_citation": 114, "references": ["136c4780-2f25-4068-90a5-aed6afaf2890", "1e91d73d-9ddd-4702-a609-a31d852d9eb9", "21b24422-734c-458e-816b-e86df012dca2", "2891aa58-33a5-4159-84e0-9969f199facc", "29cc5a0a-3aa9-4be6-97ed-e7a26c84901d", "41cf9713-ed76-43a6-8e9f-538abc2f787c", "44144d3e-4931-4159-8145-012ad1e9a782", "5b581c14-442b-45e5-8bb9-dcad654bb069", "63043169-564a-41de-8919-261c0550a4a0", "6955a99b-479b-4790-8efa-7841628bf127", "7608517d-8268-446c-94cd-4135cc6eeab6", "b6a77e7c-7cf7-472f-b848-7ce1a9f054c2", "c0cfff6c-6070-4056-959c-a96955582e15", "d6285e34-13fa-4327-b4f9-203181baa8c6"], "title": "Compression of Partially Ordered Strings", "venue": "international conference on concurrency theory", "year": 2003, "id": "062a44a5-260c-429b-90e1-c73f23134ab8"}

{"abstract": "An objective technique to discriminate developing from nondeveloping cloud clusters during tropical cyclogenesis is described. Since vortices are characterized by high levels of organization or axisymmetry, their detection at early stages of the lifecycle of tropical cyclones makes it possible to determine when they form. To quantify the axisymmetry of a cloud cluster around a predefined radius, a statistical analysis of the orientation of the brightness-temperature gradient is performed. Results show that early detections of axisymmetric structures reliably indicate the cyclone genesis on an average of 0.6 h before an atmospheric disturbance becomes a tropical depression. In addition, the technique shows potential to discriminate nondeveloping from developing cloud clusters. A statistical analysis shows that a true-positive rate of detection of approximately 93% could be achieved with a false-alarm rate of 22%.", "authors": ["Miguel F. Pi\u00f1eros", "Elizabeth A.

{"abstract": "There is strong evidence that the current implementation of TCP will perform poorly in future high-speed networks. To address this problem many congestion control protocols have been proposed in literature which, however, fail to satisfy key design requirements of congestion control protocols, as these are outlined in the paper. In this work we develop an adaptive congestion protocol (ACP) which is shown to satisfy all the design requirements and thus outperform previous proposals. Extensive simulations indicate that the protocol is able to guide the network to a stable equilibrium which is characterized by max-min fairness, high-utilization, small queue sizes and no observable packet drops. In addition, it is found to be scalable with respect to changing bandwidths, delays and number of users utilizing the network. The protocol also exhibits nice transient properties such as smooth responses with no oscillations and fast convergence. In realistic traffic scenarios comprising of a small number of long flows and a large number of short flows, ACP outperforms both TCP and XCP, even in the presence of random packet losses. ACP does not require maintenance of per flow states within the network and utilizes an explicit multi-bit feedback signalling scheme. To maintain stability it implements at each link a novel estimation algorithm which estimates the number of flows utilizing the link. Using a simple network model, we show analytically the effectiveness of the estimation algorithm. We use the same model to generate phase portraits which demonstrate that the ACP protocol is stable for all delays.", "authors": ["Marios Lestas", "Andreas Pitsillides", "Petros A.

{"abstract": "Software companies are under continuous pressure to shorten time to market, raise quality and lower costs. More automated system testing could be instrumental in achieving these goals and in recent years testing tools have been developed to automate the interaction with software systems at the GUI level. However, there is a lack of knowledge on the usability and applicability of these tools in an industrial setting. This study evaluates two tools for automated visual GUI testing on a real-world, safety-critical software system developed by the company Saab AB. The tools are compared based on their properties as well as how they support automation of system test cases that have previously been conducted manually. The time to develop and the size of the automated test cases as well as their execution times have been evaluated. Results show that there are only minor differences between the two tools, one commercial and one open-source, but, more importantly, that visual GUI testing is an applicable technology for automated system testing with effort gains over manual system test practices. The study results also indicate that the technology has benefits over alternative GUI testing techniques and that it can be used for automated acceptance testing. However, visual GUI testing still has challenges that must be addressed, in particular the script maintenance costs and how to support robust test execution.", "authors": ["Emil B\u00f6rjesson", "Robert Feldt"], "n_citation": 56, "references": ["05d45cf4-b0dd-4f7c-bf39-745b2c21d156", "11705516-775e-4175-aa50-570b44f77b6f", "172a40fe-8167-4ffb-a1fe-e5ef7bf555c8", "185d0182-3fd0-4f7b-be3f-10585daa8c33", "2668b1d0-6389-465e-9398-a245056a6328", "49177332-af00-4c4f-a9be-0b88165877a4", "57e06968-a8e5-4aab-9288-1fc99446c784", "6198bce4-37f4-443d-9d05-57f485c3e1ab", "6ec2e142-1548-4cde-9d6c-1fc71c0cda95", "7686ba7c-a4dd-482c-8729-5ef6f0f04edf", "87b33807-28a6-49ce-9d5f-6b8b8be8ef68", "8fbf2d5d-f4de-4149-88dd-2f7d15681d96", "9bf16d6c-cd77-4f42-a971-c1e48af7d7a4", "9e6b1b04-8b88-4fa2-bb3b-eea47d1ea25d", "aabfabd3-3f59-4d39-aa4d-3f6770886ce0", "f0da0661-a305-4b3a-a5a3-4d1f6c77c1f7"], "title": "Automated System Testing Using Visual GUI Testing Tools: A Comparative Study in Industry", "venue": "international conference on software testing verification and validation", "year": 2012, "id": "e902642c-c5f5-40f4-a903-ce97c980722b"}

Within the framework of abstract compilation, the precision of a mode analysis depends, in part, on the expressiveness of the abstract domain and its associated abstraction function. This paper considers abstract domains for polymorphically typed logic programs and shows how specialised domains may be constructed for each type in the program. These domains capture the degree of instantiation to a high level of precision. By providing a generic definition of abstract unification, the abstraction of a program using these domains is formalised. The domain construction procedure is fully implemented using the Godel language and tested on a number of example programs to demonstrate the viability of the approach.", "authors": ["Jan-Georg Smaus", "Patricia M.

The results are based on the differential-algebraic representation of rational systems and a modified sector bound condition is applied to model the saturation effects.

Traditionally, parallel job scheduling policies have been designed to improve certain job performance metrics when scheduling parallel workloads on a system with a given number of processors. The available number of processors is not anymore the only limitation in parallel job scheduling. The recent increase in processor power consumption has resulted in a new limitation: the available power. Given constraints naturally lead to an optimization problem. We proposed MaxJobPerf, a new parallel job scheduling policy based on integer linear programming. Dynamic Voltage Frequency Scaling (DVFS) is a widely used technique that running applications at reduced CPU frequency/voltage trades increased execution time for power reduction. The optimization problem determines which jobs should run and at which frequency. In this paper, we compare the MaxJobPerf policy against other power budgeting policies for different power budgets. It clearly outperforms the other power-budgeting approaches at the parallel job scheduling level.

Thus, our proof is more rigorous than a traditional one.#R##N##R##N#Our effort turned out to be more than just an exercise in verification; having to definine rigorously all key concepts provided new mathematical insight into the concept of planarity.

{"abstract": "In this paper, general metrics of the energy-delay (E-D) tradeoff in digital VLSI circuits are discussed. More specifically, the general class of metrics E i D j  with arbitrary exponents is adopted and evaluated for various commercial microprocessors. Results indicate that practical circuits are designed by minimizing a wider range of metrics compared to the ED or ED 2  metrics usually assumed in the literature. Hence, the general metrics E i D j  describes the energy-delay tradeoff in a more realistic way. An interesting interpretation of the adopted metrics is provided to gain an insight into the relationship between energy and delay in energy-efficient designs.

{"abstract": "Understanding the behavior of molecular systems such as DNA and proteins is a central problem in the field of physical chemistry. Most research laboratories now have a collection of heterogeneous processing architectures which could be brought to bear on this problem - high end PCs, various different workstations, and time on high performance machines [8, 11, 20]. Much work is currently being done on programming tools to exploit the different architectures, but most of this work to date is aimed at the programmer, who must spend time learning how to use message passing or parallel object oriented languages. The research scientist wishes simply to run their simulations as fast as possible. The work of our group includes the design of an environment[18] for the production of parallel code implementing the simulation of complex polymers, proteins and DNA molecules.The problems encountered in simulations of polymers, DNA and proteins often have straightforward parallel realizations, since the domain can be decomposed either spatially or along the molecular chain, and then a simple extension of the serial algorithm applied (at least for molecular mechanics - Monte Carlo methods need a little more work to ensure the criterion of detailed balance is adhered to) [5, 6, 19]. However, since the problems are completely dynamic in nature, any such decomposition will lead to an inefficient parallelization after sometime. Dynamic load balancing must then be applied to increase a simulations efficiency.To resolve the problem several load-balancing techniques have been proposed for SIMD [2, 16] and MIMD [12, 21,23, 25] models. We can distinguish between static and dynamic techniques. In contrast to static load balancing, where the decision as to which processors the workload is allocated is fixed at compilation, dynamic load balancing takes the behavior of the application and the system characteristics into account to distribute fairly the workload among the available processors. Dynamic load balancing is also characterized by the manner in which data are exchanged and controlled. The control can be centralized [22, 4] or distributed [14, 28, 7]. Distributed load balancing strategies are incorporated to each node of the system so that each can make decisions independently of the others.The control phase is characterized by the collection of information on the state of the system, such as the load on a processor, the number of idle processors, etc., and the decision making (whether the system is balanced or not). This phase is often absent in dynamic distribution strategies for data-parallel applications [9, 10, 17, 24]. The distribution phase is the main body of all algorithms which are generally based on the following criteria: 1) fair distribution of load, 2) minimization of communication introduced by the new distribution, 3) efficiency of the distribution procedure for data migrating from overloaded nodes to under-loaded (efficient routing algorithm), 4) respecting the topology of the application, and 5) simplicity of the algorithm to reduce to a minimum the execution time of the algorithm.Problems in the area of molecular simulation, among others, can be characterized by the fact that some part of the problem topology remains fixed at least for large parts of the simulation. Chemically bonded monomer groups remain close to their neighbors for large parts of the simulation. Load balancing techniques that redistribute the problem domain without taking this fact into account lead to increased levels of communication, and to a reduction in efficiency.Our work is in developing topology preserving load balancing algorithms for MIMD machines, and in this paper we focus on the analysis and performance of one such algorithm, Positional Scan Load Balancing, and its suitability for use in the runtime system of the parallel simulation environment.", "authors": ["David F.

{"abstract": "The authors have studied the significance of non-Gaussian signal statistics in some synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images of the ocean surface. The study consisted of calculating the amplitude histogram of the returned echoes from the images and comparing these with the Rayleigh- and K/spl nu/-distributions, corresponding to the Gaussian and non-Gaussian statistics, respectively. The images used were some C-band SAR data from the Canadian airborne SAR collected during the NORCSEX'88 campaign and some ERS-1 data collected during the NORCSEX'91 campaign. The analysis of the NORCSEX'88 data included studies of the dependency of the signal statistics on incidence angle and meteorological and imaging conditions. It was found, specifically at small incidence angles, that there was a significant deviation from Gaussian statistics. It was also found that when the wind was blowing against the waves, the deviation from Gaussian statistics was more pronounced than when the wind was blowing in the same direction as the waves were propagating. The study also showed a correlation between the signal statistics and the width of the SAR image spectra. At low incidence angles, this agrees with the interpretation that non-Gaussian statistics may be related to strong widebanded scattering events. However, since non-Gaussian statistics also were observed at incidence angles as high as 50/spl deg/, it is evident that the modulation of the scattering cross section by the long waves is also an important factor. In addition, the analysis of the ERS-1 data showed that to account for the width of the SAR image spectra, an azimuth smearing term, due to short scene coherence time, had to be included. This was in the present work done by modeling the short-coherence-time-smearing as a Gaussian low-pass filter. By this procedure, the authors were able to obtain realistic estimates for the average scene coherence time of the SAR scenes.", "authors": ["Torbj\u00f8rn Eltoft", "Kjell Arild H\u00f8gda"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1043e40e-8601-4a29-8beb-74caaed96d29", "ed257ab3-37c5-4319-a440-c3226fcd919f"], "title": "Non-Gaussian signal statistics in ocean SAR imagery", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "year": 1998, "id": "b5fa4665-376e-4a7f-8c9a-a177a308e6a8"}

{"abstract": "Consider an ordered, static tree  T  where each node has a label from alphabet \u03a3. Tree  T  may be of arbitrary degree and shape. Our goal is designing a compressed storage scheme of  T  that supports basic  navigational  operations among the immediate neighbors of a node (i.e. parent,  i th child, or any child with some label,\u2026) as well as more sophisticated  path -based search operations over its labeled structure.   We present a novel approach to this problem by designing what we call the XBW-transform of the tree in the spirit of the well-known Burrows-Wheeler transform for strings [1994]. The XBW-transform uses path-sorting to linearize the labeled tree  T  into  two  coordinated arrays, one capturing the structure and the other the labels. For the first time, by using the properties of the XBW-transform, our compressed indexes go beyond the information-theoretic lower bound, and support navigational and path-search operations over labeled trees within (near-)optimal time bounds and entropy-bounded space.   Our XBW-transform is simple and likely to spur new results in the theory of tree compression and indexing, as well as interesting application contexts. As an example, we use the XBW-transform to design and implement a compressed index for XML documents whose compression ratio is significantly better than the one achievable by state-of-the-art tools, and its query time performance is order of magnitudes faster.", "authors": ["Paolo Ferragina", "Fabrizio Luccio", "Giovanni Manzini", "S.

A difficulty with such a strategy arises due to the interaction between the different control loops, which may cause the control action in a loop to give rise to significant disturbances in other loops. This paper presents a new robust PI tuning procedure for multi-loop control systems which aims to decouple the different channels of the multivariable system and to guarantee the tracking response performance and measurement noise attenuation, using a reference model approximation scheme. The control problem is formulated as a non-convex multi-objective optimization problem which is formulated directly in the space of PI controller parameters.

{"abstract": "Vulnerabilities are weaknesses in the requirements, design, and implementation, which attackers exploit to compromise the system. This paper proposes a vulnerability-centric modeling ontology, which aims to integrate empirical knowledge of vulnerabilities into the system development process. In particular, we identify the basic concepts for modeling and analyzing vulnerabilities and their effects on the system. These concepts drive the definition of criteria that make it possible to compare and evaluate security frameworks based on vulnerabilities. We show how the proposed modeling ontology can be adopted in various conceptual modeling frameworks through examples.", "authors": ["Golnaz Elahi", "Eric S. K.

{"abstract": "This paper introduces the notion of higher-order inheritance hierarchies. They are useful because they provide well-known benefits of object-orientation at the level of entire hierarchies-benefits which are not available with current approaches. Three facets must be adressed: First, it must be possible to create hierarchies incrementally based on existing hierarchies, such that commonalities are expressed via reuse, not duplication. Second, the hierarchies must themselves be organized into hierarchies, such that their relationships are made explicit and can be exploited in a type safe manner. Finally, it must be possible to write generic code that works on every hierarchy derived from the hierarchy for which it was written. This paper presents a language design that supports such a notion of higher-order hierarchies. It has been implemented in context of a full-fledged, statically typed language.", "authors": ["Erik Ernst"], "n_citation": 101, "references": ["05c211d9-287e-4baf-bd61-d16301b2cda3", "23c82e3b-76e3-401a-835b-7b7cc9e708c0", "3f611783-533e-45fd-ba8a-08b94b3a9d66", "47496e1d-4d74-4f2f-96cd-fb172fa565fe", "47fae707-74ec-434c-921b-06f8b57bf81d", "5a809d80-35d7-441d-983f-bcbbc329d4d9", "886316f0-1635-46bd-a3d0-a1bd7a31c73b", "8b0b3938-8ab1-4a18-aa09-ab7569570eb5", "b1199ccc-0609-493a-9b40-ada03b9dcd6f", "b4e2677a-a9e6-46c8-a328-47ed4813d336", "b8df4b8c-606d-4af1-b5d1-d9c8a3b8262c", "e2285510-fd4d-4b40-89ca-627a9ce7b76c", "e2299cdc-41d2-4f50-8a6a-e2cfe569c7ba", "f0192cee-e001-4fec-8f3d-3550856eefb5", "f81adf73-ef75-448c-b8e5-8d9f656d48eb", "fd781252-d2c5-4a5e-9b99-c049e7a18497"], "title": "Higher-Order Hierarchies", "venue": "european conference on object-oriented programming", "year": 2003, "id": "ee9f4053-1b58-4702-abe0-774df3fdb1cb"}
{"abstract": "In this paper, we report on the first edition of the HEp-2 Cells Classification contest, held at the 2012 edition of the International Conference on Pattern Recognition, and focused on indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) image analysis. The IIF methodology is used to detect autoimmune diseases by searching for antibodies in the patient serum but, unfortunately, it is still a subjective method that depends too heavily on the experience and expertise of the physician. This has been the motivation behind the recent initial developments of computer aided diagnosis systems in this field. The contest aimed to bring together researchers interested in the performance evaluation of algorithms for IIF image analysis: 28 different recognition systems able to automatically recognize the staining pattern of cells within IIF images were tested on the same undisclosed dataset. In particular, the dataset takes into account the six staining patterns that occur most frequently in the daily diagnostic practice: centromere, nucleolar, homogeneous, fine speckled, coarse speckled, and cytoplasmic. In the paper, we briefly describe all the submitted methods, analyze the obtained results, and discuss the design choices conditioning the performance of each method.", "authors": ["Pasquale Foggia", "Gennaro Percannella", "Paolo Soda", "Mario Vento"], "n_citation": 164, "references": ["02db3e76-fa2c-4c43-b57e-5fd934c49187", "047f11ce-6cc0-4504-8fd6-fa835c5a4095", "04c93846-4cb8-4d0f-9d0e-a315883c39e5", "0d746340-ac2c-4f18-b8f2-39ffff9a9f21", "146f7a83-cd21-499d-af56-580eda3f8ce8", "29b27984-ff06-4c52-a744-a205bad37fc4", "2ebfebc7-a20e-4e23-9386-4eb9e089ed32", "3a86b901-7e79-45c6-b2c8-ec21fe42fde6", "505e18bd-cb4f-422d-8e34-845bf6d47edb", "5871363a-27f0-495d-8013-c0077a417a89", "5ad90643-237f-4803-8c6d-78380ecf27c4", "5e7cf230-3c07-4881-a8fd-2a418fde6740", "602a0060-8423-4a6a-954b-42023e40f4cf", "63a5ec70-e6ea-4a49-ba9e-5c88edc8d694", "88d45e2d-6757-4064-b9ca-3f935e6a00cb", "9cef868f-eb6d-4189-acd1-43eac87cf81e", "b3ab1377-3048-4c43-88a5-e06b70c42250", "b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b", "c7ac5eb2-c61f-4c0b-a03a-28fd2c82cfc0", "d520b7c1-3aba-4817-87a8-35067a4b6aed", "dd83785a-dd19-41e3-9b25-ebabbd48d336", "f6f3e654-0ed1-4c88-807e-5bcde8e2f474"], "title": "Benchmarking HEp-2 Cells Classification Methods", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Medical Imaging", "year": 2013, "id": "8118ed53-c48d-4a47-9cf8-0a98faadd402"}

{"abstract": "Future systems of networked autonomous vehicles, such as unmanned aerial or ground vehicles, may rely on peer-to-peer wireless communication to coordinate their actions. The physical formation of the network may need to be reconfigured at times based on the specified missions. However, reconfiguring the physical formation also impacts the link connectivity and hence the connectivity of the network. If the network is partitioned, the autonomous vehicles can no longer coordinate their movements, and the mission may fail. In this article, we discuss techniques to transform the formation of a system of autonomous vehicles while preserving network connectivity. Several different approaches to address this problem are presented, with the focus on a method that utilizes ideas from routing packets in networks. We also briefly discuss the problem of formation selection and give an example of formation optimization in which communication costs are minimized under constraints on preserving network connectivity and the amount of movement required.", "authors": ["Leenhapat Navaravong", "Zhen Kan", "John M.

{"abstract": "Visual data analysis of time related data sets has attracted much research interest recently, and a number of sophisticated visualization methods have been proposed in the past. In financial analysis, however, the most important and most common visualization techniques for time series data is the traditional line- or bar chart. Although these are intuitive and make it easy to spot the effect of key events on a asset's price, and its return over a given period of time, price charts do not allow the easy perception of relative movements in terms of growth rates, which is the key feature of any price-related time series.#R##N##R##N#This paper presents a novel Growth Matrix visualization technique for analyzing assets. It extends the ability of existing chart techniques by not only visualizing asset return rates over fixed time frames, but over the full spectrum of all subintervals present in a given time frame, in a single view. At the same time, the technique allows a comparison of subinterval return rates among groups of even a few hundreds of assets. This provides a powerful way for analyzing financial data, since it allows the identification of strong and weak periods of assets as compared to global market characteristics, and thus allows a more encompassing visual classification into \"good\" and \"poor\" performers than existing chart techniques. We illustrate the technique by real-world examples showing the abilities of the new approach, and its high relevance for financial analysis tasks.", "authors": ["Daniel A.

Moreover, the new compositional structure opens the algorithm for modification: two further uni-directional analysis components exclude any unnecessary code motion.

{"abstract": "Many psychological studies have shown that when we act, and especially when we interact, we consciously and unconsciously attend to context of many types. Sensors can pick up some but not all context that is acquired through our senses. Some context is lost, some is added, and captured context is presented in new ways. Digital aggregators and interpreters do not aggregate and interpret the same way we do. Missing or altered context disrupts our processing of information in ways that we may not recognize. To address the disruption we may use additional sensors to capture and deliver some of the missing context. Learning to handle these new conduits is then a further source of disruption, and on it can go. With greater knowledge of context, we can work and interact more efficiently, assuming that we can learn to take advantage of the information without being overwhelmed. However, converting contextual information to a digital format changes it in specific ways. Transient information becomes more permanent, local information is made available globally, and information that once spread slowly can spread much more quickly. The information can enable us to work more efficiently, but these changes in its nature have profound indirect effects. The potential loss of privacy is widely discussed, but other effects may be more significant. In particular, the loss of confinement and transience of information creates an environment that is fundamentally unnatural, in conflict with the one we evolved to live in.", "authors": ["Jonathan Grudin"], "n_citation": 38, "references": ["1e02afa8-966c-4fa4-80e6-067c5949ae24", "28476530-3b80-42d2-b0d6-f7ddd3759faf", "3695a095-0fab-4141-bdc4-2d24cb097352", "413d976a-83b0-4cee-88b2-f9f3e24f0672", "50dfc853-2c66-412b-afb3-13446a007aac", "597dd9de-6568-4308-a315-b414660036be", "8cc9b6a0-4376-4e79-a83f-99267079b682", "b9efe806-c9e9-4c5c-9129-4cb2b25ecd0e", "cc0c8d22-3a7c-49d1-bd9a-ef32713b8b6c", "d84490aa-d4ef-4ddb-a6ec-8a09dcb44f01", "e2593748-76d0-41b2-ac6b-1f72abea0652", "e6af452d-492c-49f6-afa4-a578b7a8bcc6", "fd51d78a-e2f5-46b6-b041-4dae9aebdc76"], "title": "Desituating action: digital representation of context", "venue": "Human-Computer Interaction", "year": 2001, "id": "7b5c20f8-0972-42c9-96b2-908d42a702b1"}

Unfortunately, it is usually possible to deceive automatic fingerprint identification systems by presenting a well-duplicated synthetic or dismembered finger. This paper introduces one method to provide fingerprint vitality authentication in order to solve this problem. Detection of a perspiration pattern over the fingertip skin identifies the vitality of a fingerprint. Mapping the two-dimensional fingerprint images into one-dimensional signals, two ensembles of measures, namely static and dynamic measures, are derived for classification. Static patterns as well as temporal changes in dielectric mosaic structure of the skin, caused by perspiration, demonstrate themselves in these signals. Using these measures, this algorithm quantifies the sweating pattern and makes a final decision about vitality of the fingerprint by a neural network trained by examples.", "authors": ["Reza Derakhshani", "Stephanie Schuckers", "Lawrence A.

{"abstract": "The vision of Ubiquitous Computing [22] creates the world in which information is omnipresent, migrating seamlessly through the environment to be accessible whenever and wherever needed. Such a vision poses substantial challenges to information security and privacy protection.Unlike in traditional, static, execution environments, information in the Ubiquitous world is exposed, throughout its lifetime, to constantly varying security and privacy threats caused by the inherent dynamicity and unpredictability of the new computing environment and its mobility. Existing data protection mechanisms, built for non- or predictably slowly-changing environments, are unable to strike the balance in the information availability vs. security and privacy threat trade-off in the Ubiquitous world thus hindering the feasibility of the overall vision.In this paper, we present our initial work on a novel paradigm for information security and privacy protection in the ubiquitous world. We model security and privacy threats through sets of contextual attributes and mitigate the projected risks through proactive and reactive data format transformations, subsetting and forced migrations while trying to maximize information availability.

Moreover, their structure allows to access directly the relations of causal precedence, concurrency, and conflict between events. Here, we explore the data structure further, to determine the following relation: event a is said to reveal event b iff the occurrence of a implies that b inevitably occurs, too, be it before, after, or concurrently with a. Knowledge of reveals facilitates in particular the analysis of partially observable systems, in the context of diagnosis, testing, or verification; it can also be used to generate more concise representations of behaviours via abstractions. The reveals relation was previously introduced in the context of fault diagnosis, where it was shown that the reveals relation was decidable: for a given pair a; b in the unfolding U of a safe Petri net N, a finite prefix P of U is sufficient to decide whether or not a reveals b.

{"abstract": "Social networks have emerged as a critical factor in information dissemination, search, marketing, expertise and influence discovery, and potentially an important tool for mobilizing people. Social media has made social networks ubiquitous, and also given researchers access to massive quantities of data for empirical analysis.  These data sets offer a rich source of evidence for studying dynamics of individual and group behavior, the structure of networks and global patterns of the flow of information on them. However, in most previous studies, the structure of the underlying networks was not directly visible but had to be inferred from the flow of information from one individual to another. As a result, we do not yet understand dynamics of information spread on networks or how the structure of the network affects it.

{"abstract": "Research in Multi-Agents Systems (MAS) has been, from its outset, concerned with coordinating intelligent behavior among a collection of autonomous intelligent agents. In the last years the use of on-line learning approaches to achieve coordination has attracted an increasing attention. The purpose of this work is to use a Reinforcement Learning approach in the job of learning how to coordinate agent actions in a MAS, aiming to minimize the task execution time. To achieve this goal, a control agent with learning capabilities is introduced in an agent society. The domain on which the system is applied consists of visually guided assembly tasks such as picking up pieces, performed by a manipulator working in an assembly cell. Since RL requires a large amount of learning trials, the approach was tested in a simulated domain. From the experiments carried out we conclude that RL is a feasible approach leading to encouraging results.", "authors": ["Anna Helena Reali Costa", "Reinaldo A. C.

{"abstract": "A novel detection scheme against DDoS attack is proposed from a distributed perspective. The distributed end-hosts in the Internet are organized into a P2P network by Chord protocol for detection. The detection algorithm based on CUSUM and space similarity is deployed at each node in the P2P detection network.   The P2P-based detection network is adopted, which makes the scheme be able to scale to the situation with a large number of detection nodes. CUSUM-based detection at the end  -host   can detect the slight change   at the host. Thus it implements the early detection against DDoS attack, and relieves the detection burden at the victim end. It also can prevent the DDoS attack from forging and randomly changing the IP address, so it can locate the real attack hosts.   Node trust is introduced for abnormal   information broadcast  , which   can prevent network from congestion caused by malicious broadcast from malicious nodes. Abnormality detection among nodes based on space similarity can improve the detection accuracy. The experimental results indicate that the proposed scheme has better performance than CUSUM and time similarity algorithm individually deployed. It can reach as high as 96.1% detection rate and only 6.9% false positive rate. This P2P-based scheme can be applied to resolve the communication problem in other distributed application     system.", "authors": ["Zaihong Zhou", "Dongqing Xie", "Wei Xiong"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["156be8d9-7c09-4092-8b5b-4e34a46f165d", "5d621fd5-84c0-4b45-ad95-1622b575404d", "69bb8b54-c0b9-4ead-b8ca-565a9de7123a", "7667bdc8-370c-4a9f-a6b5-26364032f22a", "a5ee7af1-e95d-4810-b2db-fc0992515e4e", "bf5ca9ab-d484-45ab-9906-83f8d7695d21", "c38bbc80-f948-4c57-93de-79ccc5b51656", "ce5101a7-a50d-46d1-b53a-c9da48b1ca41", "e524ac11-8265-4763-9183-c719a7002dac", "fb075f5f-2821-4783-b316-90546c34d577"], "title": "A Novel Distributed Detection Scheme against DDoS Attack", "venue": "Journal of Networks", "year": 2009, "id": "d105cc67-3228-4853-b2b2-40e1a922ac36"}

{"abstract": "Due to the high proliferation of web services, selecting the best services from functional equivalent service providers have become a real challenge, where the quality of the services plays a crucial role. But quality is uncertain, therefore, several researchers have applied Fuzzy logic to address the imprecision of the quality of service (QoS) constraints. Furthermore, the service market is highly dynamic and competitive, where web services are constantly entering and exiting this market, and they are continually improving themselves due to the competition. Current fuzzy-based techniques are expert and/or consensus-based, and therefore too fragile, expensive, non-scalable and non-self-adaptive. In this paper we introduce a new methodology to support requesters in selecting Web services by automatically connecting imprecisely defined QoS constraints with overly precise service QoS offerings over the time. We address the dynamism of the market by using each time a modified fuzzy c-means module that allows providers to automatically organize themselves around the QoS levels. The advantage of our approach is that consumers can specify their QoS constraints without really knowing what are the current best quality ranges. We illustrate our approach with a case of study.", "authors": ["Romina Torres", "Hern\u00b4n Astudillo", "Rodrigo Salas"], "n_citation": 29, "references": ["137946c3-4910-4fa6-b314-386189c8024e", "1d4d106a-669f-4b20-9a7d-62742bab7553", "3a2df8cd-4c40-4e98-b4c2-dc8658212f26", "460f251c-4648-4a12-94eb-4fad48537b74", "5be95334-6462-407a-8f0a-3c970a011cff", "891e4964-a240-498e-8447-f7f899d61c06", "a2f7af58-0799-40e0-9884-addac36725af", "a96d3a81-c98c-4060-9724-dd3a4a2c3209", "d282a1fd-427a-4842-8a4c-77522263484f", "d84f537d-1415-4990-9a48-fd5cb69d180a", "efbb9812-e484-4216-8c2f-bbaac73157c2"], "title": "Self-Adaptive Fuzzy QoS-Driven Web Service Discovery", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "1c82ccba-c10b-463b-936f-6dda1f26e5d8"}
{"abstract": "Collision detection is of paramount importance for many applications in computer graphics and visualization. Typically, the input to a collision detection algorithm is a large number of geometric objects comprising an environment, together with a set of objects moving within the environment. In addition to determining accurately the contacts that occur between pairs of objects, one needs also to do so at real-time rates. Applications such as haptic force feedback can require over 1000 collision queries per second. We develop and analyze a method, based on bounding-volume hierarchies, for efficient collision detection for objects moving within highly complex environments. Our choice of bounding volume is to use a discrete orientation polytope (k-DOP), a convex polytope whose facets are determined by halfspaces whose outward normals come from a small fixed set of k orientations. We compare a variety of methods for constructing hierarchies (BV-trees) of bounding k-DOPs. Further, we propose algorithms for maintaining an effective BV-tree of k-DOPs for moving objects, as they rotate, and for performing fast collision detection using BV-trees of the moving objects and of the environment. Our algorithms have been implemented and tested. We provide experimental evidence showing that our approach yields substantially faster collision detection than previous methods.", "authors": ["James T. Klosowski", "Martin Held", "Joseph S. B.

{"abstract": "Scenario has been used to describe agent behaviors in the context of environment situations in the specification languages for agent-based systems, such as SLABS. It becomes an important language facility in the declaration of an agent for specifying its behaviors in its environment. Therefore, towards agent-oriented programming, it is necessary to introduce and implement scenario mechanism in programming languages. This paper reports our attempts to support the language facility from the view of programming languages, and presents an approach to facilitating the scenario mechanism in agent-oriented programming. The basic idea is to extend object-oriented programming language to support agent-oriented programming, where Java is chosen as the base language. Firstly, the language framework of agent-oriented programming, SLABSp is presented, mostly conforming to SLABS, whose syntax is extended based on Java. Scenario mechanism is introduced as the new feature in the programming language. Secondly, the underlying object models are defined to serve as the semantics of the language, where agents are modeled by a couple of objects. A compiler has been built to compile the agent-oriented programs into Java. A running platform has been constructed as the multiagent runtime environment of SLABSp.", "authors": ["Rui Shen", "Ji Wang", "Hong Zhu"], "n_citation": 9, "references": ["010f51f0-a715-4271-9866-b217e7b9a722", "1b06f2c2-fcc0-4e02-a4b7-3301f319b534", "5ff5401a-0dc8-4e2b-b5ad-e994b833c79c", "877c008b-eb22-4845-91e5-4e6224a7d977", "9666acf6-15ef-4ffe-a033-bddaa789a63d"], "title": "Scenario mechanism in agent-oriented programming", "venue": "asia-pacific software engineering conference", "year": 2004, "id": "3d6cb3eb-0eb4-4a8f-86d4-d609dd2d8818"}

We uncover a fundamental limit on the security of mix networks, showing that they cannot tolerate a majority of nodes being malicious.

{"abstract": "Recently, the recoverable robustness model has been introduced in the optimization area. This model allows to consider disruptions (input data changes) in a unified way, that is, during both the strategic planning phase and the operational phase. Although the model represents a significant improvement, it has the following drawback: we are typically not facing only one disruption, but many of them might appear one after another. In this case, the solutions provided in the context of the recoverable robustness are not satisfying.#R##N#In this paper we extend the concept of recoverable robustness to deal not only with one single recovery step, but with arbitrarily many recovery steps. To this aim, we introduce the notion of dynamic recoverable robustness problems. We apply the new model in the context of timetabling and delay management problems.

{"abstract": "Maskless optical lithography is a technique for writing patterns into an optically sensitive material (photoresist) without the use of a photomask. The patterning process involves exposing selected areas of the photoresist film to the sensitizing light to produce the desired pattern. Unfortunately, the exposure pattern required to produce the desired pattern (output) is not a simple function of the desired pattern due to the geometric properties and focusing limits of the optical beam. Thus, we seek a technique capable of generating an exposure pattern which will result in the desired pattern being transferred to the photoresist. This goal can be achieved by exploiting an inverse lithography technique (ILT) which has previously been used for mask design in micro-photolithography systems. The technique is carried out by interpreting process flow in terms of forward modelling and presenting a regularization term in a cost function of the optimization problem to approach an efficient solution. This reduction in computational complexity in parts of the optimization calculation, results in a much faster convergence than has been previously reported. Finally, the effectiveness of this method in terms of fidelity of the desired features and the time of the calculation are verified by computer simulation.", "authors": ["Omid Tayefeh Ghalehbeygi", "Garth Berriman", "Andrew J.
