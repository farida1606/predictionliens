{"abstract": "Our case study provides the most important conceptual lessons learned from the implementation of a Distributed Telecommunication Management System (DTMS), which controls a networked voice communication system. Major requirements for the DTMS are fault-tolerance against site or network failures, transactional safety, and reliable persistence. In order to provide distribution and persistence both transparently and fault-tolerant we introduce a two-layer architecture facilitating an asynchronous replication algorithm. Among the lessons learned are: component based software engineering poses a significant initial overhead but is worth it in the long term; a fault-tolerant naming service is a key requirement for fail-safe distribution; the reasonable granularity for persistence and concurrency control is one whole object; asynchronous replication on the database layer is superior to synchronous replication on the instance level in terms of robustness and consistency; semi-structured persistence with XML has drawbacks regarding consistency, performance and convenience; in contrast to an arbitrarily meshed object model, a accentuated hierarchical structure is more robust and feasible; a query engine has to provide a means for navigation through the object model; finally the propagation of deletion operation becomes more complex in an object-oriented model. By incorporating these lessons learned we are well underway to provide a highly available, distributed platform for persistent object systems.", "authors": ["Robert Smeikal", "Karl M.

This research proves that configuration plays a vital role in energy optimisation, node failure and network lifetime when designing a Tree WSN.

Our simulation results prove that a Progressive configuration has two advantages, over a Balanced configuration, which are less computations required to complete each process and more tolerance of node failures. These Progressive configuration advantages both lead to more energy efficiency compared to a Balanced configuration.

We show that the potential of TCLs in California is more than enough for both current and predicted near-future regulation requirements. Moreover, we estimate the cost and revenue of TCLs, discuss the qualification requirements and participation incentive methods, and present a practical control framework for TCLs to provide regulation service.

{"abstract": "Digital microfluidic biochip (DFMB) systems have been developed as a promising platform for Lab-on-chip systems that manipulate individual droplet of chemicals on a 2D planar array of electrodes. Because of the safety critical nature of the applications these devices are intended for high reliability and thereby dependability becomes a major issue for the design of DMFBs. Therefore, such devices are required to be tested frequently both off-line (e.g., post-manufacturing) and prior to each assay execution. Under both scenarios, testing is accomplished by routing one or more test droplets across the chip and recording their arrival at the scheduled destination. In this paper, we have proposed a new design of a droplet motion detector based on capacitive sensing, which can be manufactured with the cell electrodes for detection of the presence (arrival) of a droplet at a predetermined location. Using this sensor, we have further proposed a customized testing technique for a specified layout with an objective of 1) optimizing the total number of test droplets for testing a particular bioassay, 2) optimizing the number of dispensers, 3) minimizing the overall test completion time, 4) detection of a specific segment at fault within the given layout, and 5) optimizing the number of locations where the detectors are to be activated. The test simulation has been carried out on two testbenches of Benchmark suite III and the results are found to be encouraging compared to the existing methods.", "authors": ["Pranab Roy", "Hafizur Rahaman", "Partha Sarathi Gupta", "Parthasarathi Dasgupta"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["1a096dab-9e4c-435c-8641-aa6ded69c2f1", "1e25bf92-7248-4bd5-8f00-94e646215683", "1f96dd6a-91e3-4239-97b6-bfc0501dbe43", "3121d799-879d-4ee9-967a-9b9640fa91dd", "52a904ba-8f7e-4085-a0cd-375402aecfcf", "87ef1587-edef-4078-82fa-d9dbb17df782", "8d5923e2-360c-4513-b3da-fc6e19d7b2ff", "8e0dfdd5-00e3-497e-aea4-8cd720befcc9", "a5c4942a-1fc9-4b0c-9043-8a41d1daff4a", "c46e4836-6538-4ee5-87a6-6e1b5704369a", "cf7d8144-20a2-4b83-b2bb-f20e71d75a1c", "d40f572b-3c00-4e67-8e3b-714eec17a634", "e7cfcf5a-1abb-4749-a0e6-36877f6fc1bc", "f2b2b5ed-4b96-40e7-9771-cee8aad13d01"], "title": "A new customized testing technique using a novel design of droplet motion detector for digital microfluidic Biochip systems", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "4b392111-524d-41e9-ba2c-e2402e1bca73"}

{"abstract": "We propose a novel fine-grained causal inference technique. Given two executions and some observed differences between them, the technique reasons about the causes of such differences. The technique does so by state replacement, i.e. replacing part of the program state at an earlier point to observe whether the target differences can be induced. It makes a number of key advances: it features a novel execution model that avoids undesirable entangling of the replaced state and the original state; it properly handles differences of omission by symmetrically analyzing both executions; it also leverages a recently developed slicing technique to limit the scope of causality testing while ensuring that no relevant state causes can be missed. The application of the technique on automated debugging shows that it substantially improves the precision and efficiency of causal inference compared to state of the art techniques.", "authors": ["William N.

{"abstract": "The classical definition of pair programming (PP) describes it via two obvious roles: driver (the person currently having the keyboard) and observer (the other, alternatively called navigator). Although prior research has found some assumptions regarding these roles to be false, so far no alternative PP role model took hold. Instead, most PP research tacitly assumes the classical model to be true and thus PP to be no more difficult than solo programming. We perform qualitative research (using Grounded Theory Methodology) to find a more realistic role model, and have uncovered a suprising complexity: There are more than two roles, they are assumed and unassumed gradually, multiple roles can be held by one person at the same time, and some of their facets are subtle. Mastering this complexity requires specific PP skills beyond mere programming and communication skills. By ignoring such skills, previous PP studies (in particular the controlled experi- ments) have investigated a rather mixed bag of situations, which explains their heterogeneous results. The emerging result is that qualitative research on the PP process will lead to constructive behavioral advice (process patterns) for pair members and to more meaningful designs for quantitative PP research.", "authors": ["Stephan Salinger", "Franz Zieris", "Lutz Prechelt"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["10aae0d3-3c25-43ed-ab4c-5393933be347", "8cf2730e-a504-4eab-8ccf-d50bb26d0c51", "9a1d88e2-1bf3-4324-8f7e-84989d6b9837", "a65c12e6-e0a8-428f-8d15-e694f5afd37d", "af26a993-df53-43f0-9134-593fcc127856", "b051425b-d077-4b71-8278-d6d17d13bf51", "fe706642-e668-4ea7-b85f-32818aa71c6e"], "title": "Liberating pair programming research from the oppressive Driver/Observer regime", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "4b866ff9-40f1-4eb6-8891-2be74c69c560"}

{"abstract": "Introduction    Because of the web's rapid growth and lack of central organization, Internet search engines play a vital role in assisting the users of the Web in retrieving relevant information out of the tens of billions of documents available. With millions of dollars of potential revenue at stake, commercial Web sites compete fiercely to be placed prominently within the first page returned by a search engine. As a result, search engine optimizers (SEOs) developed various forms of search engine spamming (or spamdexing) techniques to artificially inflate the rankings of Web pages. Link-based ranking algorithms, such as Google's PageRank, have been largely effective against most conventional spamming techniques.   However, PageRank has three fundamental flaws that, when exploited aggressively, can be proven to be its Achilles' heel: First, PageRank gives a minimum guaranteed score to every page on the Web; second, it rewards all incoming links as valid endorsements; and third, it imposes no penalty for making links to low-quality pages. SEOs can take advantage of these shortcomings to the extreme by employing an Artificial Web, a collection of an extremely large number of computer-generated Web pages containing many links to only a few target pages. Each page of the Artificial Web collects the minimum PageRank and feeds it back to the target pages. Although the individual endorsements are small, the flaws of PageRank make it possible for an Artificial Web to accumulate sizable PageRank values for the target pages. The SEOs can even download a substantial portion of the real Web and modify only the destinations of the hyperlinks, thus circumventing any detection algorithms based on the quality or the size of pages. As the size of an Artificial Web can be comparable to that of the real Web, SEOs can seriously compromise the objectivity of the results that PageRank provides. Although some statistical measures can be employed to identify specific attributes associated with an Artificial Web and filter them out of search results, it is far more desirable to develop a new ranking model that is free of such exploits to begin with.", "authors": ["Rohit Kaul", "Yeogirl Yun", "Seong-Gon Kim"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["086c801b-78cb-4c87-a0dd-90f38b18fbc7", "2e499e1a-df4d-4149-888b-0cd98980e5ed", "5bf5a964-8f0e-462f-aff5-716cfa0083d0", "7fec69a4-1b8b-4a36-8756-84baeeed5e99", "8f9e92cf-f266-4e51-807f-c098a260a0dc", "a23effc2-0dad-40ee-b1d0-0375bf76fc8e", "c7e4e04b-45da-4bae-8c8a-d17ca0087361", "e31917d8-c25b-4511-8aa4-33e1cbb2f531", "e65c47a5-ecf9-4dc1-8436-50e692ff1a12"], "title": "Ranking billions of web pages using diodes", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2009, "id": "4b89e1a0-0785-4614-8663-f2f715e350c4"}

{"abstract": "It is difficult to visualize the behaviour of an embedded system in its operational environment from a specification of the system alone. However, it is unacceptable to wait for system completion before validating its behaviour. Discrete event simulation is an effective technique for making quantitative predictions about system behaviour, provided that the model is derived carefully from the system specification. We summarize the steps involved in deriving an Ada **  simulation program from a JSD function step specification, using a lift system as an illustration. Having used this technique, we conclude that while it is time-consuming and not amenable to automation in the near future, it is cost-effective because it helps to elucidate counter-intuitive interactions between system functions and environmental parameters.", "authors": ["Colin Potts", "Andy Bartlett", "B.

{"abstract": "For the analysis of highly configurable systems, analysis approaches need to take the inherent variability of these systems into account. The notion of presence conditions is central to such approaches. A  presence condition  specifies a subset of system configurations in which a certain artifact or a concern of interest is present (e.g., a defect associated with this subset). In this paper, we introduce and analyze the problem of  presence-condition simplification.  A key observation is that presence conditions often contain redundant information, which can be safely removed in the interest of simplicity and efficiency.

{"abstract": "We present a study were software systems are considered as complex networks which have a self-similar structure under a length-scale transformation. On such complex software networks we computed a self-similar coefficient, also known as fractal dimension, using \"the box counting method\".   We analyzed various releases of the publically available Eclipse software systems, calculating the fractal dimension for twenty sub-projects, randomly chosen, for every release, as well as for each release as a whole. Our results display an overall consistency among the sub-projects and among all the analyzed releases.   We found a very good correlation between the fractal dimension and the number of bugs for Eclipse and for twenty sub-projects. Since the fractal dimension is just a scalar number that characterizes a whole system, while complexity and quality metrics are in general computed on every system module, this result suggests that the fractal dimension could be considered as a global quality metric for large software systems.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a novel energy-aware and temperature-aware programming model with first-class support for  sustainability.  A program written in the new language, named Eco, may adaptively adjusts its own behaviors to stay on a given (energy or temperature) budget, avoiding both deficit that would lead to battery drain or CPU overheating, and surplus that could have been used to improve the quality of results. Sustainability management in Eco is captured as a form of supply and demand matching, and the language runtime consistently maintains the equilibrium between supply and demand. Among the efforts of energy-adaptive and temperature-adaptive systems, Eco is distinctive in its role in bridging the programmer and the underlying system, and in particular, bringing both programmer knowledge and application-specific traits into energy optimization. Through a number of intuitive programming abstractions, Eco reduces challenging issues in this domain --- such as workload characterization and decision making in adaptation --- to simple programming tasks, ultimately offering fine-grained, programmable, and declarative sustainability to energy-efficient computing. Eco is an minimal extension to Java, and has been implemented as an open-source compiler. We validate the usefulness of Eco by upgrading real-world Java applications with energy awareness and temperature awareness.", "authors": ["Haitao Steve Zhu", "Chaoren Lin", "Yu David Liu"], "n_citation": 20, "references": ["0312f7c0-77e4-4094-bdf7-9a2e7f249569", "03177bf6-b01a-44c0-bb52-04d168e823d1", "04a41ead-7a75-41a5-94a6-c70ed06e4233", "05ebc39b-f191-46b5-92b3-aaa92d1940d1", "12fca062-da63-466a-a34b-1b569d07fd03", "18775706-feee-47e4-ab18-425060bdd733", "1f3ada49-5cbf-41dd-8558-b5adfb688737", "278b1337-c0c5-4dae-94f0-b97559297c32", "3648c33e-28a6-45ca-b755-4f21cf5ab939", "3c8020ac-b046-4741-9fe8-6f48b742d81a", "3dd459bf-d062-4bd6-b440-4801967bb371", "3fc8d8b4-a8b0-4385-9d68-f7e22586d267", "4776b226-a3d8-4f62-9409-8300ce5370f5", "51ccea0d-97fe-4bc6-9e48-741cc3f4122b", "56402ac9-8383-47be-b60b-4c94f275f7dd", "5becce8c-bdb9-4d1f-8e55-0d4bcc999090", "65a57d46-971a-40dc-8e4f-d7021935f822", "6849c15a-738e-45b9-8085-9d37a4589458", "6e988692-d67c-46f8-95a4-2e9cdf215980", "78ee470c-8ec1-4512-8ebe-7c6331c9fe70", "7cc0e762-2e36-4548-aabd-c0f2495263c5", "8ddd9bd3-b269-4728-ac4d-82aebe0e825e", "90757997-14d3-4ff9-af7c-df82ee06841f", "99285b6c-c691-429d-810a-edce5af96ec3", "9f2c2b3b-c639-4b3b-8018-e30f52e11c11", "a6b45538-ba82-4eb6-a722-ca8a106d79f5", "ab0a584e-e700-4a4c-988f-6afecfba123e", "b1aceba9-1228-4628-b20a-84e7a31dc887", "c307cd11-3ea6-42c5-ab88-d5e07c59f7c0", "c5ca1ea5-b790-4bac-b020-34477d38ff09", "e8a36a78-5fdc-4201-b5ab-b0603da95906", "ec2c4ab3-af8e-430c-802b-6f5a7ff4d71b", "f2a94cfa-63d1-436a-947c-aae9f6092842"], "title": "A programming model for sustainable software", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "4bf9ffff-46f9-4804-854a-19a56b50a85d"}

Unlike methods based on a common Lyapunov function, our stability results can be applied to systems with unstable consequents and our controllers can be designed for systems with unstabilizable consequents. Sufficient stability conditions are derived using the comparison principle and the Dini derivative. The stability results are used to design continuous-time fuzzy proportional controllers and fuzzy PI controllers. We provide examples to demonstrate our controller design.

This paper looks into the energy savings at the supply fan which takes up to 30% of HVAC in- building energy consumption, while energy consumptions at the chilled water pump and the chiller are also taken into account. By elongating the cooling process, the energy consumption can be significantly reduced due to the nonlinear feature of the fan power consumption. To ensure that a computed assignment of mass flow rates is practically feasible, we present an efficient way to check whether there exist a fan supply pressure and room damper openings to realize those mass flow rates.

{"abstract": "We provide efficient algorithms to calculate first and second order gradients of the cost of a control law with respect to its parameters, to speed up policy optimization. We achieve robustness by simultaneously designing one control law for multiple models with potentially different model structures, which represent model uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics. Providing explicit examples of possible unmodeled dynamics during the control design process is easier for the designer and is more effective than providing simulated perturbations to increase robustness, as is currently done in machine learning. Our approach supports the design of deterministic nonlinear and time varying controllers for both deterministic and stochastic nonlinear and time varying systems, including policies with internal state such as observers or other state estimators. We highlight the benefit of control laws made up of collections of simple policies where only one component policy is active at a time.

For such systems, we aim to adapt the placement of software components on networked hardware components at runtime without violating real-time constraints. We develop constraints for such an adaptation process and show the applicability to networked embedded systems like automotive in-vehicle networks. Then, we analyze two approaches for finding solutions in the resulting search space for adaptations, one based on planning algorithms and the other based on constraint solving. While planning approaches start from the current configuration and aim to find a migration sequence and a valid configuration, constraint solving approaches first find solutions and then check for a possible migration sequence.

(2) Massively multithreaded architectures, such as graphics processing units (GPUs), attempt to hide the high latency to memory by rapidly switching between many threads directly in hardware. This paper explores the intersection of these two techniques. We study the effect of accelerating highly parallel workloads with significant locality on a massively multithreaded GPU. We observe that the memory access stream seen by on-chip caches is the direct result of decisions made by the hardware thread scheduler. Our work proposes a hardware scheduling technique that reacts to feedback from the memory system to create a more cache-friendly access stream. We evaluate our technique using simulations and show a significant performance improvement over previously proposed scheduling mechanisms. We demonstrate the effectiveness of scheduling as a cache management technique by comparing cache hit rate using our scheduler and an LRU replacement policy against other scheduling techniques using an optimal cache replacement policy.", "authors": ["Timothy G.

{"abstract": "The problem of stabilizing steady gliding is very critical for an underwater glider, which is subject to many non-negligible disturbances from the aquatic environment. Traditional control methods like PID control, LQR control or torque control, can not provide simultaneously easy controller implementation and fast convergence speed for stabilization. In paper we propose a new nonlinear, passivity-based controller for the stablization problem. The controller is designed based on an approximation of a reduced model that is obtained through singular perturbation analysis, and consequently, it does not require full state feedback and is thus easy to implement. The local stability of the closed-loop full system is established through linearization. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate that the proposed controller achieves rapid convergence in stabilization.", "authors": ["Feitian Zhang", "Xiaobo Tan", "Hassan K.

{"abstract": "In recent years, as the usage of internet increases, new type of attacks on network information is also increasing continuously. Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is an important component that provides security to the network information by identifying various kinds of attacks occurring in the networks. Currently, there are many researches who are working in this area and they focus on developing effective IDS using machine learning techniques. However, there is a need for better systems with improved detection accuracy and reduced false alarm rate. In this paper, we propose an Intelligent IDS using fuzzy rough set based C4.5 classification algorithm to improve the detection accuracy. This system has been compared with Support Vector Machines for illustrating the improvement with respect to the detection accuracy. The inputs to these classifiers were preprocessed using a fuzzy rough set based outlier detection algorithm. In this work, we used the KDD'99 Cup dataset for carrying out the simulation of the experiments. The experimental results obtained in this work show that the proposed model reduces the false alarm rate and improves overall detection accuracy.", "authors": ["N.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of synthesizing a robust switching controller for nonlinear hybrid systems to guarantee that the trajectories of the system satisfy a high level specification expressed in linear temporal logic. Two different types of finite transition systems, namely under-approximations and over-approximations, that abstract the behavior of the underlying continuous dynamical system are defined. Using these finite abstractions, it is possible to leverage tools from logic and automata theory to synthesize discrete mode sequences or strategies. In particular, we show that the discrete synthesis problem for an under-approximation can be reformulated as a model checking problem and that for an over-approximation can be transformed into a two-player game, which can then be solved by using off-the-shelf tools. By construction, existence of a discrete switching strategy for the discrete synthesis problem guarantees the existence of a continuous switching protocol for the continuous synthesis problem, which can be implemented at the continuous level to ensure the correctness of the trajectories for the nonlinear hybrid system. Moreover, in the case of over-approximations, it is shown that one can easily accommodate specifications that require reacting to possibly adversarial external events within the same framework.", "authors": ["Junjun Liu", "Necmiye Ozay", "Ufuk Topcu", "Richard M.

{"abstract": "In hierarchical search the data structure holding the file keys is partitioned into substructures of the same type; these are searched consecutively until the queried key is found or the substructures are exhausted. The interest here is in the conditions under which the performance of a hierarchical organization of static files is superior to that of the nonhierarchical organization and in the construction of the hierarchy when these conditions are met. The performance criterion is the average number of comparisons in a successful search, where averaging extends over all keys and over all permutations of the key's access probabilities. General properties of hierarchical search are first derived, and attention is then focused on the hierarchical binary organization\u2014the special case where each of the data substructures is a sorted array (or a balanced binary tree) and where the keys are accessed by binary search. It is shown that an advantageous two-stage hierarchy is always implementable when the keys' access density function  \u03c6 ( i ) is \u201csteeper\u201d than Zipf's density function  z ( i )\u2014the steeper it is, the greater the advantage. A simple method for constructing the two-stage hierarchy is formulated, based on finding the intersection of  \u03c6 ( i ) and  z ( i ). For the  r -stage hierarchical organization, partitioning procedures are proposed which are based on the iterative application of the two-stage techniques.", "authors": ["Arthur Gill"], "n_citation": 50, "references": [], "title": "Hierarchical binary search", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 1980, "id": "4d0fa16e-474a-4fcb-b9b1-b66ac05c575d"}
{"abstract": "Software engineering project courses where student teams are geographically distributed can effectively simulate the problems of globally distributed software development (DSD). However, this pedagogical model has proven difficult to adopt or sustain. It requires significant pedagogical resources and collaboration infrastructure. Institutionalizing such courses also requires compatible and reliable teaching partners. The purpose of this workshop is to continue building on our outreach efforts to foster a community of international faculty and institutions committed to developing, teaching and researching DSD. Foundational materials presented will include pedagogical materials and infrastructure developed and used in teaching DSD courses along with results and lessons learned. The third CTGDSD workshop will also focus on publishing workshop results and collaborating with the larger DSD community.

{"abstract": "The Q system provides interoperability support for multilingual, heterogeneous component-based software systems. Initial development of Q began in 1988, and was driven by the very pragmatic need for a communication mechanism between a client program written in Ada and a server written in C. The initial design was driven by language features present in C, but not in Ada, or vice-versa. In time our needs and aspirations grew and Q evolved to support other languages, such as C++, Lisp, Prolog, Java, and Tcl. As a result of pervasive usage by the Arcadia SDE research project, usage levels and modes of the Q system grew and so more emphasis was placed upon portability, reliability, and performance. In that context we identified specific ways in which programming language support systems can directly impede effective interoperability. This necessitated extensive changes to both our conceptual model and our implementation of the Q system. We also discovered the need to support modes of interoperability far more complex than the usual client-server. The continued evolution of Q has allowed the architecture of Arcadia software to become highly distributed and component-based, exploiting components written in a variety of languages. In addition to becoming an Arcadia project mainstay, and has also been made available to over 100 other sites, and it is currently in use in a variety of other projects. This paper summarizes key points that have been learned from this considerable base of experience.", "authors": ["Mark Maybee", "Dennis Heimbigner", "Leon J.

{"abstract": "Trust plays a crucial role in the analysis, synthesis and operation of the integrated system consisting of social-cognitive, information and communication networks. Multi-agent systems and associated coalition operations, which involve two or more organizations, further augment the diversity and complexity of network interactions. Trust and its derivative notions affect dramatically the networked coalition operations. A substantial part of the research challenge has to do with the multitude of meanings, interpretations, symbolisms and mathematical models used to represent and analyze trust. In this paper, we introduce value directed graphs with weighted nodes as our model for composite trust. We extend the value directed graph with weighted nodes composite trust model to include not only numerical weights, but also constraints.

{"abstract": "Regression occurs when code changes introduce failures in previously passing test cases. As software evolves, regressions may be introduced. Fixing regression errors manually is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose an approach of automated repair of software regressions, called  relifix , that considers the regression repair problem as a problem of reconciling problematic changes. Specifically, we derive a set of code transformations obtained from our manual inspection of 73 real software regressions; this set of code transformations uses syntactical information from changed statements. Regression repair is then accomplished via a search over the code transformation operators -- which operator to apply, and where. Our evaluation compares the repairability of  relifix  with GenProg on 35 real regression errors.  relifix  repairs 23 bugs, while GenProg only fixes five bugs. We also measure the likelihood of both approaches in introducing new regressions given a reduced test suite. Our experimental results shows that our approach is less likely to introduce new regressions than GenProg.", "authors": ["Shin Hwei Tan", "Abhik Roychoudhury"], "n_citation": 43, "references": ["0015b9c4-cade-4f7b-bf65-453b2519104c", "0ed73fc7-0a43-4035-baeb-2ae130c184d5", "1b8d0ed9-80aa-4851-bf27-f70f91eb9fd4", "1c6e60c5-fc78-4df6-b6b1-04fa14adc9c5", "2d1ea183-408d-481d-9da3-ecd8b65a5dd7", "30521aed-580e-4260-8074-24f470294419", "3e8ddab5-30cf-486a-8cc0-06c1d48642b6", "5b44c094-7454-428b-b18a-012b8a491fea", "65b877b5-8165-4009-a950-2df93b25a636", "65d031b9-2a84-43d9-a23a-300bcccad40d", "69958fd7-7886-4fa4-9ae7-3f08ee3d08a8", "6c53d105-48f2-4ebe-b2eb-406dacc99be1", "6e8ea39b-5d8f-43e5-9663-84abb1b52da6", "7f3a86be-fad4-4ba1-b4aa-ec512b3bff90", "922494b7-4ffa-4896-a48d-711c955bad93", "9d5ca5e1-2389-4a1f-8d3e-8bd1f72a3be5", "a551bb2a-8f29-4e01-b4b4-a0d1befa7a53", "a6260ebd-32cc-4509-bdc2-91f35d607a72", "abbdbb83-7b29-45b1-8c9f-8593d7194493", "ad2b5534-d83c-43c4-96bd-1b2e7bb46fba", "b002d517-0f60-418d-86c6-5509cf9bc9a0", "b2d83f7c-0baa-41dd-b9d7-2830cb25decc", "b352cc5f-e1b8-46b8-8901-64af5e29c6a6", "c19953b2-4729-4691-a16d-c391661b2796", "c27d9399-f699-4c9f-a22d-6c7dd7548ccc", "cb7365af-cfd7-4e0c-a22b-806ea5db3dc1", "db6f9232-df5a-4a76-bad2-a892b9402554", "e49e4496-5216-426e-81e7-7db3407b5287", "e9d81875-89f0-44fe-a390-72e2590fbc46"], "title": "relifix : automated repair of software regressions", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "4d5d006c-c27f-4a9e-8a07-f82c798d5fed"}

{"abstract": "Governance rules in software development projects help to prioritize and manage their development tasks, and contribute to the long-term sustainability of the project by clarifying how core and external contributors should collaborate in order to advance the project during its whole lifespan. Despite their importance, specially in Open Source Software (OSS) projects, these rules are usually implicit or scattered in the project documentation/tools (e.g., Tracking-systems or forums), hampering the correct understanding of the development process.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we study the controllability of nonlinear networked systems. In particular, we describe how graph symmetries combined with dynamic symmetries result in a loss of controllability in nonlinear leader-follower networks. Our result generalizes those of Rahmani et al. (2009) who considered the case of a linear consensus-type dynamics, namely the unweighted Laplacian network flow. We consider several nonlinear network control systems that have been previously studied in the literature and characterize the presence of leader-follower graph symmetries that result in the lack of controllability. I. INTRODUCTION symmetries for various examples, including the absolute, relative, and disagreement nonlinear flows and also the virus spreading dynamics. We then introduce the notion of leader-follower network flow. As our second contribution, we give a necessary condition for controllability of general networked control systems with real-analytic flows. Among other things, this result demonstrates that the existing ob- structions to controllability in the literature on multi-agent systems are instances of lack of accessibility. As our last contribution, we present a suit of examples, including the loss of controllability in spite of dynamic asymmetry and loss of controllability in spite of leader symmetry, demonstrating that these results are far from being sufficient, even when lack of accessibility is concerned. We suggest some future directions for improving these results in our conclusion section. Organization: Section II contains preliminaries on graph theory and nonlinear controllability. In Section III, we in- troduce and study the symmetries of a network dynamical system in terms of the automorphisms of its underlying graph. Section IV contains our results on controllability of nonlinear networked control systems. Finally, Section V gathers our conclusions and ideas for future work.", "authors": ["Cesar O.

{"abstract": "The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is the de facto standard for designing and architecting software systems. UML offers a large number of diagram types that can be used with varying degree of rigour. As a result UML models may contain consistency defects. Previous research has shown that industrial UML models that are used as basis for implementation and maintenance contain large numbers of defects. This study investigates to what extent implementers detect defects and to what extent defects cause different interpretations by different readers. We performed two controlled experiments with a large group of students (111) and a group of industrial practitioners (48). The experiment's results show that defects often remain undetected and cause misinterpretations. We present a classification of defect types based on a ranking of detection rate and risk for misinterpretation. Additionally we observed effects of using domain knowledge to compensate defects. The results are generalizable to industrial UML users and can be used for improving quality assurance techniques for UML-based development.", "authors": ["Christian F. J. Lange", "Michel R. V.

{"abstract": "This work focuses on developing optimal routing and camera control strategies for multiple mobile PTZ camera platforms cooperatively tracking a stochastic target moving on the ground. The vehicles are modeled as planar Dubins vehicles traveling at a fixed speed and height. The target is tracked using an Extended Kalman Consensus Filter that estimates the target location on the ground plane and the associated error covariance. Using dynamic programming, we compute optimal coordinated control policies which minimize the expected fused geolocation error covariance. The output of this process leads to the trajectories of the vehicles and the PTZ settings of the cameras. We show results on both ground and air vehicles tracking a target whose dynamics is modeled by a stochastic difference equation and discuss the implications of the results. The main contribution of the work is in the development of an optimal strategy for simultaneous vehicle navigation and camera parameter selection to maximize the tracking performance of stochastic targets where the risk of losing the target needs to be considered.", "authors": ["Chong Ding", "Akshay A.

{"abstract": "Estimating un-measurable states is an important component for onboard diagnostics (OBD) and control strategy development in diesel exhaust aftertreatment systems. This paper focuses on the development of an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) based state estimator for a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst (DOC) during active regeneration of a catalyzed particulate filter (CPF). The DOC estimator is critical to predict the exhaust gas states entering the downstream aftertreatment components such as a CPF and NO x  reduction catalysts such as urea-selective catalytic reduction (SCR) in heavy duty diesel vehicles. The internal states of the DOC that are important for the performance of the CPF and SCR systems include NO and NO 2  concentration states, that participate in the passive oxidation of particulate matter (PM) in the CPF and that are important for urea injection control system design in the SCR catalyst. During CPF active regeneration, the DOC is used to achieve a temperature exotherm by oxidizing the injected diesel fuel resulting in hydrocarbon slip into the CPF and an increased CPF inlet temperature (550-600\u00b0C) which promotes the PM oxidation. The results show that HC and temperature states in the DOC can be estimated using an EKF estimator with NOx and temperature measurements upstream of the DOC and temperature measurements downstream of the DOC.", "authors": ["Harsha Surenahalli", "Gordon G.

{"abstract": "Highly-configurable systems allow users to tailor the software to their specific needs. Not all combinations of configuration options are valid though, and constraints arise for technical or non-technical reasons. Explicitly describing these constraints in a variability model allows reasoning about the supported configurations. To automate creating variability models, we need to identify the origin of such configuration constraints. We propose an approach which uses build-time errors and a novel feature-effect heuristic to automatically extract configuration constraints from C code. We conduct an empirical study on four highly-configurable open-source systems with existing variability models having three objectives in mind: evaluate the accuracy of our approach, determine the recoverability of existing variability-model constraints using our analysis, and classify the sources of variability-model constraints.

{"abstract": "Nowadays, the software projects are buzz words in all walks of life. So the au-courant software projects are much complex than earlier projects. The strategic management of the developer organization cannot grasp the entire task of the project by mere software requirements specification and project input. To facilitate the current projects, the software developers use the project management activities proposed by project management institute US. This doesn't ossify completely the software development projects as scope of these activities limited to managerial activities. Even these managerial activities are not suitable for software project activities as these projects have notable differences with other types of projects. Some of the project activities are not suitable for software projects. These unsuitable activities are either to be modified or replaced by other activities to maintain the completeness of managerial activities.. In addition to managerial activities, for any project the project specific technical activities play key roles in shaping the project. The project specific technical activities cannot be generalized but however a methodology to identify technical activities is urgent need for today's software projects. This paper attempts to develop a methodology to abstract project specific technical activities from the project objectives and the input. In this proposed methodology, in addition to abstraction of technical activities, we have developed an implicit technique to identify scope of the literature survey and also provided with the option of optimizing the technical activities.", "authors": ["Shivanand M.

{"abstract": "The code written by a software developer is not always flawless. The more code is created the more errors are introduced into the system. In web development different programming languages can be used to implement back-end and front-end sides of the application. For example, it is possible to implement user input validation multiple times \u2014it validates the input values on client-side using JavaScript before the data is sent to server and then the received data is validated again on the server-side. The logic is duplicated, changes made to the validation code must be synchronised on both sides. All implementations must be also unit tested, which increases the time required to create and maintain multiple sets of unit tests. In this paper, we will describe how white-box testing tool Pex can be extended to generate user input validation code for ASP.NET MVC web applications. The validation code won't be duplicated in JavaScript on the client-side and the application will be protected from sending invalid input values from the client-side. The testers can focus on testing using meaningful data input values.

{"abstract": "This paper presents an extension of the traditional consensus problem to a formation control for a group of agents driven by second order dynamics. The communication between members of the group is assumed to be directed and affected by two rationally independent time delays, one in the position and the other in the velocity information channels. These delays are considered as constant and uniform throughout the communication topology. The stability of the consensus protocol is studied first, using a simplifying factorization procedure and deploying the Cluster Treatment of Characteristic Roots (CTCR) paradigm to obtain exact stability boundaries in the domain of the delays. CTCR requires the determination of all the potential stability switching loci in the domain of the delays. For this, a surrogate domain, called the \u201cSpectral Delay Space (SDS)\u201d is used. As the stability of the system is studied the findings yield a paradoxical control concept of \u201cDelay Scheduling\u201d. It shows that the stability of the system can be regained by increasing the delays. Once the stability of the consensus protocol is guaranteed, a new control term is added to obtain a desired stable formation for the agents.", "authors": ["Rudy Cepeda-Gomez", "Nejat Olgac"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["0bf829c3-d555-4745-b1a5-7c5ce8acbff6", "113efe85-9386-4899-8aa3-9fd3f1f30bc7", "1393e77c-5adc-42f7-9c75-6ed2d807f8a3", "223edc15-f2f7-4796-8b91-9fab63eda279", "2768199c-b9d6-4001-94d3-e6429c93bc5f", "432eb2bc-f842-465e-a6bd-144d80369fad", "49283113-801c-437b-86c6-2bcb94efafe9", "8c36c440-4f0b-4d26-9157-fa32eeb326f2", "d8587237-d8c7-4b4c-9ea9-681abee3de9d", "e648ea54-9506-40f8-919c-f8b0270449ca", "f2d1c7b0-8e6d-4d77-a0a0-b78143b7a3aa"], "title": "Formation control based on a consensus protocol under directed communications with two time delays", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "4e82a672-f639-4494-8c27-e5fb8f0bf743"}
{"abstract": "We consider the problem of synthesizing hierarchical controllers for discrete-time switched affine systems subject to exogenous disturbances that guarantee that the trajectories of the system satisfy a high-level specification expressed as a linear temporal logic formula. Our method builds upon recent results on temporal logic planning and embedded controller synthesis. First, the control problem is lifted to a discrete level by constructing a finite transition system that abstracts the behavior of the underlying switched system. At the discrete level, we recast the problem as a two player temporal logic game by treating the environment driven switches as adversaries. The solution strategy for the game (i.e. the discrete plan) is then implemented at the continuous level by solving finite-horizon optimal control problems that establish reachability between discrete states and that compensate the effects of continuous disturbances. We also extend the earlier work by making efficient use of propositions in the temporal logic formula to drive the abstraction procedure and to facilitate the computation of continuous input at implementation time. An aircraft fuel system example is formulated; and solved using the proposed method. This sample problem demonstrates the applicability of the abstraction procedure and correct-by-construction controllers to regulate the fuel levels in multiple tanks during interesting operations like aerial refueling.", "authors": ["Petter Nilsson", "Necmiye Ozay", "Ufuk Topcu", "Richard M.

{"abstract": "With the ever increasing demand for secure transactions in banking and also in mail delivery systems, encryption and decryption using cryptography plays a very important role. Nowadays, with 90% of secure transactions occurring on smart phones and other hand-held devices, a low on-chip area and a high speed algorithm to perform the same becomes the need for the day. In order to meet this requirement, several algorithms have been designed and implemented in the past, but each of these algorithms possess their own shortcomings with respect to an ASIC or an FPGA implementation. In this paper, we propose a novel and area efficient architecture for performing the mix columns & inverse mix columns operation, which is the major operation in the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) method of cryptography. We perform the same using ancient Vedic Mathematics techniques.

{"abstract": "This paper deals with the design of a decentralized fault diagnosis and prognosis methodology for interconnected nonlinear dynamical systems. For each subsystem, a local fault detector (LFD) is designed based on the measured local states of the subsystem alone. A fault is detected by using a local residual signal generated via the measured local subsystem states and the LFD estimates states. Each LFD consists of an adaptive online approximator to compensate the fault dynamics from local and non-local faults. Due to the interconnection nature of the large scale system, the non-local faults propagate to other subsystems and therefore are detected thus eliminating the need to measure and transmit the states of other subsystems. Fault detectability condition is also included for both local and non-local faults. Upon detection, faults local to the subsystem and to other subsystems are isolated. In addition, the proposed scheme provides the time to failure (or remaining useful life) information by using local measurements alone. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed decentralized fault diagnosis and prognosis scheme.", "authors": ["Hasan Ferdowsi", "Deepthi L.

{"abstract": "As the era of pervasive computing dawns, smart sensors and wireless sensor networks (WSN) are the main candidates to create a smart world where the things are able to interact to the Internet. This paper introduces a smart sensor monitoring system which is composed of a smartphone application, a data collection device, and smart sensors. Basically, the smart sensor monitoring system gets sensed data from smart sensors via the data collection device. To get sensed data, this paper proposes an enhanced fast sensor collection algorithm. Smart sensors in the proposed method learn their communication and collisions to adjust their schedule to gather sensor data from smart sensors, and find out suitable time to send sensor data. The proposed method also uses a wake-up signal to extend the lifetime of the smart sensor. In addition, this paper deals with the design and implementation of the smart sensor monitoring system, and the performance evaluation to verify the superiority of the proposed method.

{"abstract": "The estimation of project effort E and project duration D is based on several simple empirical rules (laws). The laws are almost independent although some dependencies must exist. An example is the existence of so called inaccessible area (IA). IA is the set of pairs (D, E) that cannot appear. IA is related to the changes of effort consumption dynamics (ECD) for tight project durations D. The widely used Rayleigh model RM of ECD does not imply the existence of IA and the behavior of project efforts for projects having (D,E) near their lA's. RM has further deficiencies. Let t max  be the time when effort intensity E(t) is maximal RM require that the effort E expended before t max  is near to 0.52E. Another drawback is that RM implies almost no effort consumption for t > 3.5t max . It therefore wrongly implies that zero defect software could be a feasible goal. It is known that it is not true. We propose a new model M inspired by physics having no such drawbacks. The model can be used to refine estimations of D and E after t max  is passed. The model implies several mutual dependencies of empirical laws of software development. M for example implies the behavior of effort E near inaccessibility area and implies a realistic estimation of project duration.", "authors": ["Jaroslav Kr\u00e1l", "M.

{"abstract": "Debugging and isolating changes responsible for regression test failures are some of the most challenging aspects of modern software development. Automatic bug localization techniques reduce the manual effort developers spend examining code, for example, by focusing attention on the minimal subset of recent changes that results in the test failure, or on changes to components with most dependencies or highest churn. We observe that another subset of changes is worth the developers' attention: the complement of the maximal set of changes that does not produce the failure. While for simple, independent source-code changes, existing techniques localize the failure cause to a small subset of those changes, we find that when changes interact, the failure cause is often in our proposed subset and not in the subset existing techniques identify. In studying 45 regression failures in a large, open-source project, we find that for 87% of those failures, the complement of the maximal passing set of changes is different from the minimal failing set of changes, and that for 78% of the failures, our technique identifies relevant changes ignored by existing work.

Normally customers have a preference for shopping in one firm or the other. A fixed percentage of them who encounter a stockout in the firm of their first choice, though, visits the other firm. This substitution behavior makes the firm's replenishment decisions strategically related. Our main contribution is to introduce a simple learning algorithm to inventory competition. The learning algorithm requires each firm (a) to have the knowledge of its own critical fractile, which the firm can calculate using the values of its own per unit revenue, order cost, and holding cost; and (b) to observe its own total demand realizations. They do not necessarily know their true demand distributions. The firms need not even have any information about each other, beyond the implicit information encoded in their own total demand realizations affected by their competitors' inventory decisions. In fact, the firms need not even be aware that they are engaged in inventory competition. We prove that the inventory decisions generated by the learning algorithm converge, with probability one, to certain threshold values that constitute an equilibrium in pure Markov strategies for an infinite-horizon discounted-reward inventory competition game.", "authors": ["Ashkan Zeinalzadeh", "Aydin Alptekinoglu", "Gurdal Arslan"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["0be58cc8-7bc7-4bed-a719-2219ff8b75db", "1ddf66bf-8aa7-4574-9afa-fea286812574", "57dc10f5-ed11-441c-9b67-74c088913941", "ac83d83c-99bc-4aeb-ab1d-7163c4698478", "cb11ce48-6927-4626-b0f0-b017e62a0019", "f767825a-61a2-488f-8725-7cabd5e1ae8f"], "title": "Learning in infinite-horizon inventory competition with total demand observations", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "4eef1b41-8727-4c49-876a-22f4d8be50eb"}

We mined the organizational, code complexity, code churn and pre-release bug metrics of that large scale software and built defect prediction models for each metric set. In the original study, organizational metrics were found to achieve the highest performance. In our case, models based on organizational metrics performed better than models based on churn metrics but were outperformed by pre-release metric models. Further, we verified four individual organisational metrics as indicators for defects.

Our framework is an instance of the intelligent cooperative control architecture (iCCA) where the learner incrementally improves on the output of a baseline planner through interaction and constrained exploration. We extend previous work by extracting the embedded parameterized transition model from within the cooperative planner and making it adaptable and accessible to all iCCA modules. We empirically demonstrate the advantage of using an adaptive model over a static model and pure learning approaches in an example GridWorld problem and a UAV mission planning scenario with 200 million possibilities.

{"abstract": "There are more than twenty distinct software engineering tasks addressed with text retrieval (TR) techniques, such as, traceability link recovery, feature location, refactoring, reuse, etc. A common issue with all TR applications is that the results of the retrieval depend largely on the quality of the query. When a query performs poorly, it has to be reformulated and this is a difficult task for someone who had trouble writing a good query in the first place.     We propose a recommender (called Refoqus) based on machine learning, which is trained with a sample of queries and relevant results. Then, for a given query, it automatically recommends a reformulation strategy that should improve its performance, based on the properties of the query. We evaluated Refoqus empirically against four baseline approaches that are used in natural language document retrieval. The data used for the evaluation corresponds to changes from five open source systems in Java and C++ and it is used in the context of TR-based concept location in source code. Refoqus outperformed the baselines and its recommendations lead to query performance improvement or preservation in 84% of the cases (in average).", "authors": ["Sonia Haiduc", "Gabriele Bavota", "Andrian Marcus", "Rocco Oliveto", "Andrea De Lucia", "Tim Menzies"], "n_citation": 99, "references": ["0d264cbf-06c2-4ce6-99d5-50a8f530059f", "0dbe042e-77df-4342-a9aa-059e92f984df", "0f4f2790-14a9-4524-8850-503aa094a6be", "28dc7c8d-7258-4bc5-ad19-71fc1d43070f", "30d4f0ad-89c2-4c3e-8330-295a5cc80502", "36769362-d5cc-438a-abf4-87912cc12166", "45719798-a753-4a2d-988d-ea7796439652", "4b768e94-c115-4baf-833e-f534e7d2226b", "5e9e8686-2bf0-48ae-bb4e-45827e7e58da", "7677c4d2-bb47-4ec9-b230-e447a73d7ddf", "866864a3-89b7-4c18-beae-8a9658ce50a7", "8db5bfda-8cdb-4bf6-8b67-f1eaf952ed85", "8ee9c6ef-03dc-44e7-9c71-ae98c1863151", "a0209215-82a9-4f97-a55b-aa1c41c55319", "a2f5888d-7f1c-4fe8-a28d-00a1ff5ff6a8", "a86e7279-8515-4ab7-9e00-15e507e065a8", "d01a5cbb-389b-4394-9a2d-0dcc4bad7fbf", "f010b74f-2043-49ce-ab21-31c29b81f433"], "title": "Automatic query reformulations for text retrieval in software engineering", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "4efca8a5-c08b-4146-8062-720d0f9fa663"}

{"abstract": "Cost, schedule and quality are highly correlated factors in software development. They basically form three sides of the same triangle. Beyond a certain point (the \"Quality is Free\" point), it is difficult to increase the quality without increasing either cost or schedule or both for the software under development. As products and applications mature, users expect higher quality products. They want IT organizations to be responsible and accountable for the quality claims made by the product marketing teams. In the last couple decades, much software engineering research has focussed on standards, methodologies and techniques for improving software quality, measuring software quality and software quality assurance. Most of this research is focused on the internal/development view of quality. More recent studies done in conjunction with the marketing groups have made attempts to understand the customer view of quality. All of these different ongoing activities to understand quality from the various perspectives have made the field even more enriching and exciting.

{"abstract": "Data-flow testing relies on static analysis for computing the definition-use pairs that serve as the test case requirements for a program. When testing large programs, the individual procedures are first tested in isolation during unit testing. Integration testing is performed to specifically test the procedure interfaces. The procedures in a program are integrated and tested in several steps. Since each integration step requires data-flow analysis to determine the new test requirements, the accumulated cost of repeatedly analyzing a program can contribute considerably to the overhead of testing. Data-flow analysis is typically computed using an exhaustive approach or by using incremental data-flow updates. This paper presents a new and more efficient approach to data-flow integration testing that is based on demand-driven analysis. We developed and implemented a demand-driven analyzer and experimentally compared its performance during integration testing with the performance of (i) a traditional exhaustive analyzer, and (ii) an incremental analyzer. Our experiments show that demand-driven analysis is faster than exhaustive analysis by up to a factor of 25. The demand-driven analyzer also outperforms the incremental analyzer in 80% of the test programs by up to a factor of 5.", "authors": ["Evelyn Duesterwald", "Rajiv Gupta", "Mary Lou Soffa"], "n_citation": 27, "references": ["01d50f91-0029-403d-a8ca-c9ed3754ddc2", "08a1b4eb-e543-437d-8346-f1b70b8dc493", "0a32ce9c-7b11-4194-b639-1cbf418734f5", "2ac5fedd-db52-4207-ac12-b527da60b604", "2c08d317-3848-40af-9dfa-20c8ce584ce9", "5297419d-c201-4a86-aada-bee5bae46e93", "57071747-069e-453f-b3e1-b16b417581ee", "7217d9cf-a377-40e0-b390-4cb2921f8748", "94443d41-2ba7-47d0-b84f-5e781485b3ff", "9479c8d3-fe5e-4988-9f4f-7acdc4209e75", "d011b04e-1b12-4caa-a0ae-2276931f095c", "f9fbe00e-2980-4c0e-a9b1-4e62fd5fa383", "fe6b6f13-daad-4752-b1ac-896820e912ee"], "title": "A demand-driven analyzer for data flow testing at the integration level", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 1996, "id": "4f3e67db-2d8b-4947-887f-ba4129255fb0"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, we investigate software architecture as a set of overlapping design rule spaces, formed by one or more structural or evolutionary relationships and clustered using our design rule hierarchy algorithm. Considering evolutionary coupling as a special type of relationship, we investigated (1) whether design rule spaces can reveal structural relations among error-prone files; (2) whether design rule spaces can reveal structural problems contributing to error-proneness.We studied three large-scale open source projects and found that error-prone files can be captured by just a few design rule sub-spaces. Supported by our tool, Titan, we are able to flexibly visualize design rule spaces formed by different types of relationships, including evolutionary dependencies. This way, we are not only able to visualize which error-prone files belong to which design rule spaces, but also to visualize the structural problems that give insight into why these files are error prone. Design rule spaces provide valuable direction on which parts of the architecture are problematic, and on why, when, and how to refactor.", "authors": ["Lu Xiao", "Yuanfang Cai", "Rick Kazman"], "n_citation": 32, "references": ["0c772631-fe96-4306-9c8b-4563c09a25c7", "11df7d57-bad8-4b0b-8ce8-e26c6d9eb2b0", "2068a31e-93c4-497f-ad79-c0ca3bf88ab8", "30e930a1-b9f5-4a60-8aef-0908c6f2b65c", "35283a30-6351-43a8-a84a-757018a94d5e", "5d9e6400-4f77-4bec-8a9e-7f2813022e49", "6ed2c2b2-4b3b-4529-8bb5-cb1369299801", "700bf1fb-326d-4409-b6ca-2c64f9aa09c0", "842e96df-fb8b-43ba-8643-4b3714b44dbf", "87cbb6d6-b0b5-4739-876a-f38081dce302", "abed179f-56b3-4cc6-975d-7177f879b97e", "b197cf6f-ca23-41f3-aa19-6a8047ab6875", "d2c0bb3b-27f9-4ba0-b5b3-d988a8ec8129", "d32786fc-ea8d-41f0-a803-5d00e550329c", "d5a44f14-60d8-4dd8-98a2-f805830df6cd", "dc9a7f74-01ef-4145-b060-dacdfc4d9613", "df5aea9c-6f0e-457b-8670-164be3423c98", "e14fb435-330b-45f2-9af7-bc8d68704907", "e5a2cb68-a00b-43ac-bf5f-b7c03292110d", "ee4be1e6-fb4a-4f94-b694-2b4774e97fda", "f2d01711-75b5-43c3-b298-f66d1cdaf117", "f5f3fb99-fad1-4bd7-bcde-a3b233bf2430"], "title": "Design rule spaces: a new form of architecture insight", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "4f6cbdea-d2ca-4bf2-8f07-97896fa98ccd"}

{"abstract": "While much progress has been achieved in task-space control of robot, existing task-space sensory feedback control methods fail when the sensor is out of working range. In this paper, we propose an adaptive regional feedback control strategy that enables the robot to start from an initial position outside the field of view and leave the field of view during the movement. The robot kinematics is partitioned into a known internal portion and an unknown external portion. Cartesian-space feedback is used for region reaching control of the known portion and vision feedback is used for tracking control of the unknown portion. The dual feedback information is integrated into a unified controller without designing multiple controllers and switching between them. We shall show that the adaptive controller can transit smoothly from Cartesian-space feedback to vision feedback in the presence of uncertainties in robot dynamics, kinematics and depth information. Experimental results are presented to illustrate the performance of the proposed control method.", "authors": ["X. F.

The objective is to find a transformed digital picture of a given picture such that the sum of absolute errors between the gray level histogram of the transformed picture and that of a reference picture is minimized. This is equivalent to placing  k 1 linearly ordered objects of different sizes one by one into  k 2 linearly ordered boxes of assorted sizes, such that the accumulated error of space underpacked or overpacked in the boxes is minimized; the placement function is monotonic, which ensures a polynomial time solution to this problem.

Ant colony optimization (ACO) is a rapidly evolving meta-heuristic technique based on the real life behavior of ants and can be used to solve NP-Hard (SDPSP) problem. Different versions of ACO meta-heuristic have already been applied to the software project scheduling problem in the past that took various resources into account. We have applied elitist strategy of ACO (elitist ant system) for solving SDPSP in a parameter-constrained environment taking project's cost and duration into consideration.

It is argued that such a hierarchy should consist of models spanning a wide range of accuracy and cost in order to be a cost-effective tool in the design of computer systems. Judicious use of the hierarchy can satisfy the conflicting needs of high accuracy and low cost of performance evaluation. A system design procedure that uses the hierarchy is developed.  The concepts developed are illustrated by applying them to a case study of system design. The results of optimizations conducted using a two-level performance model hierarchy and a simple cost model are discussed. In almost all the experiments conducted, the optimization procedure converged to a region very close to a locally optimum system.

{"abstract": "Java 8 introduces two functional features: lambda expressions and functional operations like map or filter that apply a lambda expression over the elements of a Collection. Refactoring existing code to use these new features enables explicit but unobtrusive parallelism and makes the code more succinct. However, refactoring is tedious (it requires changing many lines of code) and error-prone (the programmer must reason about the control-flow, data-flow, and side-effects). Fortunately, these refactorings can be automated. We present LambdaFicator, a tool which automates two refactorings. The first refactoring converts anonymous inner classes to lambda expressions. The second refactoring converts for loops that iterate over Collections to functional operations that use lambda expressions. In 9 open-source projects we have applied these two refactorings 1263 and 1595 times, respectively. The results show that LambdaFicator is useful.

{"abstract": "This paper deals with the robust boundary stabilization problem of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) subject to boundary uncertainties. These systems include a second-order undamped wave equation and a first-order delay system. By taking the integral transformation, we obtain a nominal PDE with asymptotic stability in the new coordinates when an appropriate boundary control input is applied. The associated Lyapunov function can then be used for designing an infinite-dimensional sliding surface, on which the system exhibits exponential stability, invariant of the bounded matched disturbance. A continuous sliding-mode boundary control law satisfied with reaching condition is employed to ensure the system's will reach the proposed sliding surface within finite time.

{"abstract": "The dangling else problem consists of a class of potential ambiguities in ALGOL-like conditional statements whose basic form is \u201cif  B 1 then if  B 2 then  S 1 else  S 2\u201d where  B 1 and  B 2 are Boolean expressions and  S 1 and  S 2 are basic statements. The difficulty lies in whether to attach the else to the first if or to the second one. Existing solutions to the problem are either ambiguous or unnecessarily restrictive. Let  S  and  S 1 be statements. We define  S  to be  closed  if \u201c S  else  S 1\u201d is not a statement, and to be  open  if \u201c S  else  S 1\u201d is a statement. Thus an unconditional statement is a closed statement. Open and closed conditional statements are defined by syntax equations in such a way as to preserve openness and closure. In each case, an else must always be preceded by a closed statement. It is shown that the syntax equations are unambiguous, and that any change in the statement types required within the syntax equations would lead to either ambiguity or unnecessary restriction.", "authors": ["Paul W.

{"abstract": "At the beginning of a change task, software developers search the source code to locate the places relevant to the task. As previous research and a small exploratory study that we conducted show, developers perform poorly in identifying good search terms and therefore waste a lot of time querying and exploring irrelevant code. To support developers in this step, we present an approach to automatically identify good search terms. Based on existing work and an analysis of change tasks, we derived heuristics, determined their relevancy and used the results to develop our approach. For a preliminary evaluation, we conducted a study with ten developers working on open source change tasks. Our approach was able to identify good search terms for all tasks and outperformed the searches of the participants, illustrating the potential of our approach. In addition, since the used heuristics are solely based on textual features of change tasks, our approach is easy and generally applicable and can leverage much of the existing work on feature location.", "authors": ["Katja Kevic", "Thomas Fritz"], "n_citation": 10, "references": ["0dbe042e-77df-4342-a9aa-059e92f984df", "30d4f0ad-89c2-4c3e-8330-295a5cc80502", "36769362-d5cc-438a-abf4-87912cc12166", "4c47c288-93d2-4a81-9f3c-810bf5c4417b", "4cadad1c-4d28-498d-8527-03cd19628bfd", "4efca8a5-c08b-4146-8062-720d0f9fa663", "55af394f-7266-49b7-ae21-4dec24f3ac11", "5e9e8686-2bf0-48ae-bb4e-45827e7e58da", "732d4b82-2074-4547-947f-eebcd1c1030c", "7677c4d2-bb47-4ec9-b230-e447a73d7ddf", "866864a3-89b7-4c18-beae-8a9658ce50a7", "8ee9c6ef-03dc-44e7-9c71-ae98c1863151", "a86e7279-8515-4ab7-9e00-15e507e065a8", "bc3eee18-dec3-47c8-8908-d9dc1e1197ee", "d65d7e8b-7f8e-4428-a166-725e57ca0e47", "d745be53-fd55-4020-8af4-94a3dddd9390", "f1943e3e-cfed-40e2-9683-829fc8bb5036"], "title": "Automatic search term identification for change tasks", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "501ebd0e-5863-48b3-a833-ec1228d11fa4"}

Targeted at developing a real-time hybrid energy management strategy, a stochastic dynamic programming \u2014 extremum seeking (SDP-ES) optimization algorithm with both the system states and output feedback is investigated in this paper. This SDP-ES algorithm utilizes a state-feedback control, which is offline generated by the stochastic dynamic programming (SDP), as a reference term to ensure the approximate global energy optimality and battery state-of-charge (SOC) sustainability. And in real-time, this algorithm injects a \u201clocal\u201d feedback term via extremum seeking (ES), which is a non-model-based nonlinear optimization method, to compensate the control commands from the SDP and generate more fuel-efficient operation points along the specific SOC sustaining line, by leveraging the real-time measurement of system outputs (fuel consumption and emissions).

{"abstract": "In this paper we provide stabilization criteria for a class of nonlinear systems with time-varying state and input delays. The nonlinear system is assumed to be separable into a nominal linear part and an additive nonlinear perturbation satisfying the linear growth constraint. The time-varying delays as well as their time derivatives are assumed to be bounded above. A linear state-feedback controller is chosen to close the control loop. The validation of this approach is carried out through two simulation examples. The first example uses a theoretical model with all the conditions established in our main result. The second simulation consists of an attitude control problem using Modified Rodrigues Parameters.", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9-Marcio Luna", "Chaouki T. Abdallah", "R.

{"abstract": "Developers often inspect a diff patch during peer code reviews. Diff patches show low-level program differences per file without summarizing  systematic changes ---similar, related changes to multiple contexts. We present C ritics , an interactive approach for inspecting systematic changes. When a developer specifies code change within a diff patch, C ritics  allows developers to customize the change template by iteratively generalizing change content and context. By matching a generalized template against the codebase, it summarizes similar changes and detects potential mistakes. We evaluated C ritics  using two methods. First, we conducted a user study at Salesforce.com, where professional engineers used C ritics  to investigate diff patches authored by their own team. After using C ritics , all six participants indicated that they would like C ritics  to be integrated into their current code review environment. This also attests to the fact that C ritics  scales to an industry-scale project and can be easily adopted by professional engineers. Second, we conducted a user study where twelve participants reviewed diff patches using C ritics  and Eclipse diff. The results show that human subjects using C ritics  answer questions about systematic changes 47.3% more correctly with 31.9% saving in time during code review tasks, in comparison to the baseline use of Eclipse diff. These results show that C ritics  should improve developer productivity in inspecting systematic changes during peer code reviews.", "authors": ["Tianyi Zhang", "Myoungkyu Song", "Joseph Pinedo", "Miryung Kim"], "n_citation": 21, "references": ["14790cc8-c733-4192-addd-5935254485f7", "184db203-e41b-4e0c-91fc-af9b6c9e4c82", "18fcee90-9582-4e29-b6de-e2c21d3b5166", "1dff0894-ca58-42de-bad8-955da57632d3", "29ecc9ea-5384-4335-96cd-5a355b4acbfa", "2abd64bc-cf45-4d3a-ae4f-034242346c09", "3010131d-75fd-42d3-8ed2-9afb4f6cfedd", "33918580-b0ea-4065-992b-d40d833a4eaa", "34de069c-f9eb-46b3-a34b-3e9dcd4867ad", "367f9960-f1a4-44f6-aab5-5ccfef086b8d", "3de9c3b9-d8c4-4258-99f3-71bba1590f30", "4e4ad688-fbd5-404c-855e-73fd71bbc8d7", "566d5ab3-e1d3-4228-a4e0-b8e449c42937", "5cea9eb2-f023-4c43-bae9-cc5d785146f8", "6c4d9588-c36a-454d-bcc0-6832b0121751", "6e49d933-809f-4253-a126-90e08a2d5d3f", "6ec51ecc-8a9f-4c98-8db9-03f21d344455", "7eb9832b-5093-4e29-baa0-a50e825bd24f", "819da3e8-bebd-4a36-8991-b51fb011ae43", "87caaeaa-9ea0-4d79-8546-01e5d4829e6d", "8de8d977-213c-4800-9e5e-a5259f7bcbc5", "9011a9b2-7e79-43c5-9e63-be634e4fd9e2", "922494b7-4ffa-4896-a48d-711c955bad93", "98f6d19d-fdf0-48e3-b600-05fbc3023ea3", "a4554a50-f14a-4bd1-926a-7d7dceef361c", "a6a20a08-ad61-460b-8a9f-18539e04a1e7", "ae81960e-eff9-4729-b676-c9ad02f9cff7", "b1c3e7ff-82df-49a4-a64f-28ae8aae34ee", "b394491a-d4e2-4994-bef6-f2217c05db9a", "b984854e-bcba-44c4-938b-95e12b82b31f", "c0183ac9-2586-40b4-ad76-cb577472e3b1", "d087be51-9e03-417a-b495-aaea1f831e66", "d8d88861-2c84-4d3e-bcd5-6236e455169d", "ddf973e6-0f30-4de8-b756-24de96f3e55f", "e28446eb-7527-43ef-88f3-5a870f8aee29", "e5312ed1-0a24-4294-a6b6-e173722f8beb", "e5a2d1cc-33d1-4530-8d68-6a6ad7a90c7b", "f2c28fe3-bc62-4d0c-b717-c590b3862778", "f5631c62-f8c4-45bb-a227-9462a18e13e4", "f907d596-64da-41ca-a8e6-556c4f48175a", "fdcf4dd4-73d7-4399-8d3c-c2c24c3fb4eb"], "title": "Interactive code review for systematic changes", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "509bd8aa-e52f-4354-b0b4-e405674aecfb"}

{"abstract": "Software Engineering in general is a very creative process, especially in the early stages of development like requirements engineering or architectural design where sketching techniques are used to manifest ideas and share thoughts. On the one hand, a lot of diagram tools with sophisticated editing features exist, aiming to support the engineers for this task. On the other hand, research has shown that most formal tools limit designer's creativity by restricting input to valid data. This raises the need for combining the flexibility of sketch-based input with the power of formal tools. With an increasing amount of available touch-enabled input devices, plenty of tools supporting these and similar features were created but either they require the developer to use a special diagram editor generation framework or have very limited extension capabilities. In this paper we propose Scribble: A generic, extensible framework which brings sketching functionality to any new or existing GEF based diagram editor in the Eclipse ecosystem.

{"abstract": "Engineers of large systems must be concerned with both design of new systems and maintenance of existing systems. A great deal of effort goes into arranging things so that systems may be maintained and extended when needed, and that new systems fit into the context of existing structures. Insight about the support of software engineering can thus be derived by examining how other branches of engineering support their version of the processes of engineering.  Before embarking on a design project an engineer must first determine the customer's need. This is always a complex process, involving modeling of the customer's situation, to determine exactly what is essential and what is accidental. The specifications derived from this analysis are the input to the design process. The specifications may be expressed in varying degrees of formality. Though mathematical formalism is to be desired because it is unambiguous and because it can be manipulated precisely, existing mathematical technique is usually inadequate to precisely specify the requirements. This means that the specification phase must be part of the debugging loop.  The design engineer first attempts to meet the specifications with some existing artifact. If this fails, he attempts to synthesize an artifact that meets the specifications by combining the behaviors of several parts, according to some standard plan. For example, in electrical engineering, a complex signal-processing system can often be composed as a cascade of simpler signal-processing components - an engineer knows that the transfer function of a cascade is the product of the transfer functions of the parts cascaded, if the loading is correct. Such design depends on the ability to compute the behavior of a combination of parts from their specifications and a description of how they are combined. Often such analysis must be approximate, with bugs worked out by simulation and debugging of breadboard prototypes.  This design strategy is greatly enhanced by the existence of compatible families of canned parts with agreed-upon interfaces and well-defined specifications. If the family of canned parts is sufficiently universal, the interfaces sufficiently well specified, and if design rules can be formulated to isolate the designer from the details of the implementation of the parts, the family constitutes a design language. For example, TTL is a pretty good design language for relatively slow digital systems. Just as the approximations of analysis are often imperfect, the abstraction barriers of the design language are often violated, for good reasons. Thus there are the inevitable bugs. These may be found in simulation or prototyping.  One key observation is that all phases of engineering involve bugs and debugging. Bugs are not evidence of moral turpitude or inadequate preparation on the part of the engineer, they are an essential aspect of effective strategy in the problem-solving process. Real-world problems are usually too complex to specify precisely, even assuming that we have adequate formal language to support such specifications. (Imagine trying to formalize what is meant by \u201cMy program plays chess at the Expert level.\u201d or \u201cMy music synthesizer circuit makes sounds that are like a fine violin.\u201d in any precise way, yet surely such specifications are the meat of real engineering.) And even where one can write very precise specifications (as in \u201cThis circuit makes 1/f noise.\u201d) such specifications are often mathematically intractable in current practice. Even worse, analysis of systems made up of a few simple, precisely-specifiable components such as transistors (here a few exponential equations suffice), or floating-point additions are mathematically intractable. Thus engineers, like physicists, make progress by approximate reasoning. Linearizations are made, and deductions that ignore possibly important interactions are used to plan designs, with the explicit intention of finding the relevant ignored effects in the simulation or prototype debugging phase of design. Bugs thus arise from the deliberate oversimplification of problems inherent in using perturbational methods to develop answers to hard problems. Finally, bugs often arise, in apparently finished products, because of unanticipated changes in the requirements of the customer. Although these are technically not errors in the design, the methods we have for patching a design to accommodate a change in requirements amounts to debugging the installed system.  Software engineering needs appropriate tools to support each of the phases of the engineering process. There must be tools to aid with specification and modelling, with synthesis and analysis, with rapid-prototyping and debugging, with documentation, verification, and testing, and with maintenance of finished products. In addition there must be environmental tools to support the engineering process in the large.  Our tools must support the natural processes of problem solving. They must provide precise ways to talk about alternate design plans and strategies. There is no doubt that mathematical formalisms, such as logic and abstract algebra are essential ingredients in such an enterprise, but we must be careful to separate our concerns. Mathematical formalisms and technique are rarely strong enough to provide better than very approximate models of interesting physical, economic or engineered systems. Sometimes a system that is readily described as a computer program is not easily formalized in more conventional terms. This suggests the exciting possibility that some difficult theoretical constructs can be formally represented as computational algorithms. We can expect to manipulate these as we now manipulate equations of classical analysis. Such a paradigm shift is already taking place in control theory. Twenty years ago, the dominant method for making control systems was synthesizing them using feedback, and the dominant theory was concerned with the stability of linear feedback systems. In contrast, most modern control systems are microprocessor-based, and the theory is now much more qualitative. Moreover, the program for the microprocessor is often a much simpler description of the strategy of control than the classical equations, and one can thus express much more complex strategies than were previously feasible to analyze and synthesize. An even more striking revolution has occurred in the design of signal-processing systems. The nature of the field has changed completely, because digital filters are algorithms.  Artificial intelligence research often uses programs as theoretical constructs, akin to equations and schematic diagrams, but with the added feature that programs that embody parts of a theory of the design of programs can be used as tools in the process of theory construction (or software development). The language Lisp, for example, was initially conceived as a theoretical vehicle recursion theory and for symbolic algebra. Most AI experiments are formulated in Lisp. Lisp has developed into a uniquely powerful and flexible family of software development tools, providing wrap-around support for the rapid-prototyping of software systems. As with other languages, Lisp provides the glue for using a vast library of canned parts, produced by members of the AI community. In Lisp, procedures are first-class data, to be passed as arguments, returned as values, and stored in data structures. This flexibility is valuable, but most importantly, it provides mechanisms for formalizing, naming, and saving the idioms - the common patterns of usage that are essential to engineering design. In addition, Lisp programs can easily manipulate the representations of Lisp programs - a feature that has encouraged the development of a vast structure of program synthesis and analysis tools, such as cross-referencers.", "authors": ["Gerald Jay Sussman"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["609be54b-ddd0-43b4-b78e-71ec32ec0d15", "7ce7cc32-7d1e-47ca-b57b-ba01ab467141", "c9d6747e-dcfc-4b37-8dfa-52ccb9e8ddee"], "title": "Intelligent support for the engineering of software (panel paper)", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 1985, "id": "50c22915-5971-44fc-b46a-348c3501b861"}

{"abstract": "One often encounters the curse of dimensionality in the application of dynamic programming to determine optimal policies for controlled Markov chains. In this paper, we provide a method to construct sub-optimal policies along with a bound for the deviation of such a policy from the optimum via a linear programming approach. The state-space is partitioned and the optimal cost-to-go or value function is approximated by a constant over each partition. By minimizing a positive cost function defined on the partitions, one can construct an approximate value function which also happens to be an upper bound for the optimal value function of the original Markov Decision Process (MDP). As a key result, we show that this approximate value function is independent of the positive cost function (or state dependent weights; as it is referred to, in the literature) and moreover, this is the least upper bound that one can obtain; once the partitions are specified. We apply the linear programming approach to a perimeter surveillance stochastic optimal control problem; whose structure enables efficient computation of the upper bound.", "authors": ["Kalyanam Krishnamoorthy", "Myoungkuk Park", "Swaroop Darbha", "Meir Pachter", "Phillip R.

{"abstract": "The traditional mechanism for maintaining a list of pending events in a discrete event simulation is the simple linked list. However, in large scale simulations this list often becomes cumbersome to maintain since the number of pending events may become quite large. As a result, the execution time required by the simple linked list is often a significant portion of total simulation time. Several papers have been published suggesting improved synchronization procedures. The most efficient procedures reported are the time-indexed procedure and the two-level procedure. Both methodologies are much more efficient than simple linked lists; however, neither has been adopted by a general purpose simulation language. Further, both procedures require external parameter definition, which is a major handicap to their adoption by a general purpose language. This paper introduces a new sychronization procedure, the two-list procedure, which is much faster than simple linked lists for large pending event files. This procedure was designed for implementation in Fortran, and properly implemented it is transparent to the user. Thus it is ideal for adoption by general purpose simulation languages.", "authors": ["John H. Blackstone", "Gary L. Hogg", "Don T.

Table 1 shows such a frequency table. Next, the total weighted execution time for a given operation type is obtained by multiplying the time required for the operation by the frequency count. Finally, an \u201caverage\u201d operation time is calculated by summing overall operation types and dividing by the sum of the frequency counts. Table 2 shows the computation for the IBM 7090.

{"abstract": "Many interesting questions about the software quality of a code base can only be answered adequately if fine-grained information about the evolution of quality metrics over time and the contributions of individual developers is known. We present an approach for tracking static analysis violations (which are often indicative of defects) over the revision history of a program, and for precisely attributing the introduction and elimination of these violations to individual developers. As one application, we demonstrate how this information can be used to compute ``fingerprints'' of developers that reflect which kinds of violations they tend to introduce or to fix. We have performed an experimental study on several large open-source projects written in different languages, providing evidence that these fingerprints are well-defined and capture characteristic information about the coding habits of individual developers.", "authors": ["Pavel Avgustinov", "Arthur I.

{"abstract": "Passive systems theory is used to develop a general procedure to design the control structure of chemical process networks. A natural storage function, derived from the second law of thermodynamics, is the basis for passivity-based control design. The inventory control laws are implemented locally and individual units become passive. With all units in a chemical processing plant designed to be locally passive, the entire network will be passive and retain desirable properties such as L 2  input-output stability and Lyapunov stability. The procedure presented allows for the decomposition of large flowsheets and the design of passivity-based control laws with little process information. The minimum number of controlled inventories to assure passivity of the entire network is identified. Additional degrees of freedom are available for constraint handling, flow control and determining the process load. The chemical looping combustion process is used as an illustrative example for the procedure.", "authors": ["Timothy McFarland", "B.

{"abstract": "Software traceability is a sought-after, yet often elusive quality in software-intensive systems. Required in safety-critical systems by many certifying bodies, such as the USA Federal Aviation Authority, software traceability is an essential element of the software development process. In practice, traceability is often conducted in an ad-hoc, after-the-fact manner and, therefore, its benefits are not always fully realized. Over the past decade, researchers have focused on specific areas of the traceability problem, developing more sophisticated tooling, promoting strategic planning, applying information retrieval techniques capable of semi-automating the trace creation and maintenance process, developing new trace query languages and visualization techniques that use trace links, and applying traceability in specific domains such as Model Driven Development, product line systems, and agile project environments. In this paper, we build upon a prior body of work to highlight the state-of-the-art in software traceability, and to present compelling areas of research that need to be addressed.", "authors": ["Jane Cleland-Huang", "Orlena Gotel", "Jane Huffman Hayes", "Patrick M\u00e4der", "Andrea Zisman"], "n_citation": 137, "references": ["00c6259d-8c77-4da4-8516-71cee3b23ffe", "015144cf-6836-40be-9bb6-741211a00d4b", "050ad4c6-8428-4406-9634-520887fe32e6", "07f1cf97-db7d-4fbb-910b-33394ae9b5ec", "11b13e3d-2b2c-4013-be44-8041b7a47e84", "13eddc70-8569-47bb-9c41-5dc41945a60d", "1612f943-8cfa-49ca-ac16-0449d5a4f257", "183eb84b-3be6-4faa-8f74-91b85ecfbfd7", "19c9b32f-3df9-43f2-891b-43b77ec751a3", "1b1105d4-48de-4f0e-879d-de7de73d3a5f", "1e188607-ec89-4d1a-874c-f27b3aaa0837", "20da9d09-2a44-4744-b5dd-2d559d2827bd", "2702ff8f-3e12-4cf8-82b9-2ecd3958f7ab", "298f0ede-7f47-402d-b078-b0f0c7625d21", "29bb062c-a61b-4a58-bce5-04795cfb6538", "32c488d4-9853-4629-8fd5-e0adc818b57a", "35f98658-bea9-4710-bf32-5de39398b780", "3a1a81b8-e1eb-4870-9af3-8653b3dc57a2", "43029b0e-e2d7-4c5b-898c-c553fdfc4a9c", "4b768e94-c115-4baf-833e-f534e7d2226b", "523c08c4-1e56-4085-95a2-007872e1f6de", "58ed955b-d04c-405c-9f2c-3fd2482165e3", "5a17d651-1cdd-430e-8ff5-233dc3541aae", "5c02ccdd-0641-4707-8a8f-9b067a88155f", "5c5025e9-996e-40c2-9602-00cf423db798", "5d349450-5485-4c95-a190-772cf30abd06", "621cbb55-0b62-42b3-9fae-1bec1c3be7aa", "6428af08-ad04-410b-8c5b-b4f3de7ed6bd", "65acba26-3449-48c8-ac84-83465430d11b", "6e198e5e-9655-418f-9abe-f2507c87ad91", "774567c6-eaeb-44d2-9e87-a11e396ae75f", "7aea3c82-235c-4a72-8907-463be14775e2", "7b9d51c6-6273-4a2c-a065-2e0f8bbdf24a", "7dbaa5e3-edaa-4486-8c3c-ed5f98272dc9", "86707dbb-947d-40fa-b215-0bd8bb306cb0", "86be8394-6eb1-4a0f-bd20-630ee358e337", "8cb074f5-26bf-45fd-97f9-c1b7b3844fa3", "8e34b9ea-e947-41f3-a097-5964b058bdc8", "951a3c0b-0588-45db-9ea9-f7d038f5eaa3", "98789de8-55ab-4e29-a27a-3641f1b7586d", "998190b2-61b5-4a6d-90b4-6b8376cfe42c", "a2589cd6-3ba0-4525-bf03-b875d6f9d905", "a9a799ad-4dce-4b03-b9c7-b8a1bf8e3e10", "aad8c011-876f-4703-acce-76f5c1184dc7", "aff93bf2-d26d-4c55-8ae2-706271f3adf8", "b08cb52f-8480-418a-8b83-ac8004cd508b", "b27e02ea-4d01-4f1a-a491-8babd856eaae", "b4cac501-1d54-49d4-938b-74fe93fd615d", "b75e3ba9-9011-47be-b83f-d5756845cd7d", "bc807ce4-f4e3-4042-a24c-9d6820ebd632", "bcb72159-6b75-4dfc-8692-0d503628d19f", "c33e72d6-34cb-438b-a3b8-2de19e262102", "c88fdf44-3a31-4989-8639-b66255fe19f5", "d3a1f4be-187b-4780-9cf1-7fe130a0b11b", "d3a35086-9f04-4d56-8224-758494557d85", "d412b66f-1c75-4624-b3f1-fbff569d1f50", "d48441ef-3c7e-40dd-bf14-458c84b21ab9", "d52cb6dd-1d63-4a44-9941-8958dc435445", "da7fe6b8-1aad-4b6e-b484-e59201f01b18", "dd0a59cd-4357-41f2-986d-5b02666d32e5", "ec4bf8a4-f695-46a6-b12d-d0e612eeaa6e", "ec52f013-905e-4b52-9f63-8a2700eb632d", "ecdddb4b-400c-4764-ae0a-80b2d7a1554c", "ed90f2db-0062-48a2-bb00-aa1a959f0ef6", "ee211035-6a18-4023-a7b1-8103ba5ae8fd", "f11154bf-aacb-45c8-a265-8a3030b570fe", "f7a1cb00-7071-4952-8516-e6cb2c78366f", "fae1c998-e75c-41b4-b612-5135f92e0803", "fbd55ac7-b7af-455c-a366-1b16d0daa909"], "title": "Software traceability: trends and future directions", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "518cebc4-9d47-4cf9-8a15-851fd27da93b"}
{"abstract": "Software as a Service (SaaS) is now recognized as an effective model for the development, deployment, and customization of software. It has been reported that it reduces the costs as well as ensures the long-term sustainability of software systems. Monolithic software systems are seen as a set of interrelated and geographically distributed services over the Internet. Developers and providers can easily customize services while being able to accommodate a large range of stakeholders. At the core of this service orientation of the whole field of software development are the Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) design principles. These principles detail what we should do, but not how and by whom it has to be done. From a human perspective -- all stakeholders -- we argue that the current SOA design principles can be linked and benefit from the user experience/user-centric design. Such combination can lead to a user experience-centric and SOA-based design approach that guarantees that SaaS is secure, yet trustable, useful, usable and accessible. In this position paper, we reviewed SOA/SaaS from the human dimension with the goal to bridging the gaps between SOA design principles and the User Experience (UX) design communities including Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and service design. One practical goal is to enhance the SOA, as a technological platform with elements of UX including the social aspects of their interactions within the organizational structure and processes.", "authors": ["Victoria Karaseva", "Ahmed Seffah"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["11a1414c-2890-42f5-bec5-be7b0991e115", "1f9d0f44-0636-46e7-ada4-c263df1f5a69", "3bc34af7-ab06-4271-9a7a-052a45b42bf5", "8ebf1eea-34ab-4443-9ecd-78c34d7230cc", "c9a5e925-03b1-4fd4-929b-01c4f916040a", "de710137-fbd1-4437-966e-9d2cc752d4c9", "fa3b225e-78a3-40ee-ab00-4f5df6f4d52d"], "title": "The human side of software as a service: building a tighter fit between human experiences and SOA design practices", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "518d21d3-d131-470f-8fe5-d5ab5d8aa10b"}

{"abstract": "Clustering techniques are the unsupervised data mining applications and are important in data mining methods for exploring natural structure and identifying interesting patterns in original data, also it is proved to be helpful in finding coexpressed samples. In cluster analysis, generally the given dataset is partitioned into groups based on the given features such that the data objects in the same group are more similar to each other than the data objects in other groups. The objects are clustered or grouped based on the principle of maximizing intra-class similarity and minimizing interclass similarity. In this paper, the rough set theory (RST) has been used for attribute clustering. RST is a theory adopted to deal with rough and unsure knowledge, which analyzes the clusters and finds the data principles when previous knowledge is not available, providing a new method for data classification. With the continuous change in data objects we have to improve these relevant technologies over time, and we have to propose creative theory in response, meeting the demands of application, though there are many rough set methods. In this paper; after implementing the rough set based attribute clustering method on real life leukemia dataset, we classify them using some of the traditional classification techniques such as Multilayered Perceptron (MLP) based classifier, Naive Bayesian (NB) classifier and Support Vector Machine (SVM). At the end, the same classification techniques are applied to classify the original leukemia dataset before application of rough set based attribute clustering. Finally the paper provides a comparative analysis among the traditional classifiers and the proposed corresponding rough set based classifiers. Among all, the proposed MLP classifier is found to be the better classifier than the others giving higher classification accuracy and it is proved to be efficient having lower error ratio.", "authors": ["Rudra Kalyan Nayak", "Debahuti Mishra", "Satyabrata Das", "Kailash Shaw", "S.R.

{"abstract": "Diesel oxidation catalysts (DOCs) have become standard components in Diesel engine aftertreatment systems to reduce carbon monoxide (CO) and unburned hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Intensive studies have been focused on improving the performance of DOCs which has been found to be influenced significantly by its thermal behaviors. The objective of this research is to develop a control-oriented thermal model for a DOC in a DOC/DPF integrated aftertreatment system for real-time control purposes. The control-oriented model is established by considering both the thermal inertia and chemical reactions inside it. The engine-out and DOC-out emissions have been analyzed before simplified empirical models were proposed for the prediction of cared emissions. Experimental validation results show that the control-oriented model is capable of capturing both the gas phase and the solid phase thermal dynamics of a DOC. The control-oriented modeling of the thermal behaviors will be beneficial in integrated engine and aftertreatment system controls.", "authors": ["Pingen Chen", "Junmin Wang"], "n_citation": 50, "references": [], "title": "Control-oriented modeling of thermal behaviors for a Diesel oxidation catalyst", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "51ad9b06-7393-48a1-91f5-992573913a7f"}

{"abstract": "Complex distributed environments contain thousands of workstations that can run hundreds of applications. Multiple networks are used to connect the workstations to dozens of behind-the-scenes servers, all of which are necessary for the user to perform even simple tasks. Such distributed environments are difficult to design and maintain, and current software engineering practices are not well adapted to deal with this inherent complexity. This paper describes the Single Glass Project in the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group. Single Glass expands the number of both internally developed and commercial-off-the-shelf applications a single user can access from any workstation. The result is in production use by over 6,000 people in both Puget Sound and Wichita. The key to success is a flexible and scaleable architecture that works within a complex, heterogeneous application and delivery system environment. Our work has focused on both computing technology (software and delivery systems) and general processes (primary technology, support, and organization). Agreements on both technology and process improvements are essential to project success. Single Glass is a work in progress, and we describe areas that require additional investigation. Our experience indicates that most technical problems can be addressed. However, significant improvement is needed in software engineering processes and practices to design and build applications and systems that can be tested, delivered, supported, and diagnosed when made available alongside other, independently developed applications and systems.", "authors": ["David J.

{"abstract": "Refactorings are behaviour-preserving program transformations, typically for improving the structure of existing code. A few of these transformations have been mechanised in interactive development environments. Many more refactorings have been proposed, and it would be desirable for programmers to script their own refactorings. Implementing such source-to-source transformations, however, is quite complex: even the most sophisticated development environments contain significant bugs in their refactoring tools.We present a domain-specific language for refactoring, named JunGL. It manipulates a graph representation of the program: all information about the program, including ASTs for its compilation units, variable binding, control flow and so on is represented in a uniform graph format.

To do that, as in our previous work [1], we use a vision-based approach to estimate the state of the flow. Since visual measurements are used, we propose to exploit visual servoing techniques to derive an efficient control law. Therefore, contrary to the literature concerning drag reduction, we also simultaneously minimize the kinetic energy density of the flow. That is of great importance since the controlled flow may become turbulent when this kinetic energy density is growing. To cope with this problem we propose to design a control law based on partitioned visual servo control. This approach has been first proposed in the robotics community by [2]. Simulations results validate our control scheme.

{"abstract": "Interest in the use of processes to provide assistance in software development activities remains at a high level. But the focus of attention has shifted in recent years. Early work emphasizing the study of languages for defining processes was rapidly eclipsed by process evaluation and improvement work, most notably the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). As process improvement has matured as a strategy and philosophy it has also given rise to a strong reaction to the perception that it is unduly ponderous and constraining. Movements such as Extreme Programming (XP) have cast themselves as lightweight alternatives, emphasizing the primacy of freedom and flexibility. Both philosophies and communities continue to grow in size, development, and depth of understanding.The goal of this panel will be to explore the differences between these major approaches to the use of process in software development by bringing together leading articulate exponents of the approaches. Each panelist will be charged with presenting a very concise characterization of the approach being represented. But the focus of the panel will be on understanding the nature of the differences in approach, and the reasons for these differences. Similarities will be sought as well.An underlying hypothesis of the panel is that the differences in approach arise in large measure from differences in objective and differences in assumptions about the software development context. Thus, for example, one approach may be intended to support very long range organizational objectives, while the other may be more tactically oriented. One approach may assume that evolvability is an overriding objective, while another may be more focused on speed to market. One may make stronger assumptions about the skills and training of project personnel. The panel will attempt to delve into these issues to see if it may be possible to suggest criteria for suggesting which approach (and possible adaptation) should be selected for a given development situation.In a larger sense, the goal of this panel is to suggest the possibility of a discipline of software process engineering. Insofar as the panel is able to suggest that development situations can be used to guide the selection of process approaches to the provision of assistance, might this then be an indication that process formalisms could play a role in subsequent specification of detailed processes, and evaluation of their effectiveness?The panel will react to this and related questions.

In particular, we present a method for injecting so-called dynamic efforts into a discrete motion sequencing framework that utilizes existing theory of stylistic human movement to inform a principled approach to generating trajectories. Namely, choosing weights in a linear-quadratic cost function leads to trajectories corresponding to the eight basic effort qualities found in dance theory; each weight scales a different motion factor that describes an element of style perceived by an audience. Combined with a stylesensitive motion sequencing scheme, we can fully describe stylistic system behavior. Thus, this paper also reports on the application of this general framework to the problem of generating motion sequences for a humanoid robot that exhibit distinctly different stylistic behaviors though they are composed from the same underlying building blocks.", "authors": ["Amy LaViers", "Magnus Egerstedt"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["16717817-53d6-4816-aeef-679e45c36006", "2c193475-d477-4bb9-91b8-17c27532c72f", "316b0e83-5fe3-4bdb-a4f3-ba26fd2d2133", "32518a4c-fbc3-470f-8024-cb7a65f1fe3f", "33e4f444-6959-43f5-b42d-23851e057136", "4d9393e3-9936-4bd4-8da2-8d3b0360ef93", "84804bfd-d696-4edb-bfd6-ab04c23663fd", "b2acb74b-5102-4910-bc47-5e78c57d89cb", "c1d79126-0975-4119-8fb5-d2bbe082f1fc", "dab547d1-305b-4774-9951-7c5e62181c3b", "dbcea53f-701a-4707-9cbd-c61bb8462237"], "title": "Style based robotic motion", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "526c188f-791c-4727-b22d-200381c4bfc3"}

{"abstract": "Hybrid energy systems, which consist of a load powered by a source and a form of energy storage, find applications in many systems, e.g., the electric grid and electric vehicles. A key problem for hybrid energy systems is the reduction of peak power consumption to ensure cost-efficient operation as peak power draws require additional resources and adversely affect the system reliability and lifetime. Furthermore, in some cases such as electric vehicles, the load dynamics are fast, not perfectly known in advance and the on-board computation power is often limited, making the implementation of traditional optimal control difficult. The authors aim to develop a control scheme to reduce the peak power drawn from the source for hybrid energy systems with limited computation power and limited load forecasts. The authors propose a scheme with two control levels and provide a sufficient condition for control of the different energy storage/generation components to meet the instantaneous load while satisfying a peak power threshold. The scheme provides performance comparable to Model Predictive Control, while requiring less computation power and only coarse-grained load predictions. For a case study, the authors implement the scheme for a battery-supercapacitor-powered electric vehicle with real world drive cycles to demonstrate the low execution time and effective reduction of the battery power (hence temperature), which is crucial to the lifetime of the battery.", "authors": ["Yash Vardhan Pant", "Truong X.

Traditionally, however, these two groups do not talk to each other about educational issues. Then there are the practitioners who attend ICSE who have their own opinions about the relevance, strengths, and shortcomings of current software engineering education offered in universities. The goal of this year's track on Software Engineering Education and Training at ICSE is to bring these three communities together to discuss some urgent questions that have profound effect on how we structure our educational programs. Considering the tremendous changes taking place in the software engineering industry, and in the industrial world in general, it seems appropriate to confront the needs of the software engineering educators.Consider just the following increasingly common developments:  Outsourcing of software projects  Pervasiveness of software in all areas of commerce, industry, and society  Increasingly distributed platforms  Open-source development  Globalization, leading to international (multi-cultural) distributed software teams  How should these developments change the way we teach software engineering? Should textbooks be updated? Should software engineering play a different role in the computer science curriculum, that is, be more pervasive? How are professors in universities handling these issues?These are some of the questions we address in this track.

Automation of testing tools can greatly enhance their power and reduce testing cost. In this paper, techniques for automated test data generation are discussed. Given a program graph, a set of paths are identified to satisfy some given testing criteria. When a path or a program segment is specified, symbolic execution is used for generating input constraints which define a set of inputs for executing this path or segment. Problems encountered in symbolic execution are discussed. A new approach for resolving array reference ambiguities and a procedure for generating test inputs satisfying input constraints are proposed. Array references are recorded in a table during symbolic execution and ambiguities are resolved when test data are generated to evaluate the subscript expressions. The implementation of a test data generator for FORTRAN programs incorporating these techniques is also described.", "authors": ["C. V. Ramamoorthy", "Siu-Bun F. Ho", "W. T.

{"abstract": "The use of computers is pervasive throughout our society. Given the ever-increasing reliance placed upon software, graduates from computing-related degree programs need to be more aware than ever of their responsibilities toward ensuring that society is well served through their creative works. To assist with this effort, a new organization is being proposed for the establishment of a rite-of-passage ceremony for students graduating in the computing sciences that is similar in nature and scope to the Ring Ceremony employed by the Order of the Engineer for students graduating from engineering programs. This new organization is solely intended to promote and recognize the ethical and moral behavior in graduates of computing-related degree programs as they transition to careers of service to society. Two institutions---Ohio Northern University and the University of South Florida---have already experimented with this concept. We seek to start a larger conversation on this concept by soliciting input from the community on what we believe is a significant need for a new organization---an organization that can benefit both our graduates and the computing profession.", "authors": ["John K.

{"abstract": "Distributed pervasive systems have been employed in a wide spectrum of applications, from environmental monitoring, to emergency response. These systems have very strong coordination requirements and are hard to design. Their development becomes even more complex if we consider that they need to be able to adapt to the frequent changes that can occur in the execution environment, or in the resources available to the system.   We present A-3, a model and a self-organizing distributed middleware for designing and implementing high-volume and highly volatile distributed systems. It focuses on the coordination needs of such systems, yet it also provides designers with a clear view of where they can include control loops, and how they can coordinate them for global management.   We have evaluated A-3 on an example in which we want to increase the efficiency and safety of staff and patients in a health-care environment using an RFID-based distributed surveillance system. The experiments we present evaluate the scalability, performance, and robustness of our middleware, and compare it with two plausible alternatives: a completely centralized solution, and a decentralized one based on Lime, a well-known distributed tuple space framework. We ascertain that, with A-3, a system can avoid overloading its elements by distributing the communication load, and that this can be achieved autonomously, regardless of the size of the system itself.", "authors": ["Sam Guinea", "Panteha Saeedi"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["04cc4ea9-e3f8-4600-a6ba-7206957cdd16", "1451dce2-f145-4bce-98e6-19a5e53f5428", "215e5caf-409b-4a3a-a0f3-169c73fa2675", "2d086e42-c4f2-4278-a422-3f30a6f138a6", "36e5a6be-6c23-4734-8c28-4363de228f71", "3d57abb4-d494-4a5a-9f08-8c005b191b8d", "4aec32e6-7bac-483b-9f55-a6deb61a2f3b", "4ca58f74-d0bc-4d0a-9e0f-a3723b2f6786", "4ed47823-88c6-4f13-a207-94195ce60ee1", "62975cb2-4450-4b88-ab86-a6ea4cbbb298", "641cb900-5d78-4955-9040-f9dd0ab9513c", "6bfdf9a3-6cd9-43d8-9785-0073dbe96f1b", "6c19f589-335b-4234-9dc2-1c3f875a3ee7", "76e26074-1e59-496e-bf58-de1ba43d1e72", "8724aad8-f99b-4eb7-ab7b-ca5439715f55", "95405f21-c91f-4e35-ba5d-4a9e01343042", "ce50169a-38f7-45d2-9861-bac477650e28"], "title": "Coordination of distributed systems through self-organizing group topologies", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2012, "id": "52a6c951-44f0-4867-ad6f-e8d5a43497e6"}

The comprehensive framework developed in this paper can be used to address a wide range of complex control problems such as system identification with a priori bound on its order, fixed-order controller design and spectral estimation. To solve the proposed interpolation problem, it is first shown that it can be recast as finding a point in a properly defined semi-algebraic set.

This tree is obtained from the optimal binary tree constructed in Hu and Tan [3], using the technique found in Knuth [5].

{"abstract": "The computer generated virtual environments made possible by virtual reality (VR) may be moved through and manipulated by users in real time [1], but most display methods, including computer monitors, head-mounted displays, or projection screens, have an important limitation\u2014they do not allow users to move around the virtual environment in a natural way. Efforts to remove this limitation include the development in the U.S. of a device similar to a stationary unicycle [3], which attempts to simulate the walking motion of a person sitting upon it. But this lessthan-ideal solution introduces its own restrictions on freedom of movement. By contrast, freedom of movement is not restricted with the fully immersive spherical projection system known as the Cybersphere, developed through joint research by VR Systems and the University of Warwick, both in the U.K. Users who enter this spherical system\u2014which represents a new approach to VR visualization\u2014can walk, run, jump, or crawl in any direction, while at the same time being able to observe an allencompassing virtual environment. In this article we describe where the Cybersphere fits in the world of virtual reality interfaces, and discuss ways it can be applied to a cross-sectional audience, ranging from simple component visualization to highly complex military simulations. Since the advent into VR in 1965, when Ivan Sutherland presented a paper describing the concepts of the Head Mounted Display (HMD), several systems have been developed to \u201cperceive\u201d physical objects. The Cybersphere, launched in October 2000, is the latest such system; others include the cathode ray tube (CRT), the head mounted display (HMD), the binocular omni-oriented monitor (BOOM), and a projection screen environment known as a CAVE. Following is a brief description of each.", "authors": ["Kiran Jude Fernandes", "Vinesh Raja", "Julian Eyre"], "n_citation": 67, "references": ["4a55e255-1742-4ff8-8337-a3d371f6fd05", "9c426c05-ad28-40d9-9a0b-01a470484681", "ebbf479f-9585-423b-a2f5-a236e48f97ce"], "title": "Cybersphere: the fully immersive spherical projection system", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2003, "id": "534466c8-701e-4667-9b2f-c252f98bb596"}
{"abstract": "IF  A TREE falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, does it make a sound? In the realm of content-based image retrieval, the question is: if an image is captured and recorded but no one is there to annotate it, does it ever again make an appearance? Over the last decade we have witnessed an explosion in the number and throughput of imaging devices. At the same time, advances in computer hardware and communications have made it increasingly possible to capture, store, and transmit image data at a low cost. Billions of images and videos are hosted publicly on the Web; cameras embedded in mobile devices are commonplace. Climatologists compile large volumes of satellite imagery in search of long-term trends that might elucidate glacial activity and its impact on water supplies.

{"abstract": "Software reuse has been endorsed as a way to reduce development times and costs while increasing software quality and reliability. Techniques designed to encourage software reuse have concentrated on creating reusable software in the form of frameworks, reuse repositories, and component libraries. These approaches do not help a developer who wants to leverage, from an existing system, a complex feature that was not designed to be reusable. We propose an approach that allows developers to investigate the reuse potential of a feature within an existing system, to create a plan for reusing the feature, and to support the transformation of the feature to the developer's project. We believe that by providing explicit support for the reuse of large-scale source code features, the reuse process---and its benefits---can be made accessible to developers.", "authors": ["Reid Holmes"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1a50cb82-42ee-4d26-b74c-cccf045855f0", "41d61ab8-efb3-4b3f-a678-016f31194368", "4df004e1-b013-4da9-8157-0999add3a12b", "502076a0-ff08-41a8-b118-a8dadd357d4a", "50424e5b-07bb-4d7f-818a-d2aac87e787e", "646c2c09-fdf0-4f39-9109-57d5eae61435", "ab6ddb64-9f0d-4f84-b176-1091f7200dd3", "b6624ba3-c774-4063-a583-73562b62ac86", "baf09f7a-47b5-4b48-83d8-c32038348d33", "c4079773-e3b1-4ac5-9012-32387ff84e2a", "e1cfb778-f574-40a4-a00c-5f7655102451", "f371c0c3-1b63-40d4-9900-743a2deff9af", "f829dffc-3599-4527-8474-51343e55aef3", "f9fbe00e-2980-4c0e-a9b1-4e62fd5fa383"], "title": "Unanticipated reuse of large-scale software features", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2006, "id": "534a1703-32f0-4fc0-8c39-58d0b3becbb3"}

In this paper, an asymmetric shifted Prandtl-Ishlinskii (ASPI) model was first proposed, being composed by three components: a Prandtl-Ishlinskii (PI) operator, a shift operator and a Lipschitz-continuous function. The benefits for such a model are that it can represent the asymmetric hysteresis behavior and facilities construction of the analytic inverse model for the purpose of mitigating the hysteresis effects of the magnetostrictive actuator. Experimental tests were then conducted on the magnetostrictive actuator.

{"abstract": "Spreadsheets are widely used by end users for numerical computation in their business. Spreadsheet cells whose computation is subject to the same semantics are often clustered in a row or column. When a spreadsheet evolves, these cell clusters can degenerate due to ad hoc modifications or undisciplined copy-and-pastes. Such degenerated clusters no longer keep cells prescribing the same computational semantics, and are said to exhibit ambiguous computation smells. Our empirical study finds that such smells are common and likely harmful. We propose AmCheck, a novel technique that automatically detects and repairs ambiguous computation smells by recovering their intended computational semantics.

{"abstract": "A formal system is presented which abstracts the notions of data item, function, and relation. It is argued that the system is more suitable than set theory (or its derivatives) for the concise and accurate description of program semantics. It is shown how the system can be used to build composite data types out of simpler ones with the operations of rowing, structuring, and uniting. It is also demonstrated that completely new primitive types can be introduced into languages through the mechanism of singleton data types.  Both deterministic and nondeterministic functions are shown to be definable in the system. It is described how the local environment can be modeled as a data item and how imperative statements can be considered functions on the environment. The nature of recursive functions is briefly discussed, and a technique is presented by which they can be introduced into the system. The technique is contrasted with the use of the paradoxical combinator,  Y . The questions of local and global environments and of various modes of function calling and parameter passing are touched upon.

{"abstract": "Abstraction is one of the most important strategies for dealing with the state space explosion problem in model checking. With an abstract model, the state space is largely reduced, however, a counterexample found in such a model that does not satisfy the desired property may not exist in the concrete model. Therefore, how to check whether a reported counterexample is spurious is a key problem in the abstraction-refinement loop. Particularly, there are often thousands of millions of states in systems of industrial scale, how to check spurious counterexamples in these systems practically is a significant problem. In this paper, by re-analyzing spurious counterexamples, a new formal definition of spurious path is given. Based on it, efficient algorithms for detecting spurious counterexamples are presented. By the new algorithms, when dealing with infinite counterexamples, the finite prefix to be analyzed will be polynomially shorter than the one dealt by the existing algorithm. Moreover, in practical terms, the new algorithms can naturally be parallelized that makes multi-core processors contributes more in spurious counterexample checking. In addition, by the new algorithms, the state resulting in a spurious path ({false state}) that is hidden shallower will be reported earlier. Hence, as long as a {false state} is detected, lots of iterations for detecting all the {false states} will be avoided.

{"abstract": "A design method for time-delayed vision-based DC motor control is presented and experimentally validated. Both proportional-velocity (PV) and proportional-integral-velocity (PIV) feedback controllers are considered. When vision is used to measure the angular displacement of the motor shaft time delays arise due to image processing. Such delays must be considered in the controller design or can lead to poor performance and even instability. In this research we use right- most eigenvalue assignment, based on the Lambert W function method, to design PV and PIV controllers. Experimental results validate previous theoretical and simulation studies (18), (19). I. INTRODUCTION In this paper, the Lambert W function-based method (17) is used in experiments to design proportional-velocity (PV) and proportional-integral-velocity (PIV) controllers for the time-delayed vision-based angular position control of DC motors. In previous work (18), a simulation case study was provided to illustrate the effectiveness of the design method in terms of design convenience, robustness, and system performance. For the experimental study presented here, the design method in (18) is used for a time delay caused by image processing in the feedback loop. Many existing techniques require a completely redesigned controller to handle time delays. However, the approach based on the Lambert W function does not require one to change the control structure relative to the non-delay case. Also, the proposed method makes use of an analytical solution form, not depending on approximation or prediction, resulting in improved accuracy and robustness (18). First, an open-loop model is combined with a PV controller. The closed-loop model is converted into a system of DDEs (a matrix-vector form). Then, by using the Lambert W function approach, the rightmost eigenvalues are obtained. The PV control gains are calculated by assigning the rightmost eigen- values to desired locations in the left half-plane (LHP) of the complex plane. Subsequently, the controller is implemented and experimentally validated by using the DC motor system (see Fig. 1). Experimental results are good, but show a steady state error due to unmodeled friction effects. Consequently, a PIV controller is implemented and shown to reduce the steady state error. Vision-based control systems have received interest to due convenience and the need to mimic the human sense", "authors": ["Sun Yi", "A.

{"abstract": "At the core of model-driven software development, model-transformation compositions enable automatic generation of executable artifacts from models. Although the advantages of transformational software development have been explored by numerous academics and industry practitioners, adoption of the paradigm continues to be slow, and limited to specific domains. The main challenge to adoption is the fact that maintenance tasks, such as analysis and management of model-transformation compositions and reflecting code changes to model transformations, are still largely unsupported by tools. My dissertation aims at enhancing the field's understanding around the maintenance issues in transformational software development, and at supporting the tasks involved in the synchronization of evolving system features with their generation environments.

However, just few significant results have been published so far. In this paper, we propose a novel and formal Bayesian definition of surprise as the basis for quantitative analysis to measure degrees of uncertainty and deviations of self-adaptive systems from normal behavior. A surprise measures how observed data affects the models or assumptions of the world during runtime. The key idea is that a \"surprising'' event can be defined as one that causes a large divergence between the belief distributions prior to and posterior to the event occurring. In such a case the system may decide either to adapt accordingly or to flag that an abnormal situation is happening.

{"abstract": "Future software systems will be intelligent and adaptive. They will have the ability to seamlessly integrate with smart applications that have not been explicitly designed to work together. Traditional software engineering approaches offer limited support for the development of intelligent systems. To handle the tremendous complexity and the new engineering challenges presented by intelligence, adaptiveness and seamless integration, developers need higher-level development constructs. Agent concepts are natural to describe intelligent adaptive systems. Agent-based technologies have been incorporating software engineering practices, and have matured to offer useful insights and concrete practices to mainstream software engineers. This tutorial presents the state of the art in agent development from a software engineering perspective, focusing on practices that are applicable today. We have walked the audience through analysis, design and verification of a portion of a real-world problem, a smart home network. We show how agent concepts more naturally match the engineering challenges of such systems like trust between adaptive components.

{"abstract": "In 1999, the National Telecommunications and Information Administration report  Falling through the Net  noted that \"NTIA has found that there is still a significant \"digital divide\" separating American information \"haves\" and \"have nots.\" Indeed, in many instances, the digital divide has  widened  in the last year.\" From the Internet's earliest days, there has been concern about its possible pernicious social effects. Even as millions began Internet surfing, critics averred the Internet was also harming users by destroying social interaction and eroding community involvement. Yet we may ask, what have been the experiences of the bulk of Internet users? Have they experienced loss of friends and involvement in the world due to Internet use, as claimed? Has their social world become hollow? These questions need to be addressed with the best data available. We are trying to answer these questions as part of the Syntopia Project, which has tracked growth and influence in ordinary life of the Internet since the mid-1990s. The Project's basic conclusion in 2002 was that the online and off-line world are becoming blended, and that concerns about lack of community are overblown. This view has been further reinforced by results from our most recent survey.   In February and March, 2007, we conducted a nationally representative survey of 1404 Americans 18 years of age and older. This survey explored several dimensions of the way people are using the Internet, including how much they are involved in games and online simulations, their feelings of community, and the extent to which they are making online friendships, including friendships that migrate from the virtual world to the physical world. We found that 67% of respondents (N = 943) were Internet users (compared to the 71% reported by the Pew Internet in American Life Project, and the 70% reported by Internet World Stats, (both of which included people below the age of 18). Surprisingly, in light of all the concern about a gender gap in terms of Internet usage, there were almost identical levels of usage by men and women (a trend that we discerned as early as our 2000 survey).   Many respondents use the Internet intensively. About one out of three respondents say they spend three or more hours on the Internet in a typical day, while two thirds of users spend one or two hours a day (47% estimate one hour a day, and 20% estimate two hours per day). 28% estimate they use it between three to nine hours per day, and 5% are online more than nine hours a day. There were no significant differences between males and females across these levels of Internet usage.   Given its image as something that only teens do (and that we only surveyed those 18 or older), our results showed that multiplayer gaming is thriving with 9.7% of Internet users playing them. We asked \"Do you play online games that involve other players? Like Second Life, World of Warcraft or the SIMS\"? Males (5.4%) play them in slightly greater proportion than females (4.3%).   At the Internet's outset, there was much concern about the isolating and potentially depressing effects of the Internet. While our 2007 survey did not definitively address these questions, it did find that one-fifth of Internet users consider themselves to be \"a member of an online community.\" There was practically no difference between males and females in the answers to this question. Moreover, there was very little difference between the genders in terms of how many friends they made online -- a median of about five.   In fact, far from isolating people from social interaction, the Internet is a source of new face-to-face friendships, perhaps restoring some of the sociability that has been eroded due to television and suburbia (as argued persuasively by Putnam in Bowling Alone [2001]). As Table 1 shows, the Internet has spawned many new virtual friendships. About 16% of respondents have made a friend through the Internet. As was the case with Internet community, there is virtually no difference in male (17%) versus female (14%) responses to these questions.   In addition, just over half (54%) of these people who have made a new online friend have gone on to meet the new friend in person, with slightly more males (59%) than females (50%) doing so. A quick but very rough extrapolation can be made to estimate the number of new face-to-face friendships. In the United States there are approximately 225 million people over the age of 18; as approximately 70% of them are online, this means that there are approximately 157.5 million adults online. Assuming 16% of these made even just one friend on line, this results in an estimated 25.2 million new friendships. Continuing the assumption, if 54% of those went on to meet two new friends in person (based on our data, and assuming just one meeting with each), that would mean that there have been 27 million face-to-face meetings due to the Internet involvement. Of course, this is only crude estimate, yet nonetheless it clearly gives a sense that the Internet is a pro-social technology.   Our data also refute the notion that the Internet is still the domain of males, geeks, and young people. In 1999, the NTIA report there is still a significant digital divide. While these groups continue to have an impressive presence online, the face of the today's Internet is much more reflective of the overall population, at least with respect to gender. In particular, sharp assertions about the Internet being discriminatory against, irrelevant to, or unfriendly towards females finds very little support it in our current national survey (as in our 2000 survey). To the extent computer professionals dedicated to producing new Internet-based services may have labored under a cloud of fear that their work was exacerbating loneliness, gender divides, or the dissipation of social engagement, the findings of this recent survey represent good news.", "authors": ["James E.

{"abstract": "It is very much essential for the multimedia information organization to provide accurate and scalable solutions to map low-level perceptual features to high-level semantics. Therefore automatic and efficient annotation of images is needed for rapid content based retrieval and indexing; it alleviates the disadvantage of any manual annotation. The proposed system for pattern matching and annotation from large image databases has been given based on the combination of Fractal Transform and gentle AdaBoost algorithm. This technique involves two main stages in classification phase wherein first, we make use of gentle AdaBoost algorithm as it is best suited for object detection task and also has lower computational complexity. Next, a mathematical representation is associated to the images of the database, this representation is a set of function parameters resulting from a dedicated fractal interpolation scheme, and used as an index by a retrieval algorithm. Proposed algorithm works completely in the Fractal transform parameter space of both images and patterns, to obtain performances well-matched with an interactive search.

{"abstract": "A new information system is introduced to General Medical Practitioners' (GPs) practice to ease the administrative burden and to help them submit electronic claims. The system is developed and implemented by a central department after very limited consultations with the users. It turns out that the main benefits accrue in the central IS department and that there are very little benefits for the envisaged users. External suppliers follow the requirements analysis of the central department and optimize their own outcomes. The end users, the GPs in question, grow disillusioned with the system, and start to resist it. The system remains in place because of the power of the central purchasing authority but never delivers the promised benefits. Does this story sound familiar? That may be because it has been published in the literature (case 3 in [4]). It may also be because it is very typical in many respects. There are the typical common ingredients of system failure: lack of communication, lack of user involvement, differing agendas, political power games, to name just a few. Many IT practitioners will have come across these. But the question is still open: what can be done about such problems?#R##N##R##N#In this paper we suggest that a suitable and novel way of addressing such organizational problems of IT is what has been called the \"critical approach\". The word \"critical\" can have a variety of different meanings when applied to IT. Software can be mission critical, which means very important. Systems analysts are supposed to be critical thinkers and this suggests they should spot logical flaws in requirements or design. Users can be critical of systems, implying that they do not approve of them. However, in academic texts, the term \"critical\" (as in \"critical theory\" or \"critical social sciences\") has taken on a more specific meaning. The critical approach to information systems has been known to researchers for quite a while and is generally acknowledged to be an alternative to either \"positivism\" or \"interpretivism\". #R##N##R##N#Despite a growing attention to critical research in academic circles, there seems to be little corresponding activity among IT practitioners. We believe that IT / IS practice could benefit greatly from the critical approach and will therefore use this paper to investigate why little practical activity is taking place in the area. In a second step we will then demonstrate why critical research would be beneficial for IT professionals. In a final section we will consider how practitioners can benefit from critical ideas without falling into the dual trap of either trivializing the approach or becoming lost in its complexities.", "authors": ["Bernd Carsten Stahl", "Carole Brooke"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["00dabd84-34d9-4f09-bc11-3a529513988d", "2229110e-75b8-4632-b116-49902a1a8e90", "2db713f5-349b-4414-bf98-a4bc518b01e1", "52ab8dd8-cdb4-4dca-ad44-b0daaf892da8", "6f793a28-8968-4d29-a5bf-8c5a0fbd302e", "7982aa77-87ce-4c1f-ada2-b9cbb243646c", "b551d57c-b637-4609-ae27-cd6601bfc85e"], "title": "The contribution of critical IS research", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2008, "id": "54598917-c884-4a00-bca7-8035e872e459"}

{"abstract": "The Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML) and Java provide a standardized, portable and platform- independent way to render dynamic, interactive 3D scenes across the Internet. Integrating two powerful and portable software languages provides interactive 3D graphics plus complete programming capabilities plus network access. Intended for programmers and scene authors, this paper provides a VRML overview, synopsizes the open development history of the specification, provides a condensed summary of VRML 3D graphics nodes and scene graph topology, describes how Java interacts with VRML through detailed examples, and examines a variety of VRML/Java future developments. Overview. The Web is being extended to three spatial dimensions thanks to VRML, a dynamic 3D scene description language that can include embedded behaviors and camera animation. A rich set of graphics primitives provides a common-denominator file format which can be used to describe a wide variety of 3D scenes and objects. The VRML specification is now an International Standards Organization (ISO) specification (VRML 97). Why VRML and Java together? Over twenty million VRML browsers have shipped with Web browsers, making interactive 3D graphics suddenly available for any desktop. Java adds complete programming capabilities plus network access, making VRML fully functional and portable. This is a powerful new combination, especially as ongoing research shows that VRML plus Java provide extensive support for building large-scale virtual environments (LSVEs).

{"abstract": "Dynamic evolution of distributed component-based systems (DCS) is an important task in software engineering. Several challenges are posed in this process. For example, how to preserve consistency during evolution and how to reflect the abstract evolution specification in the concrete reconfiguration implementation. Having observed the generality of software architecture, researchers have proposed various architectural description languages (ADLs), enabling evolution techniques, etc. to investigate the problem. These approaches typically employ the formal semantics of dynamic ADLs at the incremental levels of refinement in the design phase or the explicit maintenance of software architecture at runtime. However, different ADLs usually address different concerns and the lack of runtime support for the causal relation between ADLs and the running system easily leads to the mismatch between them, thus inevitably sacrifices their usability. We propose an approach based on a runtime architecture which is visually generated from an attributed type graph meta-model, exists through the lifecycle of DCS, establishes the causal relation between architectural topology and system configuration, and directs the dynamic evolution.", "authors": ["Yu Zhou"], "n_citation": 8, "references": ["19ec4ea4-5239-4b02-ad01-44b3d6eef3d6", "27e18737-075a-4470-97ed-67636951dfe8", "579836fd-6e82-42e2-9015-c718c1f23815", "7ae75419-cc48-4386-bb2d-590f66e32770", "8292d169-f379-4939-a8dd-67f6bfafa956", "9448e3b0-b8cc-4cab-86e7-5dc85eb2bdc5", "be574ead-16cd-4846-b2a8-ea28b33b6026", "e3916584-9e4f-4d35-a311-c3810dbca602", "eff9adf0-c70b-42cc-9d6d-47ec62958c23", "fbc698e5-5dbb-4e8e-b52b-86bad6ee6349"], "title": "A runtime architecture-based approach for the dynamic evolution of distributed component-based systems", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2008, "id": "54881e20-dc09-4697-a368-579ae50b714c"}

{"abstract": "It is unfortunate that almost all of the presently used algebraic languages do not provide the capability of linear algebra. Operations such as the inner product of vectors, the product of two matrices, and the multiplication of a matrix by a scaler must inevitably be written out in detail in terms of the individual components. The reasons usually given for avoiding linear algebra in these languages are (1) the difficulties which would arise in scanning linear algebraic expressions, and (2) the uncertainty involved as to the amount of temporary storage needed during the evaluation of linear algebraic expressions when the program is executed. The purpose of this paper is to show how these two types of difficulties can be overcome. Although suggestions have been made for even further increasing the general capability of ALGOL such as including the ability to form a matrix from a collection of vectors, we shall be content here to consider the ordinary operations of linear algebra. Even if this much becomes available in algebraic languages, considerable progress will have been made.

{"abstract": "Location-based computing (LBC) is becoming increasing important in both industry and academia. A key challenge is the pervasive deployment of LBC technologies; to be effective they must run on a wide variety of client platforms, including laptops, PDAs, and mobile phones, so that location data can be acquired anywhere and accessed by any application. Moreover, as a nascent area, LBC is experiencing rapid innovation in sensing technologies, the positioning algorithms themselves, and the applications they support. Lastly, as a newcomer, LBC must integrate with existing communications and application technologies, including web browsers and location data interchange standard.This paper describes our experience in developing the Place Lab architecture, a widely used first-generation open source toolkit for client-side location sensing. Using a layered, pattern-based architecture, it supports modular development in any dimension of LBC, enabling the field to move forward more rapidly as these innovations are shared with the community as pluggable components. Our experience shows the benefits of domain-specific abstractions, and how we overcame high-level language constraints to support a wide array of platforms in this emerging space.

We describe the specific behaviors which shape an individual\u2019s perceived control, and thus motivation, in our context, and investigate the underlying causes for these behaviors by assessing them in accordance with extant social-psychological theory. We find that the very nature of XP itself imparts strong psychological pressures on participants which can positively affect their interactions, and thus, motivation.

{"abstract": "Target audience: Software practitioners and researchers wanting to understand the state of the art in using data science for software engineering (SE). Content: In the age of big data, data science (the knowledge of deriving meaningful outcomes from data) is an essential skill that should be equipped by software engineers. It can be used to predict useful information on new projects based on completed projects. This tutorial offers core insights about the state-of-the-art in this important field. What participants will learn: Before data science: this tutorial discusses the tasks needed to deploy machine-learning algorithms to organizations (Part 1: Organization Issues). During data science: from discretization to clustering to dichotomization and statistical analysis. And the rest: When local data is scarce, we show how to adapt data from other organizations to local problems. When privacy concerns block access, we show how to privatize data while still being able to mine it. When working with data of dubious quality, we show how to prune spurious information. When data or models seem too complex, we show how to simplify data mining results. When data is too scarce to support intricate models, we show methods for generating predictions. When the world changes, and old models need to be updated, we show how to handle those updates. When the effect is too complex for one model, we show how to reason across ensembles of models.

This paper presents a case study of the implementation of one corporate-wide program, focusing particularly on the unexpected difficulties of collecting a small number of straightforward metrics. Several mechanisms causing these difficulties are identified, including attenuated communication across organizational boundaries, inertia created by existing data collection systems, and the perceptions, expectations, and fears about how the data will be used. We describe how these factors influence the interpretation of the definitions of the measurements and influence the degree of conformance that is actually achieved.

The target state vector is estimated from available measurements of range, azimuth, and elevation angle provided by a ground based sensor or an on-board seeker antenna.

Additionally, the state vector of each UAV is assumed to be corrupted by measurement noise and available from their own on-board sensors, namely GPS + IMU. The estimated states of the chasers and the target are utilized in a 3D nonlinear guidance law designed based on a backstepping like technique, which provides signals for the velocity, flight path, and course/heading angle to achieve the consensus of target tracking.

{"abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of stabilization of multiple feedback control loops subject to signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. We consider in particular a two loop cascade control configuration and a coupled configuration that arises in control of water canals. In the cascade configuration we first study the presence of one communication channel, initially modeled as a memoryless additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and in a later stage as an additive colored Gaussian noise channel (ACGN) with memory. We then discuss the more challenging case of two simultaneous channels, one in the inner loop and one in the outer loop at different locations in each loop. In the water canal inspired configuration we consider n feedback loops and discuss the presence of communication channels, either memoryless AWGN channels or ACGN channels with memory, all simultaneously over the measurement path of each loop (between the plant and the controller), or over the control path of each loop (between the controller and the plant).", "authors": ["Alejandro J.

The features of imperative languages like Fortran, Algol 60, PL/I, Pascal, Modula-2, C, and Ada considered are data types, data structures, control structures, program units, scope of names, and parameter passing. Some of the corresponding features of functional languages like Lisp, logic programming languages like Prolog, and ohject-oriented programming languages like C++ and Smalltalk, are reviewed. Finally brief consideration is given to syntax and semantics, chiefly by reference to the Backus-Naur form, BNF. The features of programming languages affect all aspects of programming, including the ease of writing and maintaining programs, the reliahility of software, and the efficiency and portability of programs. Knowledge of programming language concepts and constructs is of importance to software developers, programmers, and designers of programming languages and compilers. The topic of this procedure should be of interest to any computer science student or practitioner who wishes to test his or her knowledge and learn more about one of the most important and broad areas in the computer field. The language used most often in the questions is Pascal, with Ada, Lisp, and Prolog also featured prominently. A glossary is included which defines some of the terms used in the procedure.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a new approach for leveraging the power of theorem provers for formal verification to provide sufficient conditions that can be checked on embedded control designs. Theorem provers are often most efficient when using generic models that abstract away many of the controller details, but with these abstract models very general conditions can be verified under which desirable properties such as safety can be guaranteed for the closed-loop system. We propose an approach in which these sufficient conditions are static conditions that can be checked for the specific controller design, without having to include the dynamics of the plant. We demonstrate this approach using the KeYmaera theorem prover for differential dynamic logic for two examples: an intelligent cruise controller and a cooperative intersection collision avoidance system (CICAS) for left-turn assist. In each case, safety of the closed-loop system proved using KeYmaera provides static sufficient conditions that are checked for the controller design.", "authors": ["Nikos Arechiga", "Sarah M.

{"abstract": "Introduction    User-Generated Content (UGC) IS A BURGEONING social phenomenon being watched in today's world with keen interest. UGC is an online new-media content created by users rather than by conventional media such as broadcasters. A typical example would be Flickr, an online photo-sharing site with 37 million images, to which its 1.2 million members add up to 200,000 images daily. UGC is shifting the paradigm of Internet use away from the one-way propagation of media content by companies towards the creation and sharing of media content by and among ordinary users.   The mobile phone is an especially important means of promoting user generation and exchange of media content. Many mobile phones now have built-in digital cameras and inherent network connectivity. These features have greatly facilitated the creation and sharing of media content. For instance, users can immediately upload photos on Flickr with their mobile phones as well as access Flickr and browse other people's media content.   However, the constraints of a typical mobile phone---its small display and limited number of buttons---make use of mobile UGC services challenging. Only a few studies have investigated hardware or software alternatives to address these problems. This article presents a new user interface (UI) for mobile phones, one that makes use of UGC services easier and more efficient.   The new interface has two key characteristics: one pertaining to content structure, and another to content visualization. More specifically, the new UI employs two major mobile Web 2.0 technologies, the tag and the tag cloud, and multi-display buttons increase the display size and flexibility of individual buttons. The interface is dedicated specifically towards supporting exploratory browsing within mobile UGC services, because users of such services are likely to focus on exploratory browsing and serendipitous discovery and be more inclined toward entertainment rather than utility. Here, we describe the new interface and investigate whether it aids in enhancing exploratory browsing within mobile UGC services.", "authors": ["Seongwoon Kim", "Inseong Lee", "Kiho Lee", "Seungki Jung", "Joonah Park", "Yeun Bae Kim", "Sang Ryong Kim", "Jinwoo Kim"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["21e6c5b4-b587-4735-9c73-f50f6e9996e6", "3abe7150-31bf-4b5e-b209-2800bc5a81f5", "82e957a4-10fb-46a0-b483-d8e61dde67cf", "94c2820b-a2d3-44ca-b0e3-9783f2c662aa", "9c84c2d7-de12-4a76-afd7-32981afdae89", "b13e4021-9b29-4cd4-862e-546af213eadd", "b3a9af20-344a-436c-b09d-b4e7ac490fc9", "bbac1fae-e8d7-449b-b954-f59a4ae1e280", "bcded55a-8e9a-4045-881b-8678bce01cca"], "title": "Mobile Web 2.0 with multi-display buttons", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2010, "id": "55b0e440-e0a3-4a0f-9537-8bd2d72c5c2d"}

{"abstract": "To improve the quality of websites, it is necessary to continually assess and evaluate web metrics and subsequently make improvements. In this research, we have computed nine quantitative web measures for each website using an automated Web Metrics Analyzer tool developed in JAVA programming language. The website quality prediction models are developed utilizing ANFIS-Subtractive clustering and ANFIS-FCM based FIS models, to classify the quality of website as good or bad. The models are validated using 10 cross validation on a collection of web pages of Pixel Awards web metrics collected through the tool. The results are analyzed using Area Under Curve obtained from Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. The results showed that both ANFIS-Subtractive and ANFIS-FCM have acceptable performance in terms of specificity and sensitivity. In addition, ANFIS-Subtractive and ANFIS-FCM clearly induces only two rules, which are much less than 512 rules generated by the normal ANFIS model.

{"abstract": "This paper is concerned with a tracking controller design problem for discrete-time networked predictive control systems. The control law used here is a combined state-feedback control and integral control. Since not all the states are available in practice, a local Luenberger is utilized to estimate the state vector. The measured output and the estimated state vector are packed together and transmitted to the tracking controller via a communication channel with a limited capacity. Meanwhile, the control signal is also transmitted through a communication network. Networked-induced delays on both links are considered for the signal transmission and modeled by Markov chains. Moreover, it is assumed that the elements in the Markov transition matrices are subject to uncertainties. In order to fully compensate for the network-induced delay, the controller generates a sequence of control signals which are dependent on each possible delay on the feedforward channel. With the augmenting technique twice and the proposed control law, we obtain delay-free stochastic closed-loop systems and the controlled output is chosen as the tracking error. Sufficient conditions are provided for the energy-to-peak performance of the closed-loop systems. The feedback gains of the controller can be derived by solving a minimization problem. An example is illustrated to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design method.", "authors": ["Hui Zhang", "Yang Shi", "Minqiang Xu", "Hutao Cui"], "n_citation": 90, "references": ["03e9d54f-26d1-45eb-a861-64dc17b391d2", "180ba195-e976-4735-b947-653fef604e8f", "31de2f01-85c2-4872-a04a-76fd0b4e79c5", "33f55ab2-1fe4-4202-b8fa-5858c9f5f697", "69f0b56d-ecfa-4d83-b384-8eae6a2051a6", "6e160fd8-679f-45f6-9cb6-93a53b53ea5c", "6f0db8f2-5ed8-4c23-a4cf-150aaef367ad", "7c927f9c-22f6-4b7d-94cb-62e4fa6b4549", "8bd32f81-b0bf-4b16-af36-2c0e8a400208", "8be12dbb-6376-4716-a7a0-5e521767735b", "9b829c8f-8e4c-441b-acd6-972e2aca4d20", "a68232a1-13a0-470f-9632-6b40674b1e45", "a9c0ab1b-0c3e-4cb2-aed9-8d613996e2f6", "ac2e8959-4c7b-4787-931a-34dfa0196b94", "ba1e3491-bd89-43f9-96b5-310c1869c1f1", "c038bfa5-3eb2-4533-8f7c-02e16029f87c", "ca52b934-af8a-4202-b59a-036547bc7425", "d52b69ce-c68e-4269-8e80-908bfd6691ff", "e07c17af-995e-477a-9808-cb8ef7f8d7e1"], "title": "Observer-based tracking controller design for networked predictive control systems with uncertain Markov delays", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "560e8ab8-8a77-4fd7-9a16-072e21ad5cb6"}

{"abstract": "The paper describes results on two components of a research program focused on motion-based communication mediated by the dynamics of a control system. Specifically we are interested in how mobile agents engaged in a shared activity such as dance can use motion as a medium for transmitting certain types of messages. The first part of the paper adopts the terminology of motion description languages and deconstructs an elementary form of the well-known popular dance, Salsa, in terms of four motion primitives (dance steps). Several notions of dance complexity are introduced. We describe an experiment in which ten performances by an actual pair of dancers are evaluated by judges and then compared in terms of proposed complexity metrics. An energy metric is also defined. Values of this metric are obtained by summing the lengths of motion segments executed by wheeled robots replicating the movements of the human dancers in each of the ten dance performances. Of all the metrics that are considered in this experiment, energy is the most closely correlated with the human judges' assessments of performance quality. The second part of the paper poses a general class of dual objective motion control problems in which a primary objective (artistic execution of a dance step or efficient movement toward a specified terminal state) is combined with a communication objective. Solutions of varying degrees of explicitness can be given in several classes of problems of communicating through the dynamics of finite dimensional linear control systems. In this setting it is shown that the cost of adding a communication component to motions that steer a system between prescribed pairs of states is independent of those states. At the same time, the optimal encoding problem itself is shown to be a problem of packing geometric objects, and it remains open. Current research is aimed at solving such communication-through-action problems in the context of the motion control of mobile robots.", "authors": ["John Baillieul", "Kayhan \u00d6zcimder"], "n_citation": 24, "references": ["316b0e83-5fe3-4bdb-a4f3-ba26fd2d2133", "32952a58-4d71-49e1-bc1a-aa5b2ce5b17c", "3e53114e-b8ee-4b80-b5c5-f28e747aa4a2", "529fa3e1-2200-4a51-91e5-ed7cb5380430", "885c2dac-b169-4d9b-aec9-869a3cb0c57f", "cd319808-b861-409f-a3a1-53b5439df662", "fb563b1e-197f-4776-996e-3f6200f13ca0"], "title": "The control theory of motion-based communication: Problems in teaching robots to dance", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "565e8268-2c13-4f4a-bc25-c7bfe03f8442"}

{"abstract": "As one of the UML's main extension mechanisms, stereotypes play a crucial role in the UML's ability to serve a wide and growing base of users. However, the precise meaning of stereotypes and their intended mode of use has never been entirely clear and has even generated much debate among experts. Two basic ways of using UML stereotypes have been observed in practice: one to support the classification of classes as a means of emulating metamodel extensions, the other to support the classification of objects as a means of assigning them certain properties. In this paper we analyze these two recognized stereotype usage scenarios and explain the rationale for explicitly identifying a third form of usage scenario. We propose some notational concepts which could be used to explicitly distinguish the three usage scenarios and provide heuristics as to when each should be used. Finally, we conclude by proposing enhancements to the UML which could support all three forms cleanly and concisely.", "authors": ["Colin Atkinson", "Thomas K\u00fchne", "Brian Henderson-Sellers"], "n_citation": 35, "references": ["6fdb8535-07d8-49d0-a6c3-be974dfd3e9f", "7af7465a-89d3-4210-9ab3-a03bd0fc869d", "cc57323a-e082-4ef1-9731-5750bd9d5e02", "d9c2e8b1-ac4b-423c-9f09-251d436010be", "db470932-2038-46ae-8246-455dcb70b134"], "title": "Stereotypical Encounters of the Third Kind", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "year": 2002, "id": "57149b8e-bb36-464b-a7d0-ee3da6085a11"}

{"abstract": "It is well-known that distributed architectures such as micro-converters and micro-inverters for photovoltaic (PV) systems can recover between 10%\u201330% of annual performance loss or more that is caused by partial shading and/or module mismatch. In this work, we present a novel multivariable gradient-based extremum-seeking (ES) design to extract maximum power from an arbitrary micro-converter configuration of PV modules, that includes cascade and parallel connections. Conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) schemes for micro-converters (where each PV module is coupled to its own DC-DC converter) employ a decentralized control, with one peak seeking scheme per each PV module, thereby requiring one control loop and two sensors per module (one each for current and voltage). By contrast, the scheme that we present employs a single control loop with just two sensors, one for the overall array output current and the other one for the DC bus voltage. This centralized design provides more flexibility in tuning the parameters of the controller, and also takes into account interactions between PV modules. The computational effort of our design is not higher than that of the conventional scheme, and simulation results using Simulink's SimPowerSystems toolbox show that our proposed design outperforms the conventional one. Thus, our proposed design offers two benefits: (i) the balance-of-system (BOS) cost reduction as a result of the significantly lower number of sensors, and (ii) improved performance, both contributing towards reduced average cost/watt, and enhancing the economic viability of solar.", "authors": ["Azad Ghaffari", "Sridhar Seshagiri", "Miroslav Krstic"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["509cf83e-6638-4582-a61f-c5e058854bb1", "68fa611f-2cdf-44b9-a1b1-c04ee663d3d1", "7c7fcc3b-49fe-49a7-919b-6b26e12e738c", "84099633-9008-4f2b-9774-a1a91a64e184", "d51d7a82-6743-4212-a442-dc408eff4758", "f88218aa-df30-4793-b93d-8d06920e85eb", "fefab3b2-7fdf-43c5-9d51-5759f5b5fe07"], "title": "Power optimization for photovoltaic micro-converters using multivariable gradient-based extremum-seeking", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "5729ddc2-7b15-4dfe-8526-af666d8f3e76"}

This storage arrangement is discussed with its realized advantages in programming systems: simplicity of programmed addressing, flexibility of data structures, efficiency of memory utilization, variability of system composition during execution, means of linkage between programs and from programs to data, and basis for storage protection. The application of labeled blocks may be extended to areas of time-sharing and multi-media storage control.

Today most security incidents are caused by flaws in software, called vulnerabilities. It is estimated that there are as many as 20 flaws per thousand lines of software code. Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) statistics reveal that the number of vulnerabilities reported has increased dramatically over the years, from only 171 in 1995 to 8064 in 2006. Along with vulnerabilities, the sophistication of attack tools has also advanced over time. Using the interconnected nature of the Internet and automated attack tools, attackers exploit software vulnerabilities at an alarming rate to cause serious damage to organizations.   Although the ultimate solution to fix software vulnerabilities is application of patches, until a few years ago the term \"patch management\" was not in the general vocabulary of even the most advanced information technology staff. Today, \"patch management\" is not only in the common vernacular of most IT staff, but it is also one of the most essential responsibilities of IT departments. Security threats stemming from the exploitation of vulnerabilities pose serious risks to corporations, including unauthorized access to systems, corruption or modification of data, and unavailability of system resources to authorized users. Systematically applying patches to vulnerable systems through effective patch management can effectively reduce the number of security lapses. It is estimated that 95% of security breaches could be prevented by keeping systems up-to-date with necessary patches. Though recognized as important for security, many organizations do not have a clear understanding of the elements of patch management and how these elements impact the success of the patch management process.", "authors": ["Thomas A.

{"abstract": "This paper discusses how the synthesis phase of the PSI system constructs programs from high level program models by using coding knowledge and efficiency knowledge. In our preliminary implementation, these knowledge bases are separated into distinct modules, the  coding expert  and the  efficiency expert.  We describe how the coding expert uses rule-based programming knowledge to produce alternative algorithm and data structure choices, and how the efficiency expert selects the best choice by estimating the costs of the alternatives using analysis of algorithm techniques. Communication between the modules centers around descriptions of partially developed programs which are produced by the coding expert and analyzed by the efficiency expert. Our system has implemented several small programs. From our experience with these modules, we conclude that there is a strong interaction between coding and efficiency knowledge which necessitates a corresponding complexity in the communication mechanism.", "authors": ["David R.

{"abstract": "Brazil has been emerging as a destination for IT software and services. The country already had a strong domestic base of IT clients to global companies. One of the competitive factors is time zone location. Brazil has positioned itself as easy for collaboration because of time zone overlap with its primary partners in North America and Europe. In this paper we examine whether time zone proximity is an advantage for software development by conducting a country-level field study of the Brazilian IT industry using a cross section of firms. The results provide some support for the claims of proximity benefits. The Brazil-North dyads use moderate timeshifting that is perceived as comfortable for both sides. The voice coordination that the time overlap permits helps address coordination challenges and foster relationships.

{"abstract": "A total of 840 junior and senior-level undergraduate business students particpated in three experiments that compared computer-generated graphical forms of data presentation to traditional tabular reports. The first experiment compared tables and bar charts for their effects on readability, interpretation accuracy, and decision making. No differences in interpretation accuracy or decision quality were observed for the two groups, although tabular reports were rated as \"easier to read and understand\" than graphical reports. The second experiment compared line plots to tables for their effects on interpretation accuracy and decision quality. Subjects with graphical reports outperformed those with tables. There were no meaningful differences in interpretation accuracy across treatment groups. The third experiment compared graphical and tabular reports for their ability to convey a \"message\" to the reader. Only in situations in which a vast amount of information was presented and relatively simple impressions were to be made, did subjects given graphs outperform those using tables.  This program of cumulative experiments indicates that generalized claims of superiority of graphic presentation are unsupported, at least for decision-related activities. In fact, the experiments suggest that the effectiveness of the data display format is largely a function of the characteristics of the task at hand, and that impressions gleaned from \"one shot\" studies of the effectiveness of the use of graphs may be nothing more than situationally dependent artifacts.", "authors": ["Gary W.

{"abstract": "Watson-Crick DOL systems (WDOL systems) are variants of DOL systems with controlled derivations, inspired by the phenomenon of Watson-Crick complementarity of the familiar double helix of DNA. These systems are defined over a DNA-like alphabet, i.e. each letter has a complementary letter and this relation is symmetric. Depending on a special condition, called the trigger, a parallel rewriting step is applied either to the string or to its complementary string. A network of Watson-Crick DOL systems (an NWDOL system) is a finite set of WDOL systems over a common DNA-like alphabet which act on their own strings in parallel and after each derivation step send copies some of the generated words to the other nodes. In [2] it was shown that the so-called standard NWDOL systems form a class of computationally complete devices, that is, any recursively enumerable language can be determined by a network of standard Watson-Crick DOL systems. In this paper we prove that the computational power of these constructs does not change in the case of a certain type of incomplete information communication, namely where the communicated word is a non-empty prefix of the generated word.

{"abstract": "In Mobile Ad hoc Networks, entire communication solely depends on multi-hop routing in order to cover the larger area through wireless medium. When MANET is applicable for civilian purpose, the cooperation among nodes creates more security issues. Neighbor dependency without any centralized authority is the major vulnerability to different types of internal attacks. Internal attacks can be triggered either by selfish nodes or malicious nodes. Multicast communication makes this security issue more severe where non group members are also the part of multicast routing structure in this communication. In this paper, we analyzed a mesh-based multicast routing protocol PUMA against various types of protocol-dependent internal attacks. Also we have proposed a solution for two particular internal attacks; watchdog-based data packet dropper attacker identification and validating parent's information from core using newly added control packet MA-to-Core for MA packet modification attacks. NS2 simulation results are used to observe the response of protocol performance metrics such as PDR and control overhead against internal attacks. Particularly this research work focuses on security vulnerabilities of PUMA routing protocol and evaluate our proposed solutions for internal attacks using simulation results.", "authors": ["A.

{"abstract": "A simulation model of a time-sharing system with a finite noncontiguous store and an infinite auxiliary store is used to study the variation of system parameters such as store size, number of jobs allowed to execute simultaneously, job-scheduling algorithm, etc. The effects of these variations on a measure of system performance is used to ascertain which of the parameters controllable by the job-scheduling algorithm, including the scheduling itself, require optimization, and which of the parameters not normally controllable by the scheduling algorithm have a marked effect on system performance. System performance is based upon the mean cost of delay to all jobs processed.  It is shown that significant improvements in the measure of system performance can be obtained by using variable time-slice techniques and by selecting the optimum round-robin cycle time. It appears that these features would benefit from optimization whereas other parameters controllable by the scheduling algorithm affect system performance in a predictable manner and would not benefit from optimization.  Features not normally under the control of the scheduling algorithm can also have a marked effect on the measure of performance; in particular, supervisor overheads, the size of the store, and the speed of the CPU.  A comparison is made between the results of the simulation model and two analytical equations for quantum-oriented nonpreemptive time-sharing systems.

Already, this work has shown promising results in planning and control of nonlinear systems in high dimensional state spaces.

In terms of modeling power, the new framework is more general than previous work, and can apply to any noisy dynamical system. Also, we obtain analytical solutions for the optimal value function of continuous-state control problems with linear dynamics and a very flexible class of cost functions.

{"abstract": "Errors in dynamic random access memory (DRAM) are a common form of hardware failure in modern compute clusters. Failures are costly both in terms of hardware replacement costs and service disruption. While a large body of work exists on DRAM in laboratory conditions, little has been reported on real DRAM failures in large production clusters. In this paper, we analyze measurements of memory errors in a large fleet of commodity servers over a period of 2.5 years. The collected data covers multiple vendors, DRAM capacities and technologies, and comprises many millions of dual in-line memory module (DIMM) days.   The goal of this paper is to answer questions such as the following: How common are memory errors in practice? What are their statistical properties? How are they affected by external factors, such as temperature and utilization, and by chip-specific factors, such as chip density, memory technology, and DIMM age?   We find that DRAM error behavior in the field differs in many key aspects from commonly held assumptions. For example, we observe DRAM error rates that are orders of magnitude higher than previously reported, with 25,000--70,000 errors per billion device hours per Mb and more than 8% of DIMMs affected by errors per year. We provide strong evidence that memory errors are dominated by hard errors, rather than soft errors, which previous work suspects to be the dominant error mode. We find that temperature, known to strongly impact DIMM error rates in lab conditions, has a surprisingly small effect on error behavior in the field, when taking all other factors into account. Finally, unlike commonly feared, we do not observe any indication that newer generations of DIMMs have worse error behavior.", "authors": ["Bianca Schroeder", "Eduardo Pinheiro", "Wolf-Dietrich Weber"], "n_citation": 561, "references": ["4ae605ef-10a5-43a9-9ca5-df4fb4b9720c", "58f71435-c85c-4840-88c1-9038d95d9310", "6b4fff83-d210-4ece-afde-4e9d016734db", "7083f8af-ef07-4ade-a3c0-b404444f9f74", "735afbb8-9c7f-4b7f-8417-8047296f0b16", "781eb39c-7ea9-44b0-b15b-c8ad0c143d87", "9653657a-9627-40c0-b051-c0e22dab2f08", "976b77e6-1793-4a5c-aafb-e973442fc300", "be6e9acf-ea94-4d50-ac36-b8937fa344ae", "d5560e44-46ec-458b-afe6-344320e9a45a", "db0f61d8-c8cc-428f-ac1f-710f10b16b4d"], "title": "DRAM errors in the wild: a large-scale field study", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2011, "id": "58521c9d-d807-44a8-b598-167af792656d"}

Usually, sharing is accomplished by allowing several users to share data via input and output of information stored in files kept in secondary storage. Through the use of segmentation, however, Multics provides direct hardware addressing by user and system programs of all information, independent of its physical storage location. Information is stored in segments each of which is potentially sharable and carries its own independent attributes of size and access privilege.  Here, the design and implementation considerations of segmentation and sharing in Multics are first discussed under the assumption that all information resides in a large, segmented main memory. Since the size of main memory on contemporary systems is rather limited, it is then shown how the Multics software achieves the effect of a large segmented main memory through the use of the Honeywell 645 segmentation and paging hardware.", "authors": ["Alain Bensoussan", "C.

{"abstract": "Web 2.0 is affecting the structure of our society by creating new spaces of freedom, giving voice to any opinion, easing interpersonal relationships, and encouraging the creation of collaborating collectivities. Technologies such as blog, podcasting, wiki, and news feeds have the power to transform every user from a mere information consumer to a potential producer, from a spectator to an actor. The success of YouTube, MySpace, Facebook, and Wikipedia is under everybody's eyes. Generally speaking, Web 2.0 is seen as a powerful tool that, by exploiting Internet technologies, supplies services to the society, helping the entire socio-cultural system to develop and to move toward a democratic direction.   Unfortunately, this imagery is partially distorted: first, Web 2.0 and Internet technologies are differently accessible by different parts of the society and, second, as many sociologists pointed out, their applications often appeal to users' egoistic purposes and self-celebration spirit. Although we cannot dismiss the value of current Web 2.0 applications, we are convinced there is a much more valuable potential that has not been exploited yet. By comparing the immense benefits that Web 2.0 could bring to the whole society, with its factual employment, one could provocatively change the meaning of the acronym WWW into World Wide  Waste.

{"abstract": "The purpose of this paper is to present a comparison of some computer simulation languages and of some of the packages by which each is implemented. Some considerations involved in comparing software packages for digital computers are discussed in Part I. The issue is obvious: users of digital computers must choose from available languages or write their own. Substantial costs can occur, particularly in training, implementation and computer time if an inappropriate language is chosen. More and more computer simulation languages are being developed: comparisons and evaluations of existing languages are useful for designers and implementers as well as users.  The second part is devoted to computer simulation and simulation languages. The computational characteristics of simulation are discussed with special attention being paid to a distinction between continuous and discrete change models. Part III presents a detailed comparison of six simulation languages and packages: SIMSCRIPT, CLP, CSL, GASP, GPSS and SOL. The characteristics of each are summarized in a series of tables. The implications of this analysis for designers of languages, for users, and for implementers are developed.

{"abstract": "Abstract \u0097We consider a multiplayer reach-avoid game withan equal number of attackers and defenders moving with simpledynamics on a two-dimensional domain possibly with obstacles.The attacking team attempts to send as many attackers to acertain target location as possible quickly while the defendersaim to capture the attackers to prevent the attacking teamfrom reaching its goal. The analysis of problems like this playsan important role in collision avoidance, motion planning, andaircraft control, among other applications. Computing optimalsolutions for such multiplayer games is intractable due tonumerical intractibility. This paper provides a rst attempt toaddress such computational intractability by combining max-imum matching in graph theory with the classical Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs approach. In addition, our solution provides aninitial step to take cooperation into account by computingmaximum matching in real time. I. I NTRODUCTION Differential games are powerful theoretical tools inrobotics, aircraft control, security, and other domains [1],[2], [3]. The multiplayer reach-avoid game (to be denedprecisely in Section II) is a differential game between twoadversarial teams of cooperating players, where one teamattempts to reach a certain target quickly while the other teamaims to delay, or if possible, prevent the opposing team fromreaching the target. One example of a reach-avoid game isthe popular game Capture-the-Flag (CTF) [4], [5]. In roboticsand automation, CTF has been explored most notably in theCornell Roboag competition, where two opposing teamsof mobile robots are directed by human players to play thegame [6]. A number of results related to motion planningand human-robot interactions have been reported from thecompetition [7], [8], [9], [10].A multiplayer reach-avoid game is a complex game dueto both the conicting goals of the two teams and thecooperation among the players within each team, renderingthe optimal solution for each team nontrivial to obtain andvisualize. Previous work [4], [5] has shown that even in a 1vs. 1 scenario, human agents are sometimes unable to nd theoptimal way to play, losing in situations in which an optimalwinning strategy exists.

However, not all test failures reported during code integration are hinting towards code defects. Testing large systems such as the Microsoft Windows operating system requires complex test infrastructures, which may lead to test failures caused by faulty tests and test infrastructure issues. Such  false test alarms  are particular annoying as they raise engineer attention and require manual inspection without providing any benefit. The goal of this work is to use empirical data to minimize the number of false test alarms reported during system and integration testing. To achieve this goal, we use association rule learning to identify patterns among failing test steps that are typically for false test alarms and can be used to automatically classify them. A successful classification of false test alarms is particularly valuable for product teams as manual test failure inspection is an expensive and time-consuming process that not only costs engineering time and money but also slows down product development. We evaluating our approach on system and integration tests executed during  Windows 8.1  and Microsoft  Dynamics AX  development. Performing more than 10,000 classifications for each product, our model shows a mean precision between 0.85 and 0.90 predicting between 34% and 48% of all false test alarms.", "authors": ["Kim Herzig", "Nachiappan Nagappan"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["00da2158-c473-4fa8-93b9-e62ef05ebc04", "04d81b82-5101-4521-872d-6cd6d52da7d7", "0bd7b323-b8a6-4324-a5df-436dcf10804b", "0fd5aa4c-c75c-4ea0-8d7d-b3e161691e4d", "10569589-6f3f-40fe-9450-777665ac088f", "14caffec-24d3-4281-91ae-4963045e94f3", "2bfce744-47b9-4419-97bf-deb7565ec6e3", "30dc509d-e502-4e26-9942-913501b90f65", "317cbf2b-a75a-49d4-a528-438a891ecd27", "3ef1dbbf-6504-452c-bae5-d00c61d419d2", "41428b11-270e-435b-8b65-7554d9aa76d7", "46925b7f-d9a9-400a-a88d-7aa45706c725", "617723cb-ec9f-45b7-9fa7-53a5dbf5e0fa", "67a89a72-34bf-4d70-b1ab-b317a1f85050", "6e8ea39b-5d8f-43e5-9663-84abb1b52da6", "764924a9-547e-4d36-ba24-b71ea2f7439a", "78a6d91d-2b98-4464-8bea-cd034e8c7d74", "8bd64682-8e62-4368-9867-048004af85d7", "91142915-2f52-459e-842f-6f588eb1f63a", "91b41d96-f808-4716-8cff-b68ae4b9a49f", "931a1518-10de-4a85-8bc1-88ac483f5fa3", "93bc889b-63d5-4032-9c76-33f7bf2c34b3", "962c3f2a-6f26-4aff-9a8f-e4a76e1e42cc", "970d8696-d448-4cb7-bfe0-aef88871036d", "9b78b805-c36a-4b19-aace-1fa1a7695824", "9dbd0793-227e-4d0e-8dbb-7682ff9b6376", "a4f92198-9c9a-44a7-af87-d8fa19cf934c", "a95bbd91-6090-40a6-830e-50811f7e29ac", "b24cfecf-f3db-4da4-8b58-66d821ed450e", "bb9a3524-56be-4892-a1a5-284888b2b847", "c11ea1c5-ab9a-406f-bce1-02b46ee2a706", "c54d00f5-1a02-4bac-8515-95ea3b055e2c", "d08bf291-b47e-401f-bbf3-75c016ab30ef", "d2ce828d-b33f-4f6d-9765-0eebf7fa0189", "d5a730d1-2b10-4434-a00f-a1a99df4c72d", "d8ab6b10-bed8-4f5d-8a4c-21a3432797a9", "ecd6a845-8439-49b0-abe8-f71fff81da23", "f4f043b0-785a-468d-be04-28d7857446e8"], "title": "Empirically detecting false test alarms using association rules", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "58f3e4e0-59de-4f38-b9b2-05236036219c"}
{"abstract": "This paper characterizes operational failures of a production Custom Package Good Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) platform. Events log collected over 283 days of in-field operation are used to characterize platform failures. The characterization is performed by estimating (i) common failure types of the platform, (ii) key factors impacting platform failures, (iii) failure rate, and (iv) how user workload (files submitted for processing) impacts on the failure rate. The major findings are: (i) 34.1% of failures are caused by unexpected values in customers' data, (ii) nearly 33% of the failures are because of timeout, and (iii) the failure rate increases if the workload intensity (transactions/second) increases, while there is no statistical evidence of being influenced by the workload volume (size of users' data).

We are taking Indian classical dance `Odissi' as the input. The twenty videos `Chowkh' and `Tribhangi' of `Odissi' dance have been recognized using Kinect sensor, which is used for visual sensing. With the help of Kinect, we obtain a set of twenty body junction coordinates out of which only sixteen are required for our proposed work. A unique and simple methodology has been adopted to distinguish between the postures based on the distance and angle between the different joint coordinates. The average joint information values from each hand and leg are processed and they form the four vertices of a 4-sided polygon. The value of the four edges and four angles are to obtain from the polygon to train SVM.

With the help of this algorithm, the de-noised image is obtained by merging two intermediate images of the same. In this framework, the input noise image is simultaneously fed into gaussian filter and curvelet transform. The first output image is obtained by filtering the image with Gaussian. The second output image is obtained by denoising it with curvelet transform. Experimental results show that the PSNR and MSE ratio is substantially improved by the proposed method.

{"abstract": "Being able to automatically repair programs is at the same time a very compelling vision and an extremely challenging task. In this paper, we present MintHint, a novel technique for program repair that is a departure from most of today\u2019s approaches. Instead of trying to fully automate program repair, which is often an unachievable goal, MintHint performs statistical correlation analysis to identify expressions that are likely to occur in the repaired code and generates, using pattern-matching based synthesis, repair hints from these expressions. Intuitively, these hints suggest how to rectify a faulty statement and help developers find a complete, actual repair.     We also present an empirical evaluation of MintHint in two parts. The first part is a user study that shows that, when debugging, developers\u2019 productivity improved manyfold with the use of repair hints\u2014instead of traditional fault localization information alone. The second part consists of applying MintHint to several faults in Unix utilities to further assess the effectiveness of the approach. Our results show that MintHint performs well even in common situations where (1) the repair space searched does not contain the exact repair, and (2) the operational specification obtained from the test cases for repair is incomplete or even imprecise, which can be challenging for approaches aiming at fully automated repair.", "authors": ["Shalini Kaleeswaran", "Varun Tulsian", "Aditya Kanade", "Alessandro Orso"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["009a354b-4bc2-4049-a149-3195cd357bee", "0e45f88a-91b4-412d-96bb-96aa7f21e89b", "0ed73fc7-0a43-4035-baeb-2ae130c184d5", "1ccea4c0-d409-4d93-9dd0-ff56f7cf4dfa", "2268d4cf-b284-4e25-9a80-b92dc52daa19", "2f06d551-30fc-4ee9-8768-ddb494cd59fb", "3de3422e-5e55-430b-8986-22385e4ad6ec", "40ccf842-83c7-4a74-ae2f-28173b06477b", "41541aed-a11d-487f-a124-12117ed6facb", "65d031b9-2a84-43d9-a23a-300bcccad40d", "69958fd7-7886-4fa4-9ae7-3f08ee3d08a8", "6c53d105-48f2-4ebe-b2eb-406dacc99be1", "71b90a90-d12d-4c30-984b-7ede24999b0a", "71c47dd0-a7ff-4b97-a640-1186dd9ac968", "7b433970-2d8b-45dc-86ab-6b990511c3af", "7d14325f-13e7-4708-94c3-69eab53e2058", "82a1eadd-c3c9-4a65-854a-1d0e4c52c2d4", "831a2993-87d8-4360-ae18-4fd1bfbc966c", "8ce6d2da-e4ff-4b1d-abc3-a61e2cbf6ce1", "92490cb9-dc24-442a-878a-cfdc0aa0bef9", "9605cfe5-3c12-4020-825e-d265af17b219", "9fd310d2-e15e-4573-bcfe-69bdbca70ca5", "a6260ebd-32cc-4509-bdc2-91f35d607a72", "b30aaca8-d1eb-4f4a-bc77-047526e5570c", "b5cd27d3-474a-471c-b416-8b57dda451b2", "ba94e505-b3d2-4f2c-9318-7d26034c8e25", "c19af853-b651-432d-ba74-b63ac7bb0880", "c27d9399-f699-4c9f-a22d-6c7dd7548ccc", "c67ff68d-6523-4058-af5b-445bd21dbbb3", "c971d5ae-f1ce-40b8-b015-d2e8533d5238", "c9cd1803-6539-4768-9315-7b07c40701d8", "cacad24f-495a-44dd-9392-bf586c1686bb", "cb7365af-cfd7-4e0c-a22b-806ea5db3dc1", "d32cfe6e-8c57-4172-84f4-17eb9b0bdfde", "d7dd4fba-1c98-47f4-a4ff-97ccc14aae67", "ddc4dea3-a9f4-4a19-9e43-d28977f675ac", "eafe671d-f6eb-4a21-be0d-b7e697e04d70"], "title": "MintHint: automated synthesis of repair hints", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "59380ead-deb8-4850-b093-80985757000f"}

This dissertation provides suggestions to enhance contributors' performance and participation intentions to help improve project performance. To do so, we mine historical data in software repositories from a two-pronged approach: 1) To assess contributors' performance to identify strengths and areas of improvement. 2) To measure the influence of factors on contributors' participation and performance, and provide suggestions that help advance contributor's engagement. The methodology used in this study leverage empirical techniques, both quantitative and qualitative, to conduct the analysis. We believe that the insights presented here will help contributors improve their performance. Also, we expect managers and business analysts to benefit from the suggestions to revise factors that negatively influence contributors' engagement and hence improve project performance.", "authors": ["Ayushi Rastogi"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["023338b5-6441-4b2c-88ce-15fc011c3fce", "0331f459-20b4-479a-a137-0c4b9e5cc973", "040a4856-25ea-4a3a-abd4-0ba13ffb0272", "04d502d0-4233-431f-a36d-37bca620576a", "0b37a39f-3afd-44f8-97ae-0d160b80e00b", "11c7aafd-b0ba-4b41-a093-662b76d7f3a1", "16d4cf84-0a02-4d36-9449-3baa4bb861c5", "269223b9-32c2-47c6-a883-92bd453d7f0d", "26d65c60-dbb8-4445-b091-f224ca0c0d12", "3639c242-f03d-4c1a-a9e1-20c2d929d284", "37f52436-0c3a-4ead-aca2-a365b88ada4a", "44df8b4a-8569-4952-b6c4-6a08671ced62", "5391ac02-0695-473e-819a-5e93d4adf81d", "53caa174-bc03-4e10-a988-385b86af2887", "5a7c4e7b-88b0-4c32-bd27-e28616260e25", "69ac69d0-b5f5-4291-bee7-2b28f56793a9", "69d6f732-3749-407d-be44-5c1d0d9e9255", "753aca71-0ad0-471e-9940-e5ce83f8623b", "75a7746c-cdac-4252-9fa5-95effafc9e8f", "91660cb1-3f46-4609-9249-9e9ddc4cca6a", "985aacc0-9856-4e00-acf9-15ad431f3b00", "9b80f1aa-8f43-4bfa-bdd9-f2acd8b240f6", "a1217df6-11d0-47a7-b2be-df3634454c65", "b2b6d49f-acba-4285-b550-58a35f0dc301", "e0eb5547-6f36-499f-88f6-084de037bee6", "f2e604b7-394c-4420-94e4-bba825048b53"], "title": "Contributor's performance, participation intentions, its influencers and project performance", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "5957de56-4201-4436-9a92-9f6f5efcc72d"}

{"abstract": "Data flow testing has recently attracted new interest in the context of testing object oriented systems, since data flow information is well suited to capture relations among the object states, and can thus provide useful information for testing method interactions. Unfortunately, classic data flow testing, which is based on static analysis of the source code, fails to identify many important data flow relations due to the dynamic nature of object oriented systems. In this paper, we propose a new technique to generate test cases for object oriented software. The technique exploits useful inter-procedural data flow information extracted dynamically from execution traces for object oriented systems. The technique is designed to enhance an initial test suite with test cases that exercise complex state based method interactions. The experimental results indicate that dynamic data flow testing can indeed generate test cases that exercise relevant behaviors otherwise missed by both the original test suite and by test suites that satisfy classic data flow criteria.", "authors": ["Giovanni Denaro", "Alessandro Margara", "Mauro Pezz\u00e8", "Mattia Vivanti"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0315ca50-80d7-4cc9-b841-b84e58cfea13", "0553e9aa-6747-4546-91eb-2fa84865afd8", "05dd259f-bc12-4b6f-8290-49f9edc589a2", "0d89ee51-90ff-4653-a547-adfd849d18d4", "0fd5aa4c-c75c-4ea0-8d7d-b3e161691e4d", "14ae4a8d-b999-4811-ab63-dda1b1d988ec", "1c4560dd-f4d4-4203-bd41-60c687ec7e8c", "226623fc-2ec0-44d7-9d48-f0469e821405", "22fc1b74-f122-46b8-a795-8d361d2db914", "25f1895f-eec4-4374-9c95-d7a39ecdedb9", "260f7820-2e0a-469c-95a6-352e75a2f337", "2872c6e4-a55c-4248-aec6-ffb53f2e0884", "289715ea-8659-42d2-9c8d-b97e683beb2b", "2ac5fedd-db52-4207-ac12-b527da60b604", "301660c6-cf2f-49c5-9326-f786985a0608", "30505a63-6a9b-4614-aacf-5d7531eca52e", "31e14350-9e7e-4fa9-8baf-d6a994a96dae", "3758cfd3-036f-433e-a41d-3622efab8acc", "4056eb66-b7f6-49c0-b945-3a8ad61f300e", "405d3a13-883a-4510-a25f-7aaf6b5d6d36", "43a55524-a6d3-4a18-8dce-651e05400836", "48df77c7-2fd3-4cd2-979f-073d858808c9", "548e83af-c311-4260-a904-cbcf275bda94", "57071747-069e-453f-b3e1-b16b417581ee", "57e46d47-fa8e-4721-b6a4-2109c8db8bb8", "5edf8e80-e11f-4ddc-8051-23ec0b49c6a9", "5fcfd132-e4b8-40cf-8447-db956065c4c7", "6212ecfe-ecfd-4f70-98b4-877f691a3d58", "67261b29-e58a-4fb0-b040-f9451f2e7fbb", "694bb25e-d8ff-40f0-8035-ec7a5e364fdc", "6fbd6e3c-ffdc-4c45-81ef-bc3c2e984baa", "75464f7f-9d02-462a-8432-2465ae88f165", "76cea084-096f-476c-a922-4f6a0b22bec0", "7dfa1a13-2705-42bc-98fa-25aba83dd943", "7fda2ad5-4685-4a4e-8685-356729cbcc33", "86489724-282a-4483-80dc-df28dcaac4b7", "86a4f226-1269-41f2-bd88-6afb2edc4322", "8ebef7f5-66aa-4928-ac67-67d8c24d4a9c", "98e22ff9-3d7f-4377-be70-a0c5861d7346", "9bcdd744-408b-4988-8624-f037094f3f2c", "9e3ecf6e-36fe-44c4-ac6a-17c96567bb9d", "aa9805b3-4f30-46ae-af5b-a2cf2e915265", "adae4167-6e4a-47d0-bda0-f7090a978ece", "b907e617-621e-42f5-a357-1c67424a3cd0", "c0fb3182-6b58-4c26-b00a-fd6f2d5e9b4d", "c2a8cca5-546a-4545-be8d-c90d95b7d26b", "c5198771-9eeb-42bf-be33-a16d50ba4088", "c7e5b54c-b2bf-4c90-bd04-c7371591b113", "cbbb351e-3ce9-4ef3-8186-c7d1e05a8108", "d7697789-ce49-4c0c-b5dc-74c0456544cc", "de0526f8-c7a6-4134-9b60-5d76d46e080e", "df135521-980f-40e2-b167-c3dfa416249d", "e24dc65e-5d0f-4bde-abe4-2bc79c97e1ad", "e631fc24-d799-4379-8da8-25a2f5dd684f", "e901df8f-902d-474c-983e-385e908889b4", "f0b82d3f-379b-4504-a2e5-449f5852d8b0", "ff3ffbff-fab3-4f94-bf86-c1c7b67c448d", "ffdd91d8-218e-43b7-8569-4c6618ddcca3"], "title": "Dynamic data flow testing of object oriented systems", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "59690d45-9c10-44fd-a678-fbdb6ba204fe"}
{"abstract": "Software product line (SPL) is a technology aimed at speeding up the development process. Although SPLs are widely used, their maintenance is a challenging task. In particular, when maintaining a SPL feature, developers need to know which parts of other dependent features might be affected by this maintenance. Otherwise, further maintenance problems can be introduced in the SPL implementation. However, the identification and understanding of the so-called feature dependencies in the source code are an exhaustive and error-prone task. In fact, developers often ignore unconsciously feature dependencies while reasoning about SPL maintenance. To overcome this problem, this PhD research aims at understanding the properties of feature dependencies in the source code that exert impact on SPL maintenance. Furthermore, we propose a way to structure and segregate feature interfaces in order to help developers to identify and understand feature dependencies, thus reducing the effort and avoiding undesirable side effects in SPL maintenance.", "authors": ["Bruno Barbieri Pontes Cafeo"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["2c08d317-3848-40af-9dfa-20c8ce584ce9", "510433e6-9947-4757-b8f4-dde66b4860f6", "69e3c500-3e99-44cb-810e-ffcb6bc3971d", "716c4c99-1cb5-47bf-8c09-9bd5df7a5c90", "a944cc73-f4fd-4894-96f2-435537a56583", "c2a3c0c7-04b3-44d3-9651-c711d4079744", "d32786fc-ea8d-41f0-a803-5d00e550329c", "dd4c0a6f-fbc3-4d5d-b8ac-e843ba39e381", "dd676fcc-16b4-4077-bfca-6fb5573008b2", "f3523944-482b-44c2-9036-057668aa5c05", "f829fc24-be4d-499b-b37a-e4bd76d388ee"], "title": "Enhancing feature interfaces for supporting software product line maintenance", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "596d0272-3d79-4d3b-8d5e-0692257bab6d"}

{"abstract": "A study is presented of some of the system implications of memory hierarchies in which the backing or secondary store has a very small read time, relative to both the time required for writing and to the read time of conventional backing storage devices. Several analytic models are introduced, and it is shown that such hierarchies may operate in ways which differ from those of more conventional hierarchies. In particular, it is shown that it may not be necessary to multiprogram in such a situation.  In the past, backing storage devices have been roughly symmetric with respect to their read and write times. This situation may not continue, as several devices are currently under development which may have a very small read-time/write-time ratio.

Real option thinking seems to be suitable in supporting the client\u2019s decision making process at inter-iteration time. This paper investigates the fit between real option thinking and agile requirements engineering. We first look into previously published experiences in the agile software engineering literature to identify (i) \u2018experience clusters\u2019 suggesting the ways in which real option concepts fit into the agile requirements process and (ii) \u2018experience gaps\u2019 and under-researched agile requirements decision-making topics which require further empirical studies. Furthermore, we conducted a cross-case study in eight agile development organizations and interviewed 11 practitioners about their decision-making process.

This method employs symbolic evaluation techniques to partition the set of input data into procedure subdomains so that the elements of each subdomain are treated uniformly by the specification and processed uniformly by the implementation. The partition divides the procedure domain into more manageable units. Information related to each subdomain is used to guide in the selection of test data and to verify consistency between the specification and the implementation. Moreover, the test data selection process, called partition analysis testing, and the verification process, called partition analysis verification, are used to enhance each other, and thus increase program reliability.", "authors": ["Debra J.

Other features are available through a uniform command set which itself can be augmented by the user.  The machine, although small, aids program design by providing display scope and premarked randomly addressable LINC tapes as standard items, in an environment similar to that of a sophisticated terminal. The tapes are logically similar to a disk. Priority was given to the design of efficient tape algorithms to minimize the limitations of the small memory. Techniques developed for handling scroll editing, filing, and the layered system structure are outlined.  LAP6 is used by about 2000 people in 11 countries.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we introduce the split-path nonlinear integrator (SPANI) as a novel nonlinear filter designed to improve the transient performance of linear systems in terms of overshoot. In particular, this nonlinear controller targets the well-known trade-off induced by integral action, which removes steady-state errors due to constant external disturbances, but deteriorates transient performance in terms of increased over- shoot. The rationale behind the proposed SPANI filter is to ensure that the integral action has, at all times, the same sign as the closed-loop error signal, which, as we will show, enables a reduction in overshoot (i.e., improves transient performance). The resulting closed-loop dynamics can be described by a continuous-time switched dynamical system, for which we will provide sufficient conditions for stability.

{"abstract": "Many existing enterprise applications are at a mature stage in their development and are unable to easily benefit from the usability gains offered by adaptive user interfaces (UIs). Therefore, a method is needed for integrating adaptive UI capabilities into these systems without incurring a high cost or significantly disrupting the way they function. This paper presents a method for integrating adaptive UI behavior in enterprise applications based on CEDAR, a model-driven, service-oriented, and tool-supported architecture for devising adaptive enterprise application UIs. The proposed integration method is evaluated with a case study, which includes establishing and applying technical metrics to measure several of the method\u2019s properties using the open-source enterprise application OFBiz as a test-case. The generality and flexibility of the integration method are also evaluated based on an interview and discussions with practitioners about their real-life projects.", "authors": ["Pierre A.

{"abstract": "Repetitive Control (RC) is a popular technique for tracking periodic signals and rejecting periodic disturbances. Repetitive control achieves accurate tracking of periodic tra- jectories by incorporating a periodic signal generator within the feedback loop. The periodic signal generator provides an infinite loop-gain at the harmonic frequencies of the reference signal. However, this scheme cannot be used in isolation due to challenges with stability and robustness. The stability and ro- bustness can be improved by incorporating appropriate filters. However, there is a trade-off between robustness and tracking performance. The current state-of-the art is to implement plant inversion and include phase compensators to improve the high- frequency tracking performance. In this work, a RC controller is combined with a non-causal FIR filter to improve the tracking performance without the requirement for phase compensators or plant inversion. The performance of the proposed RC design is demonstrated on a piezoelectric positioner.", "authors": ["Yik Ren Teo", "Andrew J.

It unifies algebraic specifications of abstract data types with high-level Petri net specifications of nonsequential systems in a common syntactic and semantic framework. The data structure of a system, the information content of its local states, and static constraints to state changes are specified algebraically using positive conditional equations. Dynamic behavior is specified by high level Petri nets. Each net defines a (distributed) initial state and a partial ordering in which state changing operations may happen.  SEGRAS  addresses advanced programming methodologies by offering facilities for modularization and parameterization, and a type system which supports polymorphism with dependent types, higher-order types, subtypes, and overloading.

{"abstract": "Previous applications of symbolic execution (SymExe) have focused on bug-finding and test-case generation. However, SymExe has the potential to significantly improve usability and automation when applied to verification of software contracts in safety-critical systems. Due to the lack of support for processing software contracts and ad hoc approaches for introducing a variety of over/under-approximations and optimizations, most SymExe implementations cannot precisely characterize the verification status of contracts. Moreover, these tools do not provide explicit justifications for their conclusions, and thus they are not aligned with trends toward evidence-based verification and certification. We introduce the concept of \"explicating symbolic execution\" (xSymExe) that builds on a strong semantic foundation, supports full verification of rich software contracts, explicitly tracks where over/under-approximations are introduced or avoided, precisely characterizes the verification status of each contractual claim, and associates each claim with \"explications\" for its reported verification status.

Our proposed approach constructs a continuous piecewise affine (CPA) function given a suitable partition of the state space, called a triangulation, and values at the vertices of the triangulation. The vertex values are obtained from a Lyapunov function in a classical converse Lyapunov theorem and verification that the obtained CPA function is a Lyapunov function is shown to be equivalent to verification of several simple inequalities. Furthermore, by refining the triangulation, we show that it is always possible to construct a CPA Lyapunov function.

{"abstract": "Software engineering education is a technologically challenging, rapidly evolving discipline. Like all STEM educators, software engineering educators are bombarded with a constant stream of new tools and techniques (MOOCs! Active learning! Inverted classrooms!) while under national pressure to produce outstanding STEM graduates. Software engineering educators are also pressured on the discipline side; a constant evolution of technology coupled with a still emerging engineering discipline. As a handson engineering discipline, where engineers not only design but also construct the technology, guidance on the adoption of project-centric curricula is needed. This paper focuses on vertical integration of project experiences in undergraduate software engineering degree programs or course sequences. The Software Enterprise, now in its 9 th  year, has grown from an upper-division course sequence to a vertical integration program feature. The Software Enterprise is presented as an implementation of a project spine curricular pattern, and a plan for maturing this model is given.", "authors": ["Kevin Gary", "Timothy E.

People, on the other hand, have a wide range of ideas, beliefs and objectives. How does one reconcile the two? Otherwise put: how do work practices and ethics that are important from an organizational standpoint get inculcated in employees? We propose a Human Behavior Change model and apply it to the context of ethics spread in software organizations. The model is founded upon an internal cost-reward function of individuals and transmission effect between people that contributes to the decision to change and comply with certain ethics and practices. We use Agent Based Modeling and Simulation (ABMS) technique to represent our model. We experiment with virtual teams and create various scenarios to understand ethic spread. Although our larger aim is to model behavior change, in this early stage of our work, we build models to know how ethics spread through change in compliance behavior. We base our study on existing literature, a limited survey, some assumptions and simulation. Through simulation, we also seek to ask associated questions related to team size and compliance, spread of counter-ethics, message mechanism and speed of spread and the \u2018mean time to change\u2019 for different types of individuals.", "authors": ["Sandeep Athavale", "Meghendra Singh"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["2e9801ad-2022-4186-abd4-d09c225dc3a4"], "title": "Modeling work-ethics spread in software organizations", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "5bb61393-99fd-426f-b002-59f7f01660e4"}

We show here that elements of the syntactic semiring of  L  can be identified with transformations of a certain modification of the minimal automaton for  L .   The main issue here are the inequalities  r ( x  1 , ...,  x m  ) \u2286  L  and equations  r ( x  1 , ...,  x m  ) =  L  where  L  is a given regular language over a finite alphabet  A  and  r  is a given regular expression over  A  in variables  x  1 , ...,  x m  . We show that the search for maximal solutions can be translated into the (finite) syntactic semiring of the language  L . In such a way we are able to decide the solvability and to find all maximal solutions effectively. In fact, the last questions were already solved by Conway using his factors.

{"abstract": "A study is made of the way in which asynchronous time division multiplexing changes the stochastic nature of the arrival process from a user to the computer and, consequently, affects the performance of a time-shared computer-communications system. It is concluded that while, for certain values of system parameters, there is noticeable improvement in the performance of the computer (model), in the sense that time-shared scheduling delays are reduced, these improvements are offset by the transmission delays imposed by multiplexing so that there may be little or no change in the computer-communications system performance.  Analytical and simulation results are based on the model of the computer-communications system being an M/D/1 queue (the multiplexor) in tandem with a single exponential server (the computer).

{"abstract": "Software engineers generate vast quantities of development artifacts such as source code, bug reports, test cases, usage logs, etc., as they create and maintain their projects. The information contained in these artifacts could provide valuable insights into the software quality and adoption, as well as development process. However, very little of it is available in the way that is immediately useful to various stakeholders. This research aims to extract and analyze data from software repositories to provide software practitioners with up-to-date and insightful information that can support informed decisions related to the business, management, design, or development of software systems. This data-centric decision-making is known as analytics. In particular, we demonstrate that by employing software development analytics, we can help developers make informed decisions around user adoption of a software project, code review process, as well as improve developers' awareness of their working context.", "authors": ["Olga Baysal"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1b741d97-bd1b-4ac9-abd7-2cbb1d475cf9", "268e5152-e432-40ae-aec7-639668ca9446", "2710ef00-fe7b-4518-a978-a064fe559cc5", "420c8cbd-30fb-4c44-a854-c2949db459e0", "4b81405a-2392-4939-bc38-462323c26434", "56941878-4354-4039-8b03-b8aa8cbfa6f6", "5ed0c7ab-6793-48d4-a3f4-ff5b8a299b64", "771444e0-49d2-4865-af3a-052960150545", "7dfb7ff8-cc97-4852-81cb-434061c08bdd", "7eb9832b-5093-4e29-baa0-a50e825bd24f", "8bdc6949-c22a-4625-87b2-66d3b73f34af", "9ffd7d1d-8698-4c44-bb3b-6df58425c086", "a7dfded5-1d25-49f8-a3e9-e7c3402f5ff5", "b7fbac9b-b404-4589-89bd-d4e2c863abd4", "c5612009-b239-4096-8e64-261c04e6cefa", "d8ab6b10-bed8-4f5d-8a4c-21a3432797a9", "d8fac157-07e5-4bfe-a6b5-b8d8eb418446", "e0783c00-90b9-4849-a650-114ffb62cf17", "e44f1a75-ef45-48a1-875e-1b40b0e09b94", "e84383fe-2688-4257-a744-f3ce6ae7b514", "eab9f6b0-282e-40a3-8ee6-c140b55adefd", "eabb8559-ae8f-420a-91e8-5d9a7f574c9f", "f75776ac-50d6-4e26-9eca-71b8615c7521"], "title": "Informing development decisions: from data to information", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "5c259d0a-1b32-43dc-89fe-d8d57a486513"}

We focus on a scheduling problem for autonomous micro-ferries, where the task of assigning transportation requests to specific micro-ferries and determining the order of handling them is done centrally. The method is based on the travelling salesman problem and vehicle routing problem with time-windows, but differs in the inclusion of constraints on the energy-consumption and an increased flexibility in travel times, which are both influenced by varying the speed of the micro-ferries. This results in a mixed-integer non-linear programming problem, which can be transformed into a mixed-integer linear programming problem by using an approximation of the speed variables.", "authors": ["M.

The emerging IoT that offers ubiquitous sensing and actuation can be utilized effectively for managing urban environments.

{"abstract": "Developing security-critical systems is difficult and there are many well-known examples of security weaknesses exploited in practice. Thus a sound methodology supporting secure systems development is urgently needed. We present an extensible verification framework for verifying UML models for security requirements. In particular, it includes various plugins performing different security analyses on models of the security extension UMLsec of UML. Here, we concentrate on an automated theorem prover binding to verify security properties of UMLsec models which make use of cryptography (such as cryptographic protocols). The paper aims to contribute towards usage of UML for secure systems development in practice by offering automated analysis routines connected to popular CASE tools.

{"abstract": "A classical problem in computational geometry is the planar point location problem. This problem calls for preprocessing a polygonal subdivision of the plane defined by n line segments so that, given a sequence of points, the polygon containing each point can be determined quickly on-line. Several ways of solving this problem in O(log n) query time and O(n) space are known, but they are all rather complicated. We propose a simple O(log n)-query-time, O(n)-space solution, using persistent search trees. A persistent search tree differs from an ordinary search tree in that after an insertion or deletion, the old version of the tree can still be accessed. We develop a persistent form of binary search tree that supports insertions and deletions in the present and queries in the past. The time per query or update is O(log m), where m is the total number of updates, and the space needed is O(1) per update. Our planar point location algorithm is an immediate application of this data structure. The structure also provides an alternative to Chazelle's \"hive graph\" structure, which has a variety of applications in geometric retrieval.", "authors": ["Neil Sarnak", "Robert Endre Tarjan"], "n_citation": 419, "references": ["0958dab9-c66f-43f3-a5d1-3ca103c513dd", "1090e21f-6a30-4529-beec-fe27776090ce", "4f441b8f-ab67-4e5e-9f77-fc71c0dfd378", "5978ea4a-3138-4f8e-8955-1b8bea9553e1", "5b12bba5-64df-4ccb-810f-87214edbd243", "5de1d7e1-5fcd-478b-b436-4716812d40f1", "6867a27b-4b3c-4bfc-8dd1-286630cb69cd", "68de575c-0de0-4c13-8e02-e563d3346b94", "70a4fa95-e960-4c72-8db0-557d7defa300", "73062e15-33c4-4258-8815-47a35c352994", "7975b0ed-32e7-4b58-9677-6bc083057435", "7998bf6e-40e2-4d8a-bfb5-954fa7e64eb6", "7f165cd7-6bae-4714-ba61-1b56ad696e7d", "a662a4e7-415e-417e-8a8f-fe085d7e487f", "bb4aaf35-bea4-49c4-9b5b-ca54c0749337", "ca96ed0d-75a0-4f09-ac06-26675a6fdbb0", "cb441602-7d3b-46fb-a29b-741c0b2d86f0", "cdee9e51-133c-45e9-9ae5-daf62d6921cf", "d0ff5377-1c0d-4a5c-af06-d3e5a0dd42d4", "dc5398c1-f11a-4d07-b190-455087b27be8", "fe4e9464-e385-4bd8-bb45-84372d2dddec"], "title": "Planar point location using persistent search trees", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 1986, "id": "5ca6988f-8bec-4bb7-a320-a68604ba653c"}

{"abstract": "The capability maturity model (CMM) for software has become very influential as a basis for software process improvement (SPI). Most of the evidence to date showing the results of these efforts has consisted of case studies. We present a systematic survey of organizations that have undertaken CMM-based SPI to get more representative results. We found evidence that process maturity is in fact associated with better organizational performance, and that software process appraisals are viewed, in retrospect, as extremely valuable and accurate guides for the improvement effort. The path was not always smooth, however, and efforts generally took longer and cost more than expected. A number of factors that distinguished highly successful from unsuccessful efforts are identified. Most of these factors are under management control, suggesting that a number of specific management decisions are likely to have a major impact on the success of the effort.", "authors": ["James D.

{"abstract": "In sensor fusion scheme, measurements from multiple sensors usually arrive at different rate, and out-of-sequence which are called out-of-sequence measurements (OOSMs). To observe the state of a system using the information from OOSMs, the covariance of the process noise accumulated from time to time is necessary. However, by assuming that all noises are Gaussian in Kalman filter, it is difficult to determine the covariance of the accumulated process noise from a system that is described by a continuous-time nonlinear model. This paper introduces an integration method to estimate the state, the state covariance and the covariance of the accumulated process noise from a continuous-time nonlinear model. Together with an OOSM update algorithm using Ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), we can realize an OOSM filter for most nonlinear systems efficiently. The algorithm requires low number of particles, derivative-free, without a necessity of finding backward transition function for the system.", "authors": ["Sirichai Pornsarayouth", "Masaki Yamakita"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["160e63a3-f117-4247-bb0d-3ccc75f7b47d", "5f7bfc19-f291-46cf-b92c-d9d05228783f", "7aefad46-acb7-4dd5-8db4-769339fcd44d", "84c13738-cbbb-4f2c-abb8-5944b6ed065f", "9002aabe-4f94-422b-ba2e-7e79a2bccbf0", "a494fc16-91db-4828-bf76-5649111da7c0"], "title": "Ensemble Kalman filtering of out-of-sequence measurements for continuous-time model", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "5d6db133-0fbd-4814-b525-777b00457fab"}

{"abstract": "Placement of names on a dense map is a complex and difficult process to automate. Maps consist of features represented by points, lines, and areas. On dense maps, features are closely spaced, leaving little room for names or labels. Names must be placed so they do not overlap each other or conceal existing features. The placements should contribute to the aesthetic quality of the map.#R##N#To demonstrate name-placement techniques on dense maps, a fully automated cartography system was developed. This system automatically creates digital map databases, places names, and produces high-quality human-readable maps. It uses sets of rules to define how maps are to be labelled and plotted. A single map database may be used to produce different kinds of maps of the same region. Features may be labelled and represented differently on each map simply by changing the rules.#R##N#The name-placement rules determine the location, orientation, font, size, and slant of each character in the names of the features. After each rule is processed, the name-placement quality is evaluated to determine whether additional rules must be processed. If the quality of a name placement deteriorates after new names are placed, backtracking occurs and the name is repositioned. If the map is too dense, acceptable placements may not be found for all names and the placement quality degrades gracefully.#R##N#Rules in the dense-map name-placement system may place names for point features next to the points or shift them horizontally and vertically until acceptable positions are found. Line feature names may be centered on the line or offset from it. Area feature names may be placed horizontally inside a region or next to it. The names may also be placed along the skeleton or border of the region.", "authors": ["Jeffrey S.

Using  Instress  (Inscape's module interface specification language) specifications, Invariant provides a better understanding of the notion of parallel versions, a more comprehensive notion of version consistency, and a more flexible method of system composition than current mechanisms. In particular, Invariant provides a formalization of the notions of version equivalence and compatibility that correspond closely with our intuitive (and practical) notions of version equivalence and compatibility.

{"abstract": "This paper introduces an approximation algorithm for stochastic multi-agent planning based on Markov decision processes (MDPs). Specifically, we focus on a decentralized approach for planning the actions of a team of cooperating agents with uncertainties in fuel consumption and health-related models. The core idea behind the algorithm presented in this paper is to allow each agent to approximate the representation of its teammates. Each agent therefore maintains its own planner that fully enumerates its local states and actions while approximating those of its teammates. In prior work, the authors approximated each teammate individually, which resulted in a large reduction of the planning space, but remained exponential (in n \u2212 1 rather than in n, where n is the number of agents) in computational scalability. This paper extends the approach and presents a new approximation that aggregates all teammates into a single, abstracted entity. Under the persistent search & track mission scenario with 3 agents, we show that while resulting performance is decreased nearly 20% compared with the centralized optimal solution, the problem size becomes linear in n, a very attractive feature when planning online for large multi-agent teams.", "authors": ["Joshua Redding", "N.

{"abstract": "WebIDE is a framework that enables instructors to develop and deliver online lab content with interactive feedback. The ability to create lock-step labs enables the instructor to guide students through learning experiences, demonstrating mastery as they proceed. Feedback is provided through automated evaluators that vary from simple regular expression evaluation to syntactic parsers to applications that compile and run programs and unit tests. This paper describes WebIDE and its use in a CS0 course that taught introductory Java and Android programming using a test-driven learning approach. We report results from a controlled experiment that compared the use of dynamic WebIDE labs with more traditional static programming labs. Despite weaker performance on pre-study assessments, students who used WebIDE performed two to twelve percent better on all assessments than the students who used traditional labs. In addition, WebIDE students were consistently more positive about their experience in CS0.", "authors": ["David S.

{"abstract": "Static measurements of the list structure of five large Lisp programs are reported and analyzed in this paper. These measurements reveal substantial regularity, or predictability, among pointers to atoms and especially among pointers to lists. Pointers to atoms are found to obey, roughly, Zipf's law, which governs word frequencies in natural languages; pointers to lists usually point to a location physically nearby in memory. The use of such regularities in the space-efficient representation of list structure is discussed. Linearization of lists, whereby successive cdrs (or cars) are placed in consecutive memory locations whenever possible, greatly strengthens the observed regularity of list structure. It is shown that under some reasonable assumptions, the entropy or information content of a car-cdr pair in the programs measured is about 10 to 15 bits before linearization, and about 7 to 12 bits after.", "authors": ["Douglas W.

{"abstract": "The past 10 years have delivered two significant revolutions. (1) Microprocessor design has been transformed by the limits of chip power, wire latency, and Dennard scaling---leading to multicore processors and heterogeneity. (2) Managed languages and an entirely new software landscape emerged---revolutionizing how software is deployed, is sold, and interacts with hardware. Researchers most often examine these changes in isolation. Architects mostly grapple with microarchitecture design through the narrow software context of native sequential SPEC CPU benchmarks, while language researchers mostly consider microarchitecture in terms of performance alone. This work explores the clash of these two revolutions over the past decade by measuring power, performance, energy, and scaling, and considers what the results may mean for the future. Our diverse findings include the following: (a) native sequential workloads do not approximate managed workloads or even native parallel workloads; (b) diverse application power profiles suggest that future applications and system software will need to participate in power optimization and management; and (c) software and hardware researchers need access to real measurements to optimize for power and energy.", "authors": ["Hadi Esmaeilzadeh", "Ting Cao", "Xi Yang", "Stephen M.

{"abstract": "This paper explores a technique for proving the correctness and termination of programs simultaneously. This approach, the  intermittent-assertion method , involves documenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control passes through the corresponding point, but that need not be true every time. The method, introduced by Burstall, promises to provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods.  The intermittent-assertion method is presented with a number of examples of correctness and termination proofs. Some of these proofs are markedly simpler than their conventional counterparts. On the other hand, it is shown that a proof of correctness or termination by any of the conventional techniques can be rephrased directly as a proof using intermittent assertions. Finally, it is shown how the intermittent-assertion method can be applied to prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs.", "authors": ["Zohar Manna", "Richard J.

{"abstract": "Ten years ago, our paper described how a very small system might be developed to control a coin-operated turnstile in a zoo [1]. It arose out of our efforts to understand how requirements, domain knowledge and specifications fit together, and how specifications could be derived systematically. A particular goal was to understand requirements and specifications for telecommunication systems well enough to handle the feature interaction problem that plagues telecommunication software.A year later we published a more comprehensive version of our requirements framework [3], and began to develop the Distributed Feature Composition (DFC) architecture for telecommunication services [2]. We continued to work on it together until mid-2002. DFC has proven successful in practice, and is now being used in a commercial voice-over-IP service.Since publishing the requirements framework, we have worked on different kinds of system, and have been confronted with important differences in how its principles apply. It has taken all this time to achieve the goal of understanding requirements for telecommunication services and other connection services. In this domain, requirements are heavily influenced by the fact that services are assemblies of components added to a basic network infrastructure. Our work in another direction has led to a focus on system interaction with the human and physical world, recognising the varying roles of formalisation and formal reasoning in problems of different kinds, and the need for a stronger grip on the relationship between engineering of software and engineering in the world.The common lesson of these experiences is that the requirements framework of ten years ago is a good generalization, but specific domains and situations require their own specializations of it.", "authors": ["Michael Jackson", "Pamela Zave"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["2358e0a5-b32c-4f15-b81c-01456e034647", "3b8d8731-2b70-4454-a354-6ed9485098e2", "cc53b410-e440-43f3-92fe-10cb41f70756"], "title": "Where do you go when you're through the turnstile?", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2005, "id": "5ee45634-4688-46ac-8fd8-4f91ef9e9cc2"}

Such processes appeared to be quite dependent on the computer used, and so it was difficult to obtain agreement on those matters.

However, the existing implementations have taken many different approaches to the subject, and this has hampered the interchange of programs between installations.

In this paper we report data from interviews with software architects about how practitioners utilize architecture during system evolution.

The key gap we observe is in correct and timely communication of architectural issues. This overall finding is not surprising. However, our data also contributes to how architecture knowledge management activities can be focused for most benefit throughout a system's lifespan.

{"abstract": "Abstract \u0097The wind farm micro-siting is an important s-trategy for reducing the cost of wind energy. In this paper,two different types of wind turbines are considered for a windfarm to take the full advantage of wind resources at differentaltitudes. The phenotype of the problem is described by aninteger encoding method, and a repair operator of geneticalgorithm is proposed to handle the position constraint. Theoptimal objective is to maximize the net present value of awind farm under a certain initial budget. Simulation resultsdemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm andthe signicance of planting multi-type wind turbines. I. INTRODUCTIONNowadays, wind energy has received increasing attentiondue to its availability, low cost and environment-friendlyoperation. Wind energy has superior advantages over con-ventional energy resources. For one thing the graduallydiminishing fossil fuel resources have caused adverse effectson the environment, and for another wind resources areinexhaustible and emission-free. According to the data in [1],worldwide nameplate capacity of wind-powered generatorswas 282,482 megawatts at the end of 2012, growing by 44gigawatts over the preceding year. Moreover, wind energyhas been widely developed in Europe, Asia, and the UnitedStates.The wind farm micro-siting, which is an approach foroptimizing the layout of wind turbines in a wind farm, isone of the most effective strategies for reducing the costof wind energy and pursuing greater economic prots. Afew algorithms were proposed for the wind turbine lay-out optimization, among which the evolutionary algorithmswere frequently adopted. Mosetti et al. [2] rst utilizedthe binary-coded genetic algorithm to optimize the windturbine placement by extracting the maximum energy for theminimum installation costs, and their study were revised byGrady et al. [3] for better results. Mora et al. [4] introducedthe net present value (NPV) to calculate the revenue of awind farm instead of the traditional cost model. Wan etal. [5] improved the wind and turbine models, and Emamiet al. [6] proposed the matrix chromosome to improve theoptimization algorithm. Empirically, a cluster of turbinesshould be placed apart with a distance of more than threetimes that of a rotor diameter to reduce the wake losses [7].The common way to deal with this problem is to divide thewind farm into nite uniform square grids, which turns theconstrained problem into an unconstrained one.", "authors": ["Bin Duan", "Jun Wang", "Huajie Gu"], "n_citation": 8, "references": ["b6f5d18c-8dda-4e3b-a92f-86274bf76bcf"], "title": "Modified genetic algorithm for layout optimization of multi-type wind turbines", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2014, "id": "5f5cc408-09f3-45a2-861e-26f971296a24"}

The SLAM problem is first formulated in a sensor-based framework, without any type of vehicle pose information, and modified in such a way that the underlying system structure can be regarded as linear time varying for observability, filter design, and convergence analysis purposes. Thus, a Kalman filter follows naturally with GAS error dynamics that estimates, in a robocentric coordinate frame, the positions of the landmarks, the velocity of the vehicle, and the bias of the angular velocity measurement. The online inertial map and trajectory estimation is detailed in a companion paper and follows from the estimation solution provided by the SLAM filter herein presented.

{"abstract": "The effect of flutter phenomenon on dynamic stability of aeroelastic systems is a main interest of recent studies. Among many approaches for suppression of flutter, in this paper two control strategies are introduced and their results are compared. State-Dependent Riccati Equation (SDRE) approach and Sliding Mode Control (SMC) approach are used for stabilization of an Aeroservoelastic system with structural nonlinearities at subsonic flight speed regime. These two control techniques suppress flutter as well as reduce the vibration level in sub-critical and post-flutter speeds. The developed aeroservoelastic model describes the pitch and plunge motion of a wing section associated with a single control surface. For state-space representation of the model, the measured pitch angle, plunge displacement and their derivatives are allocated as state vector, and control surface deflection as input command. For a given initial state conditions, two modes of open loop and closed loop control system are simulated. It is shown that, with a nonlinear structure in subsonic regime, the open loop system is unstable and Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) are generated. However, the closed loop system is asymptotically stable and converges to the origin. Therefore, the proposed approaches have a good performance on suppressing flutter and LCOs. However, comparing between the two approaches shows that SMC method requires larger control input, as well as a shorter time response with respect to SDRE method.", "authors": ["Mohammad Reza Elhami", "M.

The solver is essentially a scheduler for indexicals, i.e. reactive functional rules encoding local consistency methods performing incremental constraint solving or entailment checking, and global constraints, i.e. general propagators which may use specialized algorithms to achieve a higher degree of consistency or better time and space complexity. The solver has an open-ended design: the user can introduce new constraints, either in terms of indexicals by writing rules in a functional notation, or as global constraints via a Prolog programming interface. Constraints defined in terms of indexicals can be linked to 0/1-variables modeling entailment; thus indexicals are used for constraint solving as well as for entailment testing. Constraints can be arbitrarily combined using the propositional connectives by automatic expansion to systems of reified constraints.", "authors": ["Mats Carlsson", "Greger Ottosson", "Bj\u00f6rn Carlson"], "n_citation": 370, "references": ["02102c39-da49-44b8-8fa5-77f51664571b", "0cff5d73-afc6-47e3-9906-7f21e4cab620", "11243739-d3a0-4a34-a579-ab329738cfe0", "39a33ae2-b9c1-4f8e-af74-694d4108713e", "3b107361-1656-40c2-bdfd-1e9d941730bf", "6b90868c-72d1-4fec-8205-e841a2230719", "854a5476-186a-4400-9342-8b9a110767c5", "9638f471-1459-4531-bb05-17b2f3e0f78e", "cb416199-0778-456a-b7ce-becf3561588d", "e538675e-05ad-428e-bb0e-17348090f33f", "ee5b81a7-b59c-42af-97b1-82550b53db86"], "title": "An Open-Ended Finite Domain Constraint Solver", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "year": 1997, "id": "5f72d4e0-9d19-48ab-8a8d-42bec1255b0f"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, a spatially adaptive denoising algorithm is proposed which provides satisfactory results when the image is corrupted with the additive white Gaussian noise. Generally, suppression of Gaussian noise poses a trade-off problem between suppressing the noise and preserving the detailed information of the image. Detection of noise and suppression of noise are the two stages used in the proposed algorithm. Noise detection in the image is modeled as a pattern classification problem. Bayes classifier has been utilized to classify the pixels as noisy or non noisy. For effective noise suppression, a Gaussian filter is used in the proposed method which preserves detailed information as compared to PWMAD, SAWM and SADA methods. Bayesian classifier, computational cost, error detection, over-smoothness, and smoothing degree of reconstructed image are the parameters taken into account to effectively suppress the noise components in the proposed method.", "authors": ["Sarmila Padhy", "Swati Sagarika Padhi"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["2c27cb07-1d63-4416-8d85-83d4c50335f8", "517aefad-82ac-4355-86b7-e9e6571ea6f2", "5d209832-7a23-47bf-b9f2-9f6e02866f64", "9fe0fdb0-9255-451c-b6d3-358fcaa3edca", "b8e231f0-cf5c-4cba-9081-748faae61d0a"], "title": "Suppression of Gaussian noise using Bayesian classifier in an image", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "5f955359-98fc-4d22-94ce-d1bb90523591"}

It puts less emphasis on up-front plans and strict control and relies more on informal collaboration, coordination, and learning.   This briefing provides a characterization and definition of agile project management based on extensive studies of large-scale industrial projects. It explains the circumstances behind the change from traditional management with its focus on direct supervision and standardization of work processes, to the newer, agile focus on self-managing teams, including its opportunities and benefits, but also its complexity and challenges. The main focus of the briefing is the four principles of agile project management: minimum critical specification, autonomous teams, redundancy, and feedback and learning.   The briefing is intended for researchers, practitioners and educators in software engineering, especially project managers. For researchers, an updated state of the art will be uncovered, and the presentation will be based on current best evidence. For practitioners, principles, processes, and key success factors will be outlined and a successful large-scale case study of agile project management will be presented.

{"abstract": "Seventy-two participants were presented with specifications for each of three modular-sized computer programs. Nine different specification formats were prepared for each program. These formats varied along two dimensions: type of symbology and spatial arrangement. The type of symbology included natural language, constrained language (PDL), and ideograms (flowchart symbols). The spatial arrangement included sequential, branching, and hierarchical versions. The participants answered a series of comprehension questions on each program using only the program specifications. Three types of questions were presented: forward-tracing, backward-tracing, and input-output. Both forward- and backward-tracing questions were answered more quickly from specifications presented in PDL or ideograms than in natural language. Forward-tracing questions were answered most quickly from a branching arrangement, and backward-tracing questions were answered more quickly from branching and hierarchical arrangements.

Fog is a type of unwanted signal which create visuality difference between object and viewer. For removing this type of unwanted signal, digital filters are used. Digital filter is divided into two parts: finite impulse response (FIR) and infinite impulse response (IIR). The author introduced a new approach for improving the quality of foggy image and to increase peak signal to noise ratio. In this paper author used finite impulse response filter for foggy image which work over zero to finite time interval. In FIR filter, separable filter coefficients are used which reduce the amount of calculation. For improving image contrast hgamma correction function is used. After contrast adjustment of input image, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) is applied over an image and produce an enhanced image.

{"abstract": "The paper proposes a model recovery anti-windup (MRAW) scheme for linear time-invariant and discrete-time systems under magnitude and rate saturation. The method is a modified, discrete-time counterpart of the algorithm presented in [4]. As it is usual in the MRAW framework the AW compensator contains the exact copy of the plant in order that the ideal (unsaturated) behavior can be preserved in the states. The compensator is a controller that aims to push the plant towards this intended behavior. The design of this control action can be reduced to a construction of a stabilizing state feedback acting on the saturated plant. In [4] this feedback is a linear one, which is designed by convex optimization by enlarging the ellipsoidal approximation of the invariant domain. This paper presents a different, set-theoretic approach, which is based on the precise construction of the maximal control invariant set. The proposed control is a nonlinear one generated by point wise convex optimization.", "authors": ["Tamas Peni", "Balazs Kulcsar", "J\u00f3zsef Bokor"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["03656b15-eae5-44c5-bbe4-2bb0244d9277", "812731ea-3849-42f6-809d-cbc8d355d564", "9fc4764b-cef6-454a-a2ae-cdb93f7d41e3", "a42930b3-6e58-442b-a79c-09f1bff41ee6", "ddb74ffa-c7c6-4643-8eaf-aee67dd1e5a3", "e8d3698e-fe4f-49e4-8cae-cc3592a987f0"], "title": "Model recovery anti-windup control for linear discrete time systems with magnitude and rate saturation", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "5fc5e091-7270-4e1a-8469-14b6bf87bf46"}

For the most part this assistance is implicit and is provided automatically by the compiler. The most remarkable characteristic of PL/C is its perseverance\u2014it completes translation of every program submitted and continues execution until a user-established error limit is reached. This requires that the compiler repair errors encountered during both translation and execution, and the design of PL/C is dominated by this consideration.  PL/C also introduces several explicit user-controlled facilities for program testing. To accommodate these extensions to PL/I without abandoning compatibility with the IBM compiler, PL/C permits \u201cpseudo comments\u201d\u2014constructions whose contents can optionally be considered either source text or comment.

However, in order to objectively evaluate such concepts, it is necessary to undertake a thorough evaluation of the programming process itself. Most previous studies of this type have analyzed, by hand usually, a few instances of programs. This has led to some general conjectures; however, the amount of information that must be processed precludes any large scale analysis. In order to avoid this problem, an automatic data collection facility has been implemented as part of a PL/1 compiler at the University of Maryland. This system automatically collects information on each program that has been compiled - at almost no additional cost to the user of the compiler.

Callaway \u25b3 Abstract\u2014 Commercial buildings have inherent flexibility in how their HVAC systems consume electricity. We investigate how to take advantage of this flexibility. We first propose a means to define and quantify the flexibility of a commercial building. We then propose a contractual framework that could be used by the building operator and the utility to declare flexibility on the one side and reward structure on the other side. We then design a control mechanism for the building to decide its flexibility for the next contractual period to maximize the reward, given the contractual framework. Finally, we perform at-scale experiments to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. is controlled. In this paper, we identify and quantify \u201cflex- ibility\u201d. Then, a contractual framework between the utility and the building operator is designed so that the building can \u201cdeclare\u201d its flexibility and be rewarded for it. Finally, a control algorithm is proposed that allows the operation of building under this framework and at-scale experiments are carried out to demonstrate the high potential of commercial buildings as a source of flexibility, and the feasibility of the developed algorithm. I. I NTRODUCTION We focus on commercial buildings due to the following reasons: 1) Commercial buildings account for more than 35% of electricity consumption in the US. 2) More than 30% of commercial buildings have adopted Building Energy Management System (BEMS) technology which facilitate the communication with the grid system operators for providing flexibility. The majority of these buildings are also equipped with variable frequency drives, which in coordination with BEMS, can modulate the heating, ventilation and air con- ditioning (HVAC) system power consumption frequently (in the order of seconds). 3) Compared to a typical residential building, commercial buildings typically have larger HVAC systems and therefore consume more electricity. About 15% of electricity consumption in commercial buildings is related to the fans of HVAC systems. Fans are the main drivers to move the conditioned air from the air handling units (AHU) to the rooms for climate control. For instance, the main supply fans that feed Sutardja Dai Hall on UC Berkeley campus can spin at variable speeds, with the corresponding power consumption which is proportional to the cube of fan speed, with the maximum rated power of 134 KW or about 14% of the maximum power consumed in that building. Moreover, we can directly control their power, upward or downward making it an ideal candidate for ancillary demand-response. See [1]\u2013[5] for more information about the physics and control of HVAC systems. Consumers of energy usually do not pay attention to when they use energy. Demand for electricity tends to rise specially at times when it seems natural to use it; So natural in fact that we all tend to use it at the same time and in similar ways. On days when demand for electricity is high, extra power plants are needed to meet the demand. There are environmentally-friendly alternatives to adding more generation. Electricity customers can voluntarily trim their electricity use during peak periods or choose to use electricity at a less congested time, a strategy called \u201cSupply- Following\u201d (SF). With SF programs, utilities provide incen- tives to encourage consumers to reduce their demand during peak periods. Smart grids are enabling the transformation from a demand-following strategy to a supply-following one. Smart buildings are essential elements of the smart grid and can play a significant role in its operation. A building has some inherent flexibility in the way its HVAC system consumes electricity while respecting the comfort of its occupants. This flexibility could be used to reduce costs if the electricity price is time-varying, or could be traded (i.e., sold to the utility) if a proper contractual framework exists. Typically the electricity consumption of a commercial building is controlled by a process that aims at reducing costs. Among the many possible ways to design such a process, Model Predictive Control (MPC) stands out. In order to use the potential of commercial buildings as providers of flexibility to the smart grid, we need to fundamentally redesign the way a building, and in particular its HVAC, \u2020 Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of California, Berke- ley, CA 94720, USA.

{"abstract": "The effect of localization error in mobile sensor networks is investigated in this paper. Localization is an essential building block in mobile sensor networks, and is achieved through information exchange among the sensors. Sensor deployment algorithms often rely on the Voronoi diagram, which is obtained by using the position information of the neighboring sensors. In the sensor network coverage problem, it is desired to place each sensor in a proper position in its Voronoi cell such that its local coverage increases. On the other hand, it is often assumed that all measurements are sufficiently accurate, while in a practical setup even a small localization error may lead to significant uncertainty in the resultant Voronoi diagram. This paper is concerned with the degrading effect of position measurement error in the sensor network coverage problem. To this end, the effect of localization error on the boundaries of the Voronoi polygons is investigated. Two polygons are obtained for each sensor, and it is shown that the exact Voronoi polygon (corresponding to accurate localization) lies between them. The area between these two polygons is directly related to the size of error. A sensor deployment strategy is presented based on these two polygons, using a quantitative local density function which takes the uncertainty of the Voronoi polygons into account to maximize the local coverage of each sensor.", "authors": ["Jalal Habibi", "Hamid Mahboubi", "Amir G.

{"abstract": "For many applications first-principles nonlinear dynamic models are preferred by practitioners. Parameter estimation for these models is often a non-trivial and time consuming task. The use of optimally designed dynamic inputs can reduce the experimental burden and increase the accuracy of the estimated parameters. Traditionally, piecewise polynomial input sequences are exploited for this purpose. In contrast, this paper proposes optimal experiment design with the use of random phase multisine inputs, which are typically used for black box model identification. The main motivations are (i) the practical requirement that the inputs have to be concentrated around an operating point, and (ii) the fact that fast dynamics have to be included in the input profile without introducing a large number of discretization parameters. Moreover, multisines can be designed to excite exclusively a specific frequency band of interest. As an illustration, optimal inputs are designed and validated experimentally for estimating the parameters important for the dynamical behaviour of a Diesel engine air path model.", "authors": ["Ioanna Stamati", "Dries Telen", "Filip Logist", "E.

Despite its higher fault-detection ability over other structural testing techniques, practical DFT remains a significant challenge. This paper tackles this challenge by introducing a hybrid DFT framework: (1) The core of our framework is based on dynamic symbolic execution (DSE), enhanced with a novel guided path search to improve testing performance, and (2) we systematically cast the DFT problem as reach ability checking in software model checking to complement our DSE-based approach, yielding a practical hybrid DFT technique that combines the two approaches' respective strengths. Evaluated on both open source and industrial programs, our DSE-based approach improves DFT performance by 60~80% in terms of testing time compared with state-of-the-art search strategies, while our combined technique further reduces 40% testing time and improves data-flow coverage by 20% by eliminating infeasible test objectives. This combined approach also enables the cross-checking of each component for reliable and robust testing results.", "authors": ["Ting Su", "Zhoulai Fu", "Geguang Pu", "Jifeng He", "Zhendong Su"], "n_citation": 15, "references": ["0197430a-04cf-4318-8211-09edf2a6ff5f", "02c721e8-7a7e-4371-a3a4-47c09551e03a", "064d8f5e-868d-43ca-91cf-3ceb51bba854", "06a0ca5c-cef2-4398-b5c2-a01b3d2a43ca", "0d89ee51-90ff-4653-a547-adfd849d18d4", "11fd84b1-0262-43b2-9a5e-24b4a7756de4", "13c57286-b6b5-4beb-8547-dfb7d1cf40a5", "156e6fea-8358-47eb-a929-8a00bff82c30", "1902c6be-8e17-4e32-877f-f0321658dbcd", "19a8a6d6-3356-450f-a435-b0ccf48988d3", "19d30e7b-f632-4eba-9737-5453cecebc14", "226aa5f0-500c-4ac1-874e-33bb395f6d8b", "22b06dda-755b-4423-9fe4-1f5724164be6", "274e19c6-3489-4c68-b2bf-8948aef5e525", "2ac5fedd-db52-4207-ac12-b527da60b604", "33845340-b0f3-41ef-97ef-a837a2aae362", "33e6a0f3-07ec-4c1a-977c-46c63a4e149b", "37e4712e-eafd-4187-b63c-9e161ea962b6", "3e96cb40-b163-4d97-815b-5398964a3fd9", "43a55524-a6d3-4a18-8dce-651e05400836", "4b187335-0533-4aa7-bb30-4e6dfa6d968a", "4b6174b7-1643-4805-bcb3-f720241b1bc0", "4decc580-85f7-4fa6-9e94-e523373498f8", "5a5cb142-42d9-492d-8296-0856d9106b26", "5e251597-ece6-4a4f-ac5a-39e780a19073", "5edf8e80-e11f-4ddc-8051-23ec0b49c6a9", "5fcfd132-e4b8-40cf-8447-db956065c4c7", "67261b29-e58a-4fb0-b040-f9451f2e7fbb", "71c47dd0-a7ff-4b97-a640-1186dd9ac968", "76cea084-096f-476c-a922-4f6a0b22bec0", "7fb255cd-234a-4e6c-82ff-c1adc0935d85", "85f50443-209c-44f3-9408-196b739b1e21", "86489724-282a-4483-80dc-df28dcaac4b7", "972042aa-6b41-4667-9dbf-9227620948ec", "b24d08c6-05fa-47dd-bbdb-9f09003d6a41", "b6040d51-b60d-41fd-ac45-49bbde0b8fb9", "b6b849c9-ae98-489a-8646-50b9146d48de", "baeca1db-4bac-438c-acf8-e42c7c82a5e9", "bbf63508-4a93-4494-89a8-f9180242a7dc", "c56344a6-7332-4d69-8bd4-910f8c458d07", "c5730f79-6a10-4a8d-bcdb-542559151f73", "c7e5b54c-b2bf-4c90-bd04-c7371591b113", "db1fb080-1898-4bb4-917e-c31f1be1a470", "dbe948b3-842e-46bc-893e-166e92795011", "e29d459a-e7dc-4cb0-8473-945c7e9a7d5d", "f4868b9a-0719-4748-a708-d32c9c8ffdfb"], "title": "Combining symbolic execution and model checking for data flow testing", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "60aff4b4-cd53-47f0-b7d9-2e86f98741d5"}

It intends to mitigate the sources of uncertainty of software testing processes, by learning from past experience and, at the same time, adapting the technique selection to the current testing session. The method is based on machine learning strategies. It uses offline strategies to take historical information into account about the techniques performance collected in past testing sessions; then, online strategies are used to adapt the selection of test cases to the data observed as the testing proceeds. Experimental results show that techniques performance can be accurately characterized from features of the past testing sessions, by means of machine learning algorithms, and that integrating this result into the online algorithm allows improving the fault detection effectiveness with respect to single testing techniques, as well as to their random combination.", "authors": ["Domenico Cotroneo", "Roberto Pietrantuono", "Stefano Russo"], "n_citation": 10, "references": ["058390dd-95c5-4852-b307-498c38686def", "08588a4a-1a07-4c64-b2ca-12edb3e646da", "14267265-46eb-4192-9c0a-eff0ad70fc0e", "26f3f491-99f1-4ebc-8d17-6cb245f9c9ce", "2ecd5d03-99fa-4407-ad9e-565c4e2982d3", "2f02c44e-db7a-4359-9526-a54292179d3b", "41361ded-9471-45e4-96a8-f3a0a31de890", "688d96cf-89c7-4d8f-b882-ae07ded70bbd", "6c8579f0-8761-4895-a2d2-1ce21f40970d", "88658c48-a5b7-42cb-90e3-0a2e7123780f", "8afc4f24-0abe-437f-977e-375ec3ec907d", "a1853113-dd04-44ae-9e76-a0ddfbf49084", "b3ce1326-e16e-4043-bc90-8d37904857fe", "ca9689d0-a2b9-4fa1-a70e-c250926272ce", "d12b0618-709f-4c20-8381-d6c7926bf54f", "d2532770-9d82-47c2-b560-6268ebb79b49", "d5a44f14-60d8-4dd8-98a2-f805830df6cd", "da236a5b-d7a4-423c-a344-a5afe9b444a0"], "title": "A learning-based method for combining testing techniques", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "6109e4b3-0261-42e2-8fc4-a1fc492d00d0"}

{"abstract": "Virtual machine monitors (VMMs) are a popular platform for Internet hosting centers and cloud-based compute services. By multiplexing hardware resources among virtual machines (VMs) running commodity operating systems, VMMs decrease both the capital outlay and management overhead of hosting centers. Appropriate placement and migration policies can take advantage of statistical multiplexing to effectively utilize available processors. However, main memory is not amenable to such multiplexing and is often the primary bottleneck in achieving higher degrees of consolidation.   Previous efforts have shown that content-based page sharing provides modest decreases in the memory footprint of VMs running similar operating systems and applications. Our studies show that significant additional gains can be had by leveraging both subpage level sharing (through page patching) and incore memory compression. We build  Difference Engine , an extension to the Xen VMM, to support each of these---in addition to standard copy-on-write full-page sharing---and demonstrate substantial savings across VMs running disparate workloads (up to 65%). In head-to-head memory-savings comparisons, Difference Engine outperforms VMware ESX server by a factor 1.6--2.5 for heterogeneous workloads.

{"abstract": "We study a two-channel quasi-ring network composed of two reconfigurable optical add-drop multiplexers (ROADMs) equipped with dynamic gain equalizers (WSS/DGEs) and two constant gain controlled optical amplifiers. We conduct an equilibrium and stability analysis on the quasi ring network because it is the simplest scenario in which optical channel power can oscillate within a loop. Due to the difference of time scale between pump control and channel power equalization, we treat the amplifiers in the loop as static nonlinear function mappings. Based on this mapping and considering transmission delay, we show that a specific type of channel flattening control by a output-average tracking WSS/DGE can cause oscillations in the quasi-ring network.

{"abstract": "Recently, dynamical systems which appear in engineering and science problems become increasingly larger and too complex. One of the ways to solve the difficulty is to model the systems with hierarchical and network structures. In this talk, we propose a framework of the hierarchical network identification which models large-scale systems with such structures. This framework identifies both subsystems and network structure by making use of a partial information on the structure and internal signals. We first reduce the hierarchical network identification problem to an identification problem of state feedback systems under some assumptions on the homogeneity of subsystems and the network structure.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of control strategy syn- thesis for robots that interact with external agents, together known as the environment. Both the robot and the environment are modeled as dynamical systems with differential constraints and take part in a nonzero-sum two-player differential game to fulfill their respective task specifications while satisfying a set of safety rules. They minimize a cost function that is representative of the level of unsafety with respect to these safety rules. Throughout, the problem is motivated by an autonomous car in an urban environment that interacts with other cars in situations such as navigating stop signs at road junctions and single-lane roads. Ideas behind sampling-based motion- planning algorithms are used to incrementally construct a finite Kripke structure abstraction of a continuous dynamical system. Model-checking techniques for safety rules expressed using Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) are then leveraged to propose an algorithm which synthesizes a control strategy for the two- player game. We analyze the algorithm to show that, with probability one, it converges to the Stackelberg equilibrium asymptotically.

{"abstract": "Today's wireless sensor nodes can be easily attached to mobile platforms such as robots, cars and cell phones enabling pervasive sensing of physical fields (say of temperature, vibrations, air quality and chemicals). We address the sensor arrangement problem, i.e. when and where sensors should take samples to obtain a good estimate of a field using mobile sensors. In particular, we focus on incidentally mobile sensors that move passively under the influence of the environment (e.g. sensors attached to floating buoys, cars and smartphones carried by humans). We model the field as a linear combination of known basis functions. Given the samples, we use a linear estimator to find unknown coefficients of the basis functions. We formulate the sensor arrangement problem as one of finding suitably characterized classes of sensor arrangements that lead to a stable reconstruction of the field. We consider a family of multidimensional \u03b4-dense sensor arrangements, where any square disc of size \u03b4 contains at least one sample, and derive sufficiency conditions for the arrangement to be stable. \u03b4-dense sensor arrangements are geometrically intuitive and are easily compatible with the incidental mobility of sensors in many situations. We present simulation results on the stability of such arrangements for two-dimensional basis functions. We also present an example for constructing basis functions through proper orthogonal decompositions for a one-dimensional chemical diffusion field in a heterogeneous medium, which are later used for field estimation through \u03b4-dense sampling.", "authors": ["Sumeet Kumar", "Ajay Deshpande", "Sanjay E.

{"abstract": "The empirical assessment of test techniques plays an important role in software testing research. One common practice is to instrument faults, either manually or by using mutation operators. The latter allows the systematic, repeatable seeding of large numbers of faults; however, we do not know whether empirical results obtained this way lead to valid, representative conclusions. This paper investigates this important question based on a number of programs with comprehensive pools of test cases and known faults. It is concluded that, based on the data available thus far, the use of mutation operators is yielding trustworthy results (generated mutants are similar to real faults). Mutants appear however to be different from hand-seeded faults that seem to be harder to detect than real faults.", "authors": ["James H. Andrews", "Lionel C.

{"abstract": "In this paper, wavelet based multiscale PCA algorithm is proposed for effective compression of smart grid data under normal as well as fault conditions. The signal decomposition is done using wavelet transform, followed by the de-correlation using PCA, to achieve maximum compression, while simultaneously preserving the dominant modes of the signal and bad data rejection. The optimum decomposition scale of wavelet transform is selected based on the energy of wavelet coefficients in each scale. The proposed algorithm employing multiscale PCA computes the principal components of the wavelet coefficients at each scale, followed by combining the results at relevant scales. The wavelet coefficients of a particular scale corresponding to the dominant eigen values are retained for signal compression. The dominant modes in the signal are sorted based on their energy content. This overcomes the drawback of false detection of modes and lower accuracy of estimation which arises when systems of higher order are used. Prony analysis is performed to check ability of the compression strategy to preserve the modal information. The phasor data are simulated under fault conditions in the IEEE 30-bus system. The results from Prony analysis indicate that multiscale PCA effectively compresses the disturbance signals while preserving the model information of the signal.", "authors": ["Rachit Mehra", "Viresh Patel", "Faruk Kazi", "Navdeep M.

{"abstract": "For the purposes of this paper, a block-transfer CCD memory is composed of serial shift registers whose shift rate can vary, but which have a definite minimum shift rate (the refresh rate) and a definite maximum shift rate. The bits in the shift registers are numbered 0 to  N  - 1, and blocks of  N  bits are always transferred, always starting at bit 0. What is the best shift strategy so that a block transfer request occurring at a random time will have to wait the minimal amount of time before bit 0 can be reached? The minimum shift rate requirement does not allow one to simply \u201cpark\u201d at bit 0 and wait for a transfer request. The optimal strategy involves shifting as slowly as possible until bit 0 is passed, then shifting as quickly as possible until a critical boundary is reached, shortly before bit 0 comes around again. This is called the \u201churry up and wait\u201d strategy and is well known outside the computer field.

In this new construct a version is defined as a pair (revision, variant), and a variant as a vector of attribute values. With these language constructs the \u201cknowledge\u201d about the program versions can be expressed by facts and rules.

{"abstract": "This paper discusses the design and implementation of a deconverter framework for the Malayalam Language. The Universal Networking Language or UNL facilitates translation between Natural Languages across the world. The paper focuses on the linguistic aspects of Malayalam required for the deconversion process.

A Morphological Generator takes care of generation of Malayalam words with the appropriate case endings and features, with respect to the cases and UNL attributes present in the UNL expression. The words are rearranged by the Syntax Planning Module to produce proper Natural Language sentences. These language dependent features for Malayalam have been successfully incorporated into a Deconverter Framework that handles English and Tamil currently. The Deconverter for Malayalam can currently produce simple Malayalam sentences and handle sentences with single clausal phrases also. It is being enhanced to handle more types of sentences. The present system is a small achievement towards attaining a complete translation facility for the Malayalam language.

{"abstract": "Measuring the similarity of words is important in accurately representing and comparing documents, and thus improves the results of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The NLP community has proposed various measurements based on WordNet, a lexical database that contains relationships between many pairs of words. Recently, a number of techniques have been proposed to address software engineering issues such as code search and fault localization that require understanding natural language documents, and a measure of word similarity could improve their results. However, WordNet only contains information about words senses in general-purpose conversation, which often differ from word senses in a software-engineering context, and the software-specific word similarity resources that have been developed rely on data sources containing only a limited range of words and word uses.     In recent work, we have proposed a word similarity resource based on information collected automatically from StackOverflow. We have found that the results of this resource are given scores on a 3-point Likert scale that are over 50% higher than the results of a resource based on WordNet. In this demo paper, we review our data collection methodology and propose a Java API to make the resulting word similarity resource useful in practice.

{"abstract": "A common tool for proving the termination of programs is the  well-founded set , a set ordered in such a way as to admit no infinite descending sequences. The basic approach is to find a  termination function  that maps the values of the program variables into some well-founded set, such that the value of the termination function is repeatedly reduced throughout the computation. All too often, the termination functions required are difficult to find and are of a complexity out of proportion to the program under consideration.   Multisets  ( bags ) over a given well-founded set  S  are sets that admit multiple occurrences of elements taken from  S . The given ordering on  S  induces an ordering on the finite multisets over  S . This  multiset ordering  is shown to be well-founded. The multiset ordering enables the use of relatively simple and intuitive termination functions in otherwise difficult termination proofs. In particular, the multiset ordering is used to prove the termination of  production systems , programs defined in terms of sets of rewriting rules.", "authors": ["Nachum Dershowitz", "Zohar Manna"], "n_citation": 629, "references": ["566b7188-0165-4959-9dec-972355fd6e6f", "5e701e34-3618-42fd-a23b-feb61ee61981"], "title": "Proving termination with multiset orderings", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 1979, "id": "61f1cb4b-f39f-49a1-80e2-87cfb387f59e"}

{"abstract": "Information Retrieval (IR) methods, and in particular topic models, have recently been used to support essential software engineering (SE) tasks, by enabling software textual retrieval and analysis. In all these approaches, topic models have been used on software artifacts in a similar manner as they were used on natural language documents (e.g., using the same settings and parameters) because the underlying assumption was that source code and natural language documents are similar. However, applying topic models on software data using the same settings as for natural language text did not always produce the expected results.     Recent research investigated this assumption and showed that source code is much more repetitive and predictable as compared to the natural language text. Our paper builds on this new fundamental finding and proposes a novel solution to adapt, configure and effectively use a topic modeling technique, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), to achieve better (acceptable) performance across various SE tasks. Our paper introduces a novel solution called LDA-GA, which uses Genetic Algorithms (GA) to determine a near-optimal configuration for LDA in the context of three different SE tasks: (1) traceability link recovery, (2) feature location, and (3) software artifact labeling. The results of our empirical studies demonstrate that LDA-GA is ableto identify robust LDA configurations, which lead to a higher accuracy on all the datasets for these SE tasks as compared to previously published results, heuristics, and the results of a combinatorial search.", "authors": ["Annibale Panichella", "Bogdan Dit", "Rocco Oliveto", "Massimilano Di Penta", "Denys Poshynanyk", "Andrea De Lucia"], "n_citation": 128, "references": ["123ae906-1a8b-41a9-bc09-1fef3e5a03ab", "186d778f-f1e3-49fb-be36-45d03e06621f", "1c51521c-4239-4e6f-8665-2e15bb6c8b7c", "1f9907ea-06a8-478e-a8b7-ee8e7a80cf02", "1ffe6e34-a8a9-4f84-b4b2-e32eb325d827", "37284cce-7ea3-4cb9-aba5-d17f5bfdb027", "4233ce65-062e-4c0a-86af-b0246dde5b40", "42a88bb2-e1e7-46f1-bc2b-2e170f6549af", "47c2c88f-17b8-4fda-83ba-f54382a7a3c4", "545dae4f-7803-4fe4-aa66-192087ab9f34", "5a17d651-1cdd-430e-8ff5-233dc3541aae", "6a6b9aa6-683f-4c7c-b06e-9c3018d10fd3", "6aec772b-ed45-4adc-b53f-c3dba2be760e", "7677c4d2-bb47-4ec9-b230-e447a73d7ddf", "7a1afa5b-f967-42d4-a36a-33eba8f94e0b", "7a5bc59e-1f51-476e-b3d3-219f5d67624d", "92b2e4a7-52bc-4e95-af3d-c624af0a962c", "951a3c0b-0588-45db-9ea9-f7d038f5eaa3", "9f982009-62b8-4f61-9687-a7fab481d3ca", "a175a6f7-9eb7-41ec-85dc-d75da3424097", "a960d05e-4c39-4c8e-b559-dbdc17db6194", "aad8c011-876f-4703-acce-76f5c1184dc7", "ac14afe6-de4d-4056-b2ac-0f6e36f369a2", "dc9a7f74-01ef-4145-b060-dacdfc4d9613", "e427f800-7a52-4845-a774-fd5c823634d2", "e7b3547a-09f3-45ef-a63c-1fbb7d58c56d", "eabbbfc1-e52b-4240-b408-628f00cd1ede", "eb047184-ae27-4d77-8715-5c1995d228b5"], "title": "How to effectively use topic models for software engineering tasks? an approach based on genetic algorithms", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "621cbb55-0b62-42b3-9fae-1bec1c3be7aa"}

{"abstract": "In past and recent years, the issues related to managing technical debt received significant attention by researchers from both industry and academia. There are several factors that contribute to technical debt. One of these is represented by code bad smells,  i.e. , symptoms of poor design and implementation choices. While the repercussions of smells on code quality have been empirically assessed, there is still only anecdotal evidence on  when  and  why  bad smells are introduced. To fill this gap, we conducted a large empirical study over the change history of 200 open source projects from different software ecosystems and investigated when bad smells are introduced by developers, and the circumstances and reasons behind their introduction. Our study required the development of a strategy to identify smell-introducing commits, the mining of over 0.5M commits, and the manual analysis of 9,164 of them ( i.e. , those identified as  smell-introducing ). Our findings mostly contradict common wisdom stating that smells are being introduced during evolutionary tasks. In the light of our results, we also call for the need to develop a new generation of recommendation systems aimed at properly planning smell refactoring activities.", "authors": ["Michele Tufano", "Fabio Palomba", "Gabriele Bavota", "Rocco Oliveto", "Massimiliano Di Penta", "Andrea De Lucia", "Denys Poshyvanyk"], "n_citation": 87, "references": ["0439f8a9-787c-488a-95b2-22d475b450f5", "0ef0ce02-1a87-43fc-a5be-30d50b4500cb", "11ce5536-d5e4-4a54-9f6b-9898831bde18", "23df4c0d-d282-4e87-b12c-8b838c685905", "24fa3a27-7dd8-4b8a-b9f7-58c4a48a0432", "25938663-af02-455e-ae32-c587ed995d1e", "29b58ca9-7e3a-4b87-93d4-8bf59379d9b0", "3162347e-9594-466f-9db5-4e1a0710836a", "3521a1c3-796e-4e8e-ad02-5582b8fb50da", "4812bccd-7543-470f-9506-38d7b7f1f00d", "4a1c57e7-b451-4080-9284-741f4c8bef2f", "4cdb2485-5634-4388-b7cf-1a4db90fd5bb", "58b21470-e293-4fbf-b495-d44a1c3bbfc7", "62b21ba2-0424-464f-aae4-2fe8ad2fcc00", "6912f7bd-f385-4eb9-8d1e-60efbf570e04", "700bf1fb-326d-4409-b6ca-2c64f9aa09c0", "7fa0ace3-e749-454b-8b8a-817f0892ac9b", "91213bd2-c578-469f-b6a8-b5fea47cf43a", "95e73786-0138-42e3-9a04-ad560336d264", "9abae5ee-8d21-4584-b009-129e691be427", "a3bb3164-c639-406e-9296-170aaa728397", "a6d2522f-1dfc-4fd4-8f13-bea0fc6ecf05", "a95bbd91-6090-40a6-830e-50811f7e29ac", "b611b13b-91ed-4e40-9632-30f4d944907f", "b9e8ee1d-cfe9-4d5a-a823-8a83c3abd0ff", "baeb44c4-9b29-4ab8-ba05-4c560ba8bc1c", "bc66bf86-e0a4-469d-8aa2-f59382edb521", "c28cf51b-79cf-4b24-9234-8b304f11e6ca", "c47ad26e-8df8-4130-b80c-bda27273635b", "caef1320-f270-4274-af8d-0e971a47aab3", "cb5f2654-bbe6-46da-8812-29fa13b8488c", "ccf0facb-fa9f-42c5-94bd-0d0181ffdae6", "d309b502-c574-4246-896b-e9c80ff7ec6c", "d32786fc-ea8d-41f0-a803-5d00e550329c", "d4c1bea7-03ef-47bd-960b-afa9f484d474", "d8a1cb21-13ac-47c1-8ef6-13f25fa7eac7", "db99d024-2b7c-44c9-9644-1a7f316bfb53", "deb5cccd-fc3c-418a-9008-73e2324ef20e", "e8fd7443-0dc5-476a-8719-308134df9078", "f4ff67c0-d703-4b47-bb9b-bb073d4fdc1a"], "title": "When and why your code starts to smell bad", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "624de74b-f12f-428d-9dd3-c874f2afd717"}

{"abstract": "Program comprehension is an important cognitive process that inherently eludes direct measurement. Thus, researchers are struggling with providing suitable programming languages, tools, or coding conventions to support developers in their everyday work. In this paper, we explore whether functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), which is well established in cognitive neuroscience, is feasible to soundly measure program comprehension. In a controlled experiment, we observed 17 participants inside an fMRI scanner while they were comprehending short source-code snippets, which we contrasted with locating syntax errors. We found a clear, distinct activation pattern of five brain regions, which are related to working memory, attention, and language processing---all processes that fit well to our understanding of program comprehension. Our results encourage us and, hopefully, other researchers to use fMRI in future studies to measure program comprehension and, in the long run, answer questions, such as: Can we predict whether someone will be an excellent programmer? How effective are new languages and tools for program understanding?

{"abstract": "This paper expands staleness-based memory leak detection by presenting a machine learning-based framework. The proposed framework is based on an idea that object staleness can be better leveraged in regard to similarity of objects; i.e., an object is more likely to have leaked if it shows significantly high staleness not observed from other similar objects with the same allocation context.     A central part of the proposed framework is the modeling of heap objects. To this end, the framework observes the staleness of objects during a representative run of an application. From the observed data, the framework generates training examples, which also contain instances of hypothetical leaks. Via machine learning, the proposed framework replaces the error-prone user-definable staleness predicates used in previous research with a model-based prediction.     The framework was tested using both synthetic and real-world examples. Evaluation with synthetic leakage workloads of SPEC2006 benchmarks shows that the proposed method achieves the optimal accuracy permitted by staleness-based leak detection. Moreover, by incorporating allocation context into the model, the proposed method achieves higher accuracy than is possible with object staleness alone. Evaluation with real-world memory leaks demonstrates that the proposed method is effective for detecting previously reported bugs with high accuracy.", "authors": ["Sangho Lee", "Changhee Jung", "Santosh Pande"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0abf39d4-3e1f-4f9c-af3e-496278cfa17b", "12a96f4b-93cd-4cdd-9481-a7a764c7f84e", "17a573e4-aa3a-4e9e-b901-051b72a84c27", "20170a3b-c353-4dd3-8199-4664e3b72453", "2752fa93-6d80-491d-ad27-46566d116dc4", "2e950236-6f15-4b19-a64a-673a52675706", "36626a80-f5a6-4b48-854b-0f6ec97af26f", "38e3fba9-ba08-4118-bd8d-68ed9e2b593a", "401b1e1d-c037-430f-8a53-dd5807f852a4", "4ac215da-bb39-445c-9759-ebdb3faf472e", "4dd2a94c-970c-438e-82fd-e0708375c1b7", "50dd56db-151d-4d62-8576-65f0ef6f381b", "701abeac-7889-4518-ae13-b513e03aea22", "789f6311-b9ec-442e-be20-d27a40a91c7b", "8ec678d3-4fc6-4c88-9d36-21a57b3fa6ab", "9007c9eb-8310-4be5-900c-96102fc2eab6", "91979159-37d8-410f-a245-a33ef80a092b", "93884ea7-8de0-43b1-be34-6cdd03e81184", "9bc161bd-7bdd-4e0b-ba66-75a7c7348c60", "a729dc3b-039b-445a-b63f-df2edfb534c4", "bb0ee0b4-1b75-4972-83c5-4f12bfbc2a56", "c1b6b493-01ef-420f-be44-7bacfe34e846", "c5be513d-7fdc-497a-81a0-86433166b201", "d2d53598-deca-4236-9f1e-fe85a3ed54cd", "d4c6e113-08fd-48f4-b5dc-0a95fa617611", "eb70880d-e621-424c-9b2b-b33d6204619a", "ec1c9678-b8c9-4949-ad6a-8132ccaa082d", "fb673f86-044e-47aa-8173-53eb4c40bfe7", "fe251137-6a0c-41dc-8eba-31e97f5dfb9e"], "title": "Detecting memory leaks through introspective dynamic behavior modelling using machine learning", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "62b97374-f88b-4cc2-9389-0e0645b37e6b"}

{"abstract": "The widespread use of complex third generation computing systems has led to a much broader concern about the means by which the resources of these systems are allocated among the user community. One means that is suggested more and more frequently is a pricing procedure. In this paper the manner in which one would like to allocate computing resources is considered, and then the extent to which a pricing mechanism fits this mold is discussed. Inasmuch as pricing must serve as a rationing mechanism at times, consideration is given to the means by which prices can be adjusted flexibly in order to make a dynamic allocation of resources. Consideration is also given to the means by which users can be insulated from the harmful effects of frequent price fluctuations.  Although the subject of pricing has been given a lot of attention recently, a number of misconceptions persist about its purpose and its operation. An attempt is made to clarify some of these misunderstandings and to highlight the advantages and disadvantages of pricing.

{"abstract": "We investigate stochastic averaging theory in continuous time for locally Lipschitz systems and the applications of this theory to stability analysis of stochastic extremum seeking algorithms. First, we establish a general stochastic averaging principle and some related stability theorems for a class of continuous-time nonlinear systems with stochastic perturbations and remove or weaken several significant restrictions present in existing results: global Lipschitzness of the nonlinear vector field, equilibrium preservation under the stochastic perturbation, global exponential stability of the average system, and compactness of the state space of the perturbation process. Then, we propose a continuous-time extremum seeking algorithm with stochastic excitation signals instead of deterministic periodic signals.

{"abstract": "Data set allocation in today's multilevel storage systems is usually based on qualitative, ad hoc decisions. While it would be desirable to obtain an optimal solution to this allocation problem, it is clear that the number of parameters involved makes it intractable to straight-forward solution. In such a situation, we must find a set of assumptions which simplify the problem greatly, but which still provide a basis for considering all significant cost elements. This paper presents such a first, quantitative allocation step. It considers many of the significant detailed costs of system utilization, data storage, data staging, and data migration. Although many avenues of further improvement are available, the present algorithm seems to be usefully accurate. As such, it can aid in quantifying the problems of data set allocation, storage system configuration, and new device designs.", "authors": ["Vincent Y. Lum", "Michael E. Senko", "Ching-Chy Wang", "H.

{"abstract": "A key goal of performance testing is the detection of performance degradations (i.e., regressions) compared to previous releases. Prior research has proposed the automation of such analysis through the mining of historical performance data (e.g., CPU and memory usage) from prior test runs. Nevertheless, such research has had limited adoption in practice. Working with a large industrial performance testing lab, we noted that a major hurdle in the adoption of prior work (including our own work) is the incorrect assumption that prior tests are always executed in the same environment (i.e., labs). All too often, tests are performed in heterogenous environments with each test being run in a possibly different lab with different hardware and software configurations. To make automated performance regression analysis techniques work in industry, we propose to model the global expected behaviour of a system as an ensemble (combination) of individual models, one for each successful previous test run (and hence configuration). The ensemble of models of prior test runs are used to flag performance deviations (e.g., CPU counters showing higher usage) in new tests. The deviations are then aggregated using simple voting or more advanced weighting to determine whether the counters really deviate from the expected behaviour or whether it was simply due to an environment-specific variation. Case studies on two open-source systems and a very large scale industrial application show that our weighting approach outperforms a state-of-the-art environment-agnostic approach. Feedback from practitioners who used our approach over a 4 year period (across several major versions) has been very positive.", "authors": ["King Chun Foo", "Zhen Ming Jiang", "Bram Adams", "Ahmed E.

{"abstract": "Many problems in dynamic data driven modeling deals with distributed rather than lumped observations. In this paper, we show that the Monge-Kantorovich optimal transport theory provides a unifying framework to tackle such problems in the systems-control parlance. Specifically, given distributional measurements at arbitrary instances of measurement availability, we show how to derive dynamical systems that interpolate the observed distributions along the geodesics. We demonstrate the framework in the context of three specific problems: (i) \\emph{finding a feedback control} to track observed ensembles over finite-horizon, (ii) \\emph{finding a model} whose prediction matches the observed distributional data, and (iii) \\emph{refining a baseline model} that results a distribution-level prediction-observation mismatch. We emphasize how the three problems can be posed as variants of the optimal transport problem, but lead to different types of numerical methods depending on the problem context.

The resulting prototype system substantiates the claims of increased modularity, effective code reuse and rapid prototyping that characterize the DSL approach to systems design. It also illustrates the need for judicious interface design: relegating computationally expensive tasks to XVision (pre-existing C++ components) and leaving modular compositional tasks to FVision (Haskell). At the same time, our experience demonstrates how Haskell's advanced language features (specifically, parametric polymorphism, lazy evaluation, higher-order functions and automatic storage reclamation) permit a rapid DSL design that is itself highly modular and easily modified. Overall, the resulting hybrid system exceeded our expectations: visual tracking programs continue to spend most of their time executing low-level image processing code, while Haskell's advanced features allow us to quickly develop and test small prototype systems within a matter of a few days, and to develop realistic applications within a few weeks.", "authors": ["Alastair Reid", "John Peterson", "Gregory D.

{"abstract": "Abstract -- Asserts have long been a strongly recommended (if non-functional) adjunct to programs. They certainly don't add any user-evident feature value; and it can take quite some skill and effort to devise and add useful asserts. However, they are believed to add considerable value to the developer. Certainly, they can help with automated verification; but even in the absence of that, claimed advantages include improved understandability, maintainability, easier fault localization and diagnosis, all eventually leading to better software quality. We focus on this latter claim, and use a large dataset of asserts in C and C++ programs to explore the connection between asserts and defect occurrence. Our data suggests a connection: functions with asserts do have significantly fewer defects. This indicates that asserts do play an important role in software quality; we therefore explored further the factors that play a role in assertion placement: specifically, process factors (such as developer experience and ownership) and product factors, particularly interprocedural factors, exploring how the placement of assertions in functions are influenced by local and global network properties of the callgraph. Finally, we also conduct a differential analysis of assertion use across different application domains.", "authors": ["Casey Casalnuovo", "Premkumar T.

{"abstract": "Maintenance costs can be substantial for large organizations (several hundreds of programmers) with very large and complex software systems. By large we mean lines of code in the range of hundreds of thousands or millions. Our research objective is to improve the process of handling anomaly reports for large organizations. Specifically, we are addressing the problem of the manual, laborious and time consuming process of assigning anomaly reports to the correct design teams and the related issue of localizing faults in the system architecture. In large organizations, with complex systems, this is particularly problematic because the receiver of an anomaly report may not have detailed knowledge of the whole system. As a consequence, anomaly reports may be assigned to the wrong team in the organization, causing delays and unnecessary work. We have so far developed two machine learning prototypes to validate our approach. The latest, a re-implementation and extension, of the first is being evaluated on four large systems at Ericsson AB. Our main goal is to investigate how large software development organizations can significantly improve development efficiency by replacing manual anomaly report assignment and fault localization with machine learning techniques. Our approach focuses on training machine learning systems on anomaly report databases; this is in contrast to many other approaches that are based on test case execution combined with program sampling and/or source code analysis.", "authors": ["Leif Jonsson"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["04e2aa5a-c214-4454-80a2-93805272dc4e", "14caffec-24d3-4281-91ae-4963045e94f3", "56159371-a48f-4a4c-8db6-9a1ee3ac6cbb", "7e931708-ce01-44b4-ac9e-ada99f2cc827", "8026f56a-a93e-4933-8ead-c9aa9e3f0498", "826b743b-8bd8-4225-b369-edb87dac0ab3", "c7dda81c-0759-4906-9b8c-dc02aafacb05", "d5a44f14-60d8-4dd8-98a2-f805830df6cd", "e0783c00-90b9-4849-a650-114ffb62cf17", "eabb8559-ae8f-420a-91e8-5d9a7f574c9f", "eafe671d-f6eb-4a21-be0d-b7e697e04d70"], "title": "Increasing anomaly handling efficiency in large organizations using applied machine learning", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "63dcc870-e099-4b08-9ead-26c8bb5d3842"}

Detection of incipient faults in such engines could be significantly manifested by taking advantage of transient data (e.g., during takeoff).

In particular, Markov model-based analysis of steady state data is extended by taking advantage of the available transient data.

For the special class of GFSR generators considered by Arvillias and Maritsas based on the primitive trinomial D p  + D q  + 1 with q = an integral power of 2, it is shown that the sequence is k-distributed if and only if the lengths of all subregisters are at least k.

{"abstract": "A firsthand account of an international team effort to install the Sahana disaster-management system in Chengdu, Sichuan after an earthquake.    On Monday May 12, 2008, an earthquake measuring 7.9 on the Richter scale struck in Sichuan Province in southwestern China, destroying homes, schools, hospitals, roads, and vital power and communication infrastructure. More than 45 million people were affected---tens of thousands were killed, hundreds of thousands injured, millions of people were evacuated and left homeless, and millions of buildings were destroyed.    When the earthquake hit, several members of what became an international, volunteer, disaster-management IT team were attending a workshop in Washington, D.C. The workshop was organized by the IBM Office of Corporate Citizenship and Corporate Affairs department to train IBM personnel and others in the use and deployment of Sahana, a free and open source software (FOSS) disaster management system.    Sahana, which means  relief  in Sinhalese, is a Web-based collaboration tool that helps manage information resources during a disaster recovery effort. It supports a wide range of relief efforts from finding missing persons, to managing volunteers, tracking resources, and coordinating refugee camps. Sahana enables government groups, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the victims themselves to work together during a disaster recovery effort.    Over the next several weeks, the team members, distributed among several cities (Beijing and Chengdu in China, Hartford and New York in the U.S., and Colombo in Sri Lanka), worked together over global communication channels to configure and deploy Sahana in Chengdu, in order to support the disaster recovery effort there.    The organizations involved in the collaboration included:    \u2022  The Lanka Software Foundation  (LSF), developers of the Sahana system. Three LSF members, led by the second author, were conducting the training workshop.    \u2022  Various departments of IBM , including Business Continuity and Resiliency Services. Ten employees led by the fourth author, who organized the workshop, were receiving instruction in how to deploy and use Sahana.    \u2022  The Humanitarian FOSS Project  (H-FOSS), an NSF-funded effort aimed at revitalizing undergraduate computing education. Four students and their mentors, the first and third authors, were attending the workshop as developers and undergraduate members of the Sahana community.    \u2022  IBM China . Initially, local teams in Beijing and Chengdu consisting of corporate citizenship, government relations, and technical professionals led in demonstrating Sahana to local officials, securing buy-in, and establishing channels to proceed. Then a large team of developers, language specialists, and others, including a team based in Chengdu, Sichuan, eventually took charge of the deployment effort in Chengdu. The fifth author was a member of the China development team.    Almost immediately after the earthquake, discussions were held between IBM, IBM China, China's Ministry of Civil Affairs, and the Chengdu city government in Sichuan province. Once the Chengdu government expressed real interest in deploying Sahana, a team was formed to begin the process of localizing Sahana---that is, translating its user interface into simplified Chinese. The team was led by executives and software developers from IBM-China and assisted by Sahana team members in Colombo and student H-FOSS volunteers in Hartford.    The team's organizational structure followed the normal procedure involved in previous Sahana deployments---a local group in close proximity to the incident supported by volunteers from the global Sahana community. In this case IBM-China, including some who were directly affected by the disaster, took the lead in deploying Sahana over an intensive three-week period.    The decision by the Chengdu government to proceed with the deployment was taken on May 21, 2008 and a revised and localized version of Sahana was deployed in Chengdu on May 25. On June 12 we learned that 42 families had been reunited with the help of Sahana.    This article provides an inside look at the deployment effort. It describes how a diverse, multidisciplinary team---professional programmers, software engineers, executives from a large global enterprise, students, faculty, and humanitarian IT specialists from a global FOSS community---worked together to assist the earthquake recovery effort. The success of the collaboration illustrates the power of virtual communities working across international boundaries using a variety of electronic communication software. It also demonstrates that the Internet has truly made us all neighbors and is constantly forcing us to redefine our concept of community.", "authors": ["Ralph Morelli", "Chamindra de Silva", "Trishan R. de Lanerolle", "Rebecca Curzon", "Xin Sheng Mao"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["0f510b65-c6fd-4cd4-8327-5bba06f15fb7", "3dfa1b06-2aa1-47f1-8ac2-7b5ff38d5965", "5290ba3a-e3b5-489f-9157-a648b85dcacb", "734136a5-7e43-4457-9c18-0d9648c31a53", "f3c1ebbf-19c5-4681-b912-e78e32d270a8"], "title": "A global collaboration to deploy help to China", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2010, "id": "64765097-3a67-45b9-b141-d2fb650ccf60"}

{"abstract": "We present empirical evidence that metrics on communication artifacts generated by groupware tools can be used to gain significant insight into the development process that produced them. We describe a test-bed for developing and testing communication metrics, a senior level software engineering project course at Carnegie Mellon University, in which we conducted several studies and experiments from 1991-1996 with more than 400 participants. Such a test-bed is an ideal environment for empirical software engineering, providing sufficient realism while allowing for controlled observation of important project parameters. We describe three proof-of-concept experiments to illustrate the value of communication metrics in software development projects. Finally, we propose a statistical framework based on structural equations for validating these communication metrics.

In some cases, they enabled specific problems in the engineering processes to be identi- fied, thus demonstrating the value of metrics and other in- strumentation for process improvement. However, software code is only one of the many artifacts produced during soft- ware development. Moreover, it is often available only late in the process. The infrastructure and the resources needed to collect metrics on code are also non-negligible, and often prevents their use for identifying problems as they occur. Communication artifacts, such as electronic mail, memo- randa, or records generated by groupware tools, represent a different perspective on the development process. They are available throughout the project, they capture information about a more comprehensive set of artifacts (e.g., code, pro- cess, organization, politics, morale), and their form is inde- pendent of implementation technology, development infra- structure, or even the existence of a product. Metrics ap- plied to such communication artifacts can, therefore, pro- vide significant insight into the development process that produced them. In this paper, we discuss the design and evaluation of a set of communication metrics for software development. Our goal is to develop metrics that enable the assessment of a tool or a method in the context of a project. Our long-term goal is to provide metrics that help identifying problems as they occur. In Section 2, we illustrate possible uses of these metrics with an example.", "authors": ["Bernd Bruegge", "Allen H.

{"abstract": "The paper discusses an effective approach on cooperative path planning for two or more autonomous ground vehicles (AGVs). These multi-AGVs coordinate their path effectively to accomplish complex and critical tasks for various applications. The proposed architecture accommodates two or more AGVs in the same workspace and each vehicle in the workspace shares their kinematic and sensor information with the others. Each individual has to replan its own path accounting for other AGVs and obstacles. Effective D* lite algorithm is used to calculate individual paths. The AGVs utilize both proprioceptive (internal sensor data) and exteroceptive (external sensor data) sensors to perceive their surroundings for avoiding interference with each other and with the obstacles. The proposed approach is tested on MobileSim, simulation software, and on pioneer 3DX mobile robots in real-time scenarios. Later, the simulated and experimental results are compared and discussed.", "authors": ["Sobers L. X. Francis", "Sreenatha G.

{"abstract": "Design patterns document solutions to recurring design and development challenges. UML, as the de-facto modeling language in software development, aims to support defining and using patterns in models. However, as is demonstrated in the paper, the support is not sufficient for all kinds of patterns and all meaningful ways to use patterns. In this paper, the use of design patterns is suggested for documentation purposes in Model-Driven Development. The pattern support of UML is complemented with an approach that does not constrain the structures that can be used in patterns. The approach, which is tool supported in a model-driven development environment for control applications, also enables specification of part of the information content of patterns that UML leaves intact. The developed tool support includes instantiating and highlighting patterns in models and gathering of traceability information on use of patterns.", "authors": ["Timo Veps\u00e4l\u00e4inen", "Seppo Kuikka"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["0627fab7-042b-498e-9b0e-b21ec8e5e974", "68349809-efd5-4238-a3b5-fedd57ad8594", "787751e4-c1e3-46ac-9c14-859912321aa8", "87eb02e6-dd3c-40cd-8c81-e77fabb1d21d", "9e0c3724-c41b-4442-8a67-75bbdee94988", "b59a4cbf-149c-4567-8a39-4a424aa096c0", "c27065ae-2b74-4f9f-8ab8-033fd994c70f", "c4c00c6f-6806-4204-8d79-454349b10ccf", "f48bf51b-1a5f-482d-9d00-64d3d5f1e89b"], "title": "Design pattern support for Model-Driven Development", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "64b2d54b-2b97-409d-a9aa-e18398a7b507"}

{"abstract": "Concurrent programs are prone to various classes of difficult-to-detect faults, of which data races are particularly prevalent. Prior work has attempted to increase the cost-effectiveness of approaches for testing for data races by employing race detection techniques, but to date, no work has considered cost-effective approaches for re-testing for races as programs evolve. In this paper we present SimRT, an automated regression testing framework for use in detecting races introduced by code modifications. SimRT employs a regression test selection technique, focused on sets of program elements related to race detection, to reduce the number of test cases that must be run on a changed program to detect races that occur due to code modifications, and it employs a test case prioritization technique to improve the rate at which such races are detected. Our empirical study of SimRT reveals that it is more efficient and effective for revealing races than other approaches, and that its constituent test selection and prioritization components each contribute to its performance.", "authors": ["Tingting Yu", "Witawas Srisa-an", "Gregg Rothermel"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["01e33550-973b-4bbd-83c2-832784ebfba1", "022d57a1-668e-4823-bf3e-e1a761a075de", "0352cabb-a737-4277-b1c5-de27c97c52d8", "0ed73fc7-0a43-4035-baeb-2ae130c184d5", "119162d6-0403-4980-8096-f6fa5d9fc228", "220efd2d-9969-41aa-9034-54bc43ee3eae", "22a6eb1f-ac35-4302-bbe5-7c5532dd0a85", "22d752e8-37f8-4d04-a952-442273436874", "30521aed-580e-4260-8074-24f470294419", "34ceb3fb-197b-4c68-ab72-9de587254bae", "38586b4e-3ca7-4516-b74f-7a588c5baa69", "42c11fb4-20bf-4a72-9e35-a549fccd68ba", "4fc5dfcc-f896-4fbc-b3b8-0a5636213d88", "511eaf8e-45ce-40ca-9060-090a8eef1cc6", "518d18af-423b-4e71-9892-9f46600ad8e6", "53577a95-d855-41b3-9ac2-6287b4f0262b", "57545135-709b-4cd1-b9a6-3167477884c8", "62e24d3f-a586-4ef3-b4aa-54f093bb7ec3", "695d82b9-dedf-4c33-9b0e-13035047f13e", "6c20a4a2-0e3f-4446-b2e9-5f454d91b1c9", "6e8ea39b-5d8f-43e5-9663-84abb1b52da6", "7f0f937c-f854-47ff-b5fb-aca9314414b9", "813f966e-0a35-4ae8-8f89-a2b43187482d", "84d6b71c-7e30-41c0-9d8c-fcd5e44b2550", "86aef39c-8a32-4779-bbca-cfcb488cad0c", "8ba5783c-0839-4264-acd5-f856ea8cfc20", "8cad2033-0f09-4f01-aa96-8e39e35692d6", "8d8adc5a-c221-4ec5-962d-68c5d379eec8", "98757ab7-2df9-486d-84be-02da3a5b1cbd", "a121d8e1-b00e-4d8f-9994-34095595c75e", "a15be498-5824-4f7a-b98b-f270a99d67f5", "a3227b6f-097e-49a6-85b7-823e76e0991b", "a3921949-ef96-4f72-9fa1-de54c33a5e9f", "a3ff4d40-8eac-4835-9325-6b9f7aebde58", "aaa4ad59-e4e7-4454-8a80-c603aaf9f276", "b62bd685-7803-42dc-8ce1-15a6835d2801", "bed97152-67c3-4673-a46a-e25a2318888b", "c0bd4ff6-2f39-49a8-8b61-f59486a007cb", "c4c9de24-747e-4bf7-a061-8dc1039b1e17", "c5f1a8eb-a395-402c-8c76-9102938e7414", "d6513692-83aa-4b8d-9691-de32226cfcdc", "d67678fa-b55a-49c4-a79c-cdd01f6b2a4f", "de4c497b-5468-4ca6-bb18-d0c979688c10", "e378da79-a61b-4d8e-a5e8-a0daf2a520d8", "e705f7e0-2e0c-4d35-a07f-c3fa9cb94952", "f3bac542-c8e9-445f-9c83-d9d724e0def0", "fae6805c-b379-4d11-972d-76644b22601c", "fd2ab972-8790-4d67-b1cc-9659a9a67a96"], "title": "SimRT: an automated framework to support regression testing for data races", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "64e34383-e54b-4a18-9a99-b0e2a1598535"}

{"abstract": "In the present paper we discuss numerical solution strategies for robust optimal control problems. Here, our motivation is to optimize the dynamic open-loop behaviour of a kite, which is affected by unknown wind turbulence. After reviewing some existing strategies for robust optimal control, we specialize on a particular approach which uses a Lyapunov differential equation in order to approximate the influence of the uncertainties on the state of the dynamic system and to guarantee stability of periodic systems. We propose strategies to exploit the structure of the corresponding formulation and provide an open-source implementation of the algorithm. The practical advantage of this implementation is illustrated by applying it to a robustness and stability optimization problem for a power generating kite system. Here, the model equations and system parameters are inspired from a real-world application.", "authors": ["Julia Sternberg", "Boris Houska", "Moritz Diehl"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["4389249f-15f9-49bb-9bd9-b91cebae82e2", "55473a2a-feb8-48d6-89a1-744474c2e6fb", "88263832-baaa-48af-9862-eb97aca15458", "8cf723f9-abb3-4968-bdaf-bbb30654846e", "9f27cef6-c521-462f-8a2c-f7cff05936f2", "e08c3ef3-3cef-4dc4-bdae-8dda1cb9977f", "f36fa851-af64-4053-b42f-6b92b5d7afe4"], "title": "A structure exploiting algorithm for approximate robust optimal control with application to power generating kites", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "64fedf2b-0c2b-48fd-8272-c8737930f946"}
{"abstract": "At the heart of the ICSE-2005 program are the 44 research papers selected by the Program Committee (PC) from the 313 submissions to the conference. All submissions were rigorously reviewed by the PC -- each submission received reviews from at least three different PC members. The PC then met on 5-6 November 2004 in Newport Beach, California, USA, to discuss the submissions and make the final selections for the program. Each of the papers selected for publication in the proceedings and presentation at the conference was chosen on its own merits and without comparison to any others.The papers selected cover a wide range of research areas, which are not always amenable to a simple classification. Nevertheless, the papers are clustered into sessions that broadly represent the dominant research themes of the work described.The PC comprised 43 members drawn from a wide cross section of the software engineering community. The PC members worked hard to put the program of research papers together. Each PC member received an average of 22 papers to review prior to the PC meeting, followed by a substantial e-mail conversation and two full days discussing papers at the PC meeting. It was our pleasure and privilege to work with such a professional group of people to produce the quality of the program before you. Our deepest thanks go to the PC.We must also thank the organizers of SIGSOFT FSE 2005, who generously hosted our PC meeting and assisted in numerous local arrangements. In particular, we thank Dick Taylor, Debra Brodbeck, and Susan Knight. Their help in producing a trouble-free, enjoyable PC meeting helped keep the PC's spirits high through two long days.We would be remiss if we did not lavish praise and thanks on Richard van de Stadt and the CyberChair conference management system. CyberChair streamlined many of the PC's activities, and Richard added several new features to CyberChair that saved us days of work in staging the PC meeting.Finally, we thank our General Chair, Catalin Roman, for bringing us together, making us partners in creating ICSE 2005, and giving us the guidance and freedom we needed to create the best possible research program.

{"abstract": "Model quality is a key factor that affects the control performance of model predictive control. In this paper, a new closed-loop model assessment approach is proposed to assess model deficiency from routine closed-loop data. The proposed model quality index is a minimum variance benchmark for the model residuals obtainable from closed-loop data. From the feedback invariant principle the disturbance innovations at current instance are shown to be unaffected by the controller even if it is a nonlinear time-varying controller. Then it is shown that the disturbance innovations sequence can be estimated from closed loop data by an orthogonal projection of the current output onto the space spanned by past outputs, inputs or setpoints. With the disturbance innovations as the benchmark, a model quality index is developed by using the ratio of a quadratic form of model residuals and that of the estimated disturbance innovations. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is shown by simulation results.", "authors": ["Zhijie Sun", "S.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a fast array of wimpy nodes---FAWN---an approach for achieving low-power data-intensive data-center computing. FAWN couples low-power processors to small amounts of local flash storage, balancing computation and I/O capabilities. FAWN optimizes for per node energy efficiency to enable efficient, massively parallel access to data.   The key contributions of this paper are the principles of the FAWN approach and the design and implementation of FAWN-KV---a consistent, replicated, highly available, and high-performance key-value storage system built on a FAWN prototype. Our design centers around purely log-structured datastores that provide the basis for high performance on flash storage, as well as for replication and consistency obtained using chain replication on a consistent hashing ring. Our evaluation demonstrates that FAWN clusters can handle roughly 350 key-value  queries per Joule  of energy---two orders of magnitude more than a disk-based system.", "authors": ["David G.

{"abstract": "CORC is an experimental computing language that was developed at Cornell University to serve the needs of a large and increasing group of computer users whose demands are both limited and intermittent. These are the laymen of the computing world, who chose to become as little concerned as possible in the computing process and mechanics, but who would like to benefit from the computational ability that is now commonplace. At a university most of the faculty and student users would fall into this category. In recognition of the current significance of the computer in every area of business, science and engineering there is increasing faculty interest in introducing some use of modern computation into the students' academic experience if this can be done without placing too great a  burden on an already hard-pressed curriculum. But computing is not going to be widely used in mathematics and engineering courses if the mechanics of its use are a burden to either the teacher or the student, or if the time necessary to prepare, test and operate programs cuts significantly into the subject matter for which the course was intended. Some participation on the part of the student appears to be an academic virtue, as well as a practical economic necessity\u2014we have never heard any university computing center expansionist, in his wildest moments, propose a completely closed shop programming-operating service for general undergraduate use. In their own research many of the faculty are in the same position as their students. They will use the computer if it is convenient to  do so and if it does not involve a major diversion into a technical field which is essentially extraneous to the basic subject matter. The closed-shop computing service in which the professor has (in principle anyway) only to describe his problem to a professional is of course intended to serve this need but we believe it is axiomatic that no university computing center will ever be adequately staffed to", "authors": ["Richard W.

{"abstract": "A data abstraction can be naturally specified using algebraic axioms. The virtue of these axioms is that they permit a representation-independent formal specification of a data type. An example is given which shows how to employ algebraic axioms at successive levels of implementation. The major thrust of the paper is twofold. First, it is shown how the use of algebraic axiomatizations can simplify the process of proving the correctness of an implementation of an abstract data type. Second, semi-automatic tools are described which can be used both to automate such proofs of correctness and to derive an immediate implementation from the axioms.

{"abstract": "Today most computer scientists believe that NP-hard problems cannot be solved by polynomial-time algorithms. From the polynomial-time perspective, all NP-complete problems are equivalent but their exponential-time properties vary widely. Why do some NP-hard problems appear to be easier than others? Are there algorithmic techniques for solving hard problems that are significantly faster than the exhaustive, brute-force methods? The algorithms that address these questions are known as exact exponential algorithms.The history of exact exponential algorithms for NP-hard problems dates back to the 1960s. The two classical examples are Bellman, Held and Karps dynamic programming algorithm for the traveling salesman problem and Rysers inclusionexclusion formula for the permanent of a matrix. The design and analysis of exact algorithms leads to a better understanding of hard problems and initiates interesting new combinatorial and algorithmic challenges. The last decade has witnessed a rapid development of the area, with many new algorithmic techniques discovered. This has transformed exact algorithms into a very active research field. This book provides an introduction to the area and explains the most common algorithmic techniques, and the text is supported throughout with exercises and detailed notes for further reading.The book is intended for advanced students and researchers in computer science, operations research, optimization and combinatorics.", "authors": ["Fedor V.

{"abstract": "This paper introduces a control structure based on the semi-nonnegative matrix factorization (SNMF) to simultaneously control multiple subsystems with a reduced number of inputs. The inspiration for this new control construct is a pin array human machine interface, called Digital Clay. Digital Clay uses a row-column method to control many actuators with a few inputs. The singular value decomposition (SVD) was previously studied to simultaneously control all of the actuators when using the row-column method. However, the SVD technique is not physically implantable in the row-column structure of Digital Clay due to the non-negativity constraints of the control signal. This paper proposes a system based on the SNMF, which is a low-rank approximation method with non-negativity constraints. An SNMF algorithm is presented, and its implementation in a feedback control loop, called the SNMF System, is discussed.

{"abstract": "Introduction    Usability evaluation is essential to make sure that software products newly released are easy to use, efficient, and effective to reach goals, and satisfactory to users. For example, when a software company wants to develop and sell a new product, the company needs to evaluate usability of the new product before launching it at a market to avoid the possibility that the new product may contain usability problems, which span from cosmetic problems to severe functional problems.   Three widely used methods for usability evaluation are Think Aloud (TA), Heuristic Evaluation (HE) and Cognitive Walkthrough (CW). TA method is commonly employed with a lab-based user testing, while there are variants of TA methods, including thinking out aloud at user's workplace instead of at labs. What we discuss here is the TA method that is combined with a lab-based user testing, in which test users use products while simultaneously and continuously thinking out aloud, and experimenters record users' behaviors and verbal protocols in the laboratory. HE is a usability inspection method, in which a small number of evaluators find usability problems in a user interface design by examining an interface and judging its compliance with well-known usability principles, called heuristics. CW is a theory-based method, in which evaluators evaluate every step necessary to perform a scenario-based task, and look for usability problems that would interfere with learning by exploration. These three methods have their own advantages and disadvantages. For instance, TA method provides good qualitative data from a small number of test users, but laboratory environment may influence test user's behaviors. HE is a cheap, fast and easy-to-use method, while it often finds too specific and low-priority usability problems, including even not real problems. CW helps find mismatches between users' and designers' conceptualization of a task, but it needs extensive knowledge of cognitive psychology and technical details to apply.   However, even though these advantages and disadvantages show overall characteristics of three major usability evaluation methods, we cannot compare them quantitatively and see their efficiency clearly. Because one of reasons why so-called discounted methods, such as HE and CW, were developed is to save costs of usability evaluation, cost-related criteria for comparing usability evaluation are meaningful to usability practitioners as well as usability researchers. One of the most disputable issues related to cost of usability evaluation is sample size. That is, how many users or evaluators are needed to achieve a targeted usability evaluation performance, for example, 80% of overall discovery rate? The sample size of usability evaluation is known to depend on an estimate of problem discovery rate across participants. The overall discovery rate is a common quantitative measure that is used to show the effectiveness of a specific usability evaluation method in most of usability evaluation studies. It is also called overall detection rate or thoroughness measure, which is the ratio of 'the sum of unique usability problems detected by all experiment participants' against 'the number of usability problems that exist in the evaluated systems', ranging between 0 and 1. The overall discovery rates were reported more than any other criterion measure in the usability evaluation experiments and also a key component for projecting required sample size for usability evaluation study. Thus, how many test users or evaluators participate in the usability evaluation is a critical issue, considering its cost-effectiveness.", "authors": ["Wonil Hwang", "Gavriel Salvendy"], "n_citation": 180, "references": ["057c2538-96c2-4f3d-9259-ee53837ced10", "2e68b565-26a7-4307-b6a4-46fb8630a6c8", "57464c7f-7555-471c-91f8-c63b4e60d6bb", "6a03ebfe-d078-441d-b54d-46b0128a2604", "93f66c5f-5d66-4d10-8738-abe9f33147b5", "9e5d3684-beb5-4ca2-8758-164ffbaf1fa5", "c461c64b-2fc0-4553-b052-5cb29d20cfa6", "df9d1854-fa68-4b6e-b71a-fe832155f77c"], "title": "Number of people required for usability evaluation: the 10\u00b12 rule", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2010, "id": "65cdcb93-1c31-44de-b7a4-594a727b7d19"}

{"abstract": "Debugging consumes significant time and effort in any major software development project. Moreover, even after the root cause of a bug is identified, fixing the bug is non-trivial. Given this situation, automated program repair methods are of value. In this paper, we present an automated repair method based on symbolic execution, constraint solving and program synthesis. In our approach, the requirement on the repaired code to pass a given set of tests is formulated as a constraint.

We show that the reliability growth predicted by non-homogeneous Poisson process models was found for only one of these testing strategies.

{"abstract": "The Process Design Engineering Program, under the direction of the Ballistic Missile Defense Advanced Technology Center, has as its objective the development of a unified software engineering discipline addressing all software development problems from receipt of software requirements to delivery of the operational software system. During the first two years of this program, initial process design engineering and management procedures were developed which led to the systematic top-down development of real-time software processes. A prototype set of software tools to support these procedures was designed and implemented as Process Design System 1 (PDS 1 ), and an experimental BMD baseline software process was then designed and implemented using these techniques and tools.   The baseline experiment demonstrated that although the basic concepts employed were effective for the tactical software (1), there were several deficiencies in the process design tools. The most important deficiency stemmed from the fact that the system was designed to support the development of only the tactical software. This resulted in the operating system software (the most difficult component) being implemented without the aid of PDS and in assembly language at cost of thirty percent of the budget for nine percent of the code. Additional problem areas were the lack of positive control over data accessing, inadequate data structuring capability, and the interruption and synchronization of operations.", "authors": ["R. G.

The principle of the approach rests on the modeling of the vehicle thanks to a bicycle model. The lateral tire forces are well known to be highly non-linear. However, in normal driving region, those force can be approximated as linear. The detection of the critical situation is done when the physical data provided by the sensors on the vehicle do not anymore match with the linear tire force. The problem of the detection of critical situation is so rewritten as a problem of a fault detection, where some dedicated approaches are given in the literature. Since the vehicle model depends on its longitudinal speed, an extension of the parity space approach for linear parameter varying system is handled.

A modelbased quasi-decentralized networked control structure that enforces closed-loop stability with minimal data transfer, while simultaneously taking into account the different communication delays associated with the transfer of information between the constituent subsystems, is developed. In this structure, each control system includes: (1) a set of predictive models each of which predicts the evolution of the state variables of a given neighboring unit when measurements are unavailable and is updated when communication is restored, and (2) a set of propagation models each of which uses the delayed measurements from a given unit, together with the past values of the estimated local control action, to generate an estimate of the current state which is then used to update the state of the corresponding model. A combined discrete-continuous system formulation of the networked closed-loop plant is developed and analyzed, leading to an explicit characterization of the closed-loop stability properties in terms of the update period, the communication delay sizes, the degree of plant-model mismatch, and the selection of controller design parameters.

{"abstract": "Product turnaround time (TAT) is defined as the clock or elapsed time from wafer release to completed wafer fabrication. It is also known as cycle time, mean elapsed time, or manufacturing lead time. Turnaround time is arguably more important in semiconductor fabrication than in any other industry because it has a major impact on contamination levels, process control capabilities, yield-learning rates and product costs.  Semiconductor manufacturers must strictly control particulate contamination to achieve high device yields. Longer turnaround times increase the opportunity for the particles to migrate to wafer surfaces, even in strict clean-room environments [11]. The negative relationship between time and product yields is shown in Figure 1.  Submicron device fabrication also demands stringent process control capability. Variation in time between steps is a major contributor to process variability, directly affecting process yields. Sequential processes performed minutes apart may produce significantly different results than the identical processes performed hours apart because the properties of materials change over time.  The slope of the yield learning curve is also a function of turnaround time. Slow feedback because of high turnaround times delays problem recognition and verification of solutions. Semiconductor fabrication is especially sensitive to turnaround time because definitive functional results are not available until circuits are completely fabricated on the wafe\u2014typically hundreds of process steps after the raw silicon wafers are released into the manufacturing line. Figure 2 depicts the relationship between turnaround time, shown as a multiple of theoretical or raw process time (RPT), and the yield learning rate.  The impact of longer turnaround time is not limited to reduced yields. Longer TAT also increases product costs. For example, a line with a 1O-day TAT that starts 1,000 wafers a day will have 10,000 wafers of work-in-process (WIP). A line with the same wafer starts per day (WSD) but an 11-day TAT will have 11,000 wafers in WIP. The longer TAT causes higher carrying costs for partially finished goods, more space for WIP storage, additional resources for product tracking and control, and many other additional expenses.  Minimizing turnaround time is critically important in the semiconductor industry due to its major contribution to greater product yields and lower costs. However, it is not the only determinant of success in semiconductor manufacturing. State-of-the-art facilities cost hundreds of millions of dollars to build and equip, due to requirements for cleanliness, vibration control, chemical and gas purity and other components that are specified to angstroms and sub-microns. The semiconductor industry's capital-intensive nature demands high throughput rates and maximum utilization of resources to attain a competitive cost per wafer.  The amount of work-in-process (WIP), also known as line-loading levels, affects both turnaround time and throughput performance. Throughput analysis techniques [4, 6] generate curves demonstrating that infinite levels of work in process maximize throughput (Figure 3) by ensuring that resources never starve for work. Queuing theory analysis [1] produces curves that show minimum line-loading levels produce minimum turnaround times by eliminating time spent queued for busy resources (Figure 4). The inverse shapes of these two performance curves demonstrate the inherent conflict in line-loading decisions when attempting to both maximize throughput and minimize turnaround time.  Wafer fabrication involves hundreds of individual tools performing multiple processes to produce an array of sophisticated end products. Actual turnaround time and throughput curves for each tool depend on many variables unique to that tool, such as arrival rates, service rates, rework rates, failure rates, and starvation and blockage opportunities. Resolution of the line-loading conflict is especially difficult given the complexity of semiconductor manufacturing, and simulation emerges as perhaps the only currently existing methodology for taking into account the detailed interactions among elements in such a manufacturing environment [3, 14].", "authors": ["David J.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach based on chain code histogram features enhanced through Laplacian of Gaussian filter for off-line signature verification. In the proposed approach, the four-directional chain code histogram of each grid on the contour of the signature image is extracted. The Laplacian of Gaussian filter is used to enhance the extracted features of each signature sample. Thus, the extracted and enhanced features of all signature samples of the off-line signature dataset constitute the knowledge base. Subsequently, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is used as the verification tool. The SVM is trained with the randomly selected training sample's features including genuine and random forgeries and tested with the remaining untrained genuine along with the skilled forge sample features to classify the tested/questioned sample as genuine or forge. Similar to the real time scenario, in the proposed approach we have not considered the skilled fore sample to train the classifier. Extensive experimentations have been conducted to exhibit the performance of the proposed approach on the publicly available datasets namely, CEDAR, GPDS-100 and MUKOS, a regional language dataset. The state-of-art off-line signature verification methods are considered for comparative study to justify the feasibility of the proposed approach for off-line signature verification and to reveal its accuracy over the existing approaches.", "authors": ["R.

{"abstract": "As software evolves, impact analysis estimates the potential effects of changes, before or after they are made, by identifying which parts of the software may be affected by such changes. Traditional impact-analysis techniques are based on static analysis and, due to their conservative assumptions, tend to identify most of the software as affected by the changes. More recently, researchers have begun to investigate dynamic impact-analysis techniques, which rely on dynamic, rather than static, information about software behavior. Existing dynamic impact-analysis techniques are either very expensive---in terms of execution overhead or amount of dynamic information collected---or imprecise. In this paper, we present a new technique for dynamic impact analysis that is almost as efficient as the most efficient existing technique and is as precise as the most precise existing technique. The technique is based on a novel algorithm that collects (and analyzes) only the essential dynamic information required for the analysis. We discuss our technique, prove its correctness, and present a set of empirical studies in which we compare our new technique with two existing techniques, in terms of performance and precision.", "authors": ["Taweesup Apiwattanapong", "Alessandro Orso", "Mary Jean Harrold"], "n_citation": 154, "references": ["0347cf54-de86-4035-b13d-61e49fbed024", "28e8f5e5-dceb-4b04-b149-69f41c593254", "4aafeefd-c5fb-4baf-8fac-0acde02f070c", "76cc2160-30eb-4ef9-9752-9d28cbb91667", "922494b7-4ffa-4896-a48d-711c955bad93", "9c5ad1a5-92c7-478f-beef-ba29ba4d3e94", "a5a113a2-4394-4343-922a-03525b7f2305", "b1143634-16d5-49b4-9f77-9bca362b76c6", "b3ef4366-2f14-467b-b784-2a854c8695fe", "d041e3ac-898d-45e7-80b8-6c10f417b70b", "d393167b-12ad-4a7c-8ca9-2bb7d644cdc9", "fd6e18c4-1f25-4308-95dd-1d2ab71af017"], "title": "Efficient and precise dynamic impact analysis using execute-after sequences", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2005, "id": "66fd40f6-81c1-435a-85e9-0dbf3b04e763"}

{"abstract": "Introduction    Since the September 11 th  attacks on the World Trade Center, tsunami disaster, and hurricane Katrina, there has been renewed interest in emergency planning in both the private and public sectors. In particular, as managers realize the size of potential exposure to unmanaged risk, insuring \"business continuity\" (BC) is becoming a key task within all industrial and financial sectors (Figure 1).   Aside from terrorism and natural disasters, two main reasons for developing the BC approach in the finance sector have been identified as unique to it: regulations and business specificities.   Regulatory norms are key factors for all financial sectors in every country. Every organization is required to comply with federal/national law in addition to national and international governing bodies. Referring to business decisions, more and more organizations recognize that Business Continuity could be and should be strategic for the good of the business. The finance sector is, as a matter of fact, a sector in which the development of information technology (IT) and information systems (IS) have had a dramatic effect upon competitiveness. In this sector, organizations have become dependent upon technologies that they do not fully comprehend. In fact, banking industry IT and IS are considered production not support technologies. As such, IT and IS have supported massive changes in the ways in which business is conducted with consumers at the retail level. Innovations in direct banking would have been unthinkable without appropriate IS. As a consequence business continuity planning at banks is essential as the industry develops in order to safeguard consumers and to comply with international regulatory norms. Furthermore, in the banking industry, BC planning is important and at the same time different from other industries, for three other specific reasons as highlighted by the Bank of Japan in 2003:   \u2022  Maintaining the economic activity of residents in disaster areas  by enabling the continuation of financial services during and after disasters, thereby sustaining business activities in the damaged area;   \u2022  Preventing widespread payment and settlement disorder  or preventing systemic risks, by bounding the inability of financial institutions in a disaster area to execute payment transactions;   \u2022  Reduce managerial risks  for example, by limiting the difficulties for banks to take profit opportunities and lower their customer reputation.   Business specificities, rather than regulatory considerations, should be the primary drivers of all processes. Even if European (EU) and US markets differ, BC is closing the gap. Progressive EU market consolidation necessitates common rules and is forcing major institutions to share common knowledge both on organizational and technological issues.   The financial sector sees business continuity not only as a technical or risk management issue, but as a driver towards any discussion on mergers and acquisitions; the ability to manage BC should also be considered a strategic weapon to reduce the acquisition timeframe and shorten the data center merge, often considered one of the top issues in quick wins and information and communication technology (ICT) budget savings.", "authors": ["Fabio Arduini", "Vincenzo Morabito"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["5179c450-9feb-4b2c-8480-07e9eec0ae7f", "59d83f8f-29a2-47ae-a6aa-108ad08cda4a", "7447e5d0-8837-44b5-850c-7eb2c7bfb1a3", "c74ee044-6c44-42fc-9043-aeab236745f1"], "title": "Business continuity and the banking industry", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2010, "id": "671796a2-adc0-41eb-9050-5f7f11167c6e"}

We present lightweight, static, heuristic analyses for recovering the intended layout of data in a stripped binary. Comparison against DWARF debugging information shows high precision and recall rates for inferring source-level object boundaries. On a collection of benchmarks, our analysis eliminates a third to a half of incorrect object boundaries identified by an IDA Pro-inspired heuristic, while retaining nearly all valid object boundaries.   In addition to measuring their accuracy directly, we evaluate the effect of using the recovered data for improving the precision of static buffer-overrun detection in the defect-detection tool CodeSonar/x86.

{"abstract": "In the past 40 years, software engineering has emerged as an important sub-field of computer science. The quality and productivity of software have been improved and the cost and risk of software development been decreased due to the contributions made in this sub-field. The software engineering community needs to invest much more efforts to cope with the drastically increasing demands on the information technology as well as the extremely open and dynamic nature of the Internet. The history of software engineering is reviewed with emphasis on the driving forces of software and the milestones of software engineering development. The history of software engineering in China is reviewed with emphasis on the relationship between software engineering and the software industry. Based on the above reviews, we argue that software engineering should become an independent discipline along with computer science and co-operative efforts from academia, governments and industries should be needed for the harmonious development of software engineering.

Several examples are given; the results with respect to the number of disk accesses and disk space are compared to other common approaches. Algorithms evaluating the appropriateness of the above approach to a given information system are described.

{"abstract": "Three decades have passed since the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) promulgated  Guidelines on the Transborder Flows of Personal Data , and still the issue of transborder flows of personal data continues to plague policymakers, industry, and individuals who have no idea what happens to their data once that data is transmitted beyond their national jurisdictions. This article briefly reviews what happened in the 1970s, the factors that led to production of the guidelines, and some of the key points in them. We highlight the success of the guidelines, but also the shortcomings, and what is happening now to bridge the gap and ask whether an international binding convention or standard is needed. We conclude with a few modest suggestions for ensuring a new convention or standard has teeth.   In the 1970s, the decade before the OECD Guidelines were promulgated, some countries had already begun to enact privacy laws applicable to the public and private sectors. The world's first data protection law was passed in the German Land of Hessen in 1970. In 1977, a Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz or BDSG) followed. Sweden's Data Act of 1973 was the first comprehensive national act on privacy in the world. France's Data Protection Act, enacted in 1978 and amended in 2004, covers personal information held by government agencies and private entities.   In the U.S., antecedents of the 1974 Privacy Act were the American Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 and a 1973 report of the Department of Health Education and Welfare (HEW) on fair information practices (FIP).   In the seven-year stint between 1973 and 1980, one-third of the OECD's 30 Member countries enacted legislation intended to protect in dividuals against abuse of data related to them and to give individuals the right of access to data with a view to checking their accuracy and appropriateness. Some countries were enacting statutes that dealt exclusively with computers and computer-supported activities. Other countries preferred a more general approach irrespective of the particular data processing technology involved. The OECD became concerned that these disparities in legislation might \"create obstacles to the free flow of information between countries.\"   The OECD Council recognized that Member countries have a common interest in protecting privacy \"and in reconciling fundamental but competing values such as privacy and the free flow of information.\" This persisting tension between data protection and the free flow of information is already obvious in the OECD Guidelines of 1980, which were intended to facilitate a harmonization of national legislation, without precluding the establishment of an international Convention at a later date.   As it turned out, the Council of Europe (CoE), another international organization mainly concerned with the fostering of human rights and democracy in Europe, was working simultaneously in that direction---that of an international convention. As European countries began to adopt data protection laws, pressure grew for more uniformity of these laws. From a human rights perspective, the CoE began preparing an international convention on data protection that nevertheless also included provisions dealing with data processing abroad. Efforts were made to avoid unnecessary differences between the texts produced by the two organizations; thus, the set of basic principles of protection proposed by the OECD and the CoE are similar in many respects.   On Sept. 17, 1980, the Committee of Ministers of the CoE adopted the Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, the first legally binding international instrument in data protection. The convention sought to establish basic principles of data protection, to reduce restrictions on transborder data flows on the basis of reciprocity, and to bring about cooperation between national data protection authorities (DPAs). Parties to the convention are required to apply the principles in their domestic legislation.   Six days later, on Sept. 23, 1980, the OECD Council adopted its guidelines on transborder data flows. Although efforts were made to minimize the differences, some do occur nevertheless. The OECD Guidelines are not legally binding, whereas the CoE convention is binding on those countries that ratify it. The CoE convention only applies to personal data that are \"automatically\" processed, whereas the guidelines are valid for the processing of data in general, irrespective of the particular technology employed. The OECD Guidelines, unlike the CoE convention, do not mention the need to establish national data protection authorities, a crucial requirement in European data protection rules. But, all in all, the principles formulated are similar.   The OECD Guidelines and the CoE convention both recognize the need to harmonize data protection standards. Like the CoE convention, the OECD Guidelines aimed to prevent interruptions in the international flow of data, but are not to be construed as a set of general privacy protection principles per se. The guidelines explicitly say that invasions of privacy by candid photography, physical maltreatment, or defamation are outside their scope.", "authors": ["David Wright", "Paul De Hert", "Serge Gutwirth"], "n_citation": 1, "references": [], "title": "Are the OECD guidelines at 30 showing their age", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2011, "id": "6748f2c8-5b7e-490e-a358-077c7f7b14ae"}

It is too negative. History has positive experiences too. They are the ones we would like both to remember and to repeat.

{"abstract": "In Concurrent Pascal, the syntactic and semantic definition of the language prevents the inadvertent definition of a program that might violate the integrity of a shared data object. However, the language also does not allow the dynamic allocation of reusable resources among processes, and this restriction seems unnecessarily stringent. This paper proposes the addition to Concurrent Pascal of a new type of program component, to be called a resource  manager . By this means, dynamic resource allocation can be accomplished both safely and efficiently. The notion that a process holds access rights to a resource is generalized to the notion that it holds capability rights, but the capability to actually make use of a resource is granted dynamically. The anonymity of dynamically allocatable resources is also guaranteed.", "authors": ["Abraham Silberschatz", "Richard B. Kieburtz", "Arthur J.

{"abstract": "A process theory is an explanation of how an entity changes and develops. While software engineering is fundamentally concerned with how software artifacts change and develop, little research explicitly builds and empirically evaluates software engineering process theories. This lack of theory obstructs scientific consensus by focusing the academic community on methods. Methods inevitably oversimplify and over-rationalize reality, obfuscating crucial phenomena including uncertainty, problem framing and illusory requirements. Better process theories are therefore needed to ground software engineering in empirical reality. However, poor understanding of process theory issues impedes research and publication.

{"abstract": "Telecommunication protocol standards have in the past and typically still use both an English description of the protocol (sometimes also followed with a behavioural and SDL model) and an ASN.1 specification of the data-model, thus likely making the specification incomplete. ASN.1 is an ITU/ISO data definition language which has been developed to describe abstractly the values protocol data units can assume; this is of considerable interest for model checking as subtyping in ASN.1 can be used to constrain/construct the state space of the protocol accurately. However, with current practice, any change to the English description cannot easily be checked for consistency while protocols are being developed. In this work, we have developed a SPIN-based tool called EASN (Enhanced ASN.1) where the behaviour can be formally specified through a language based upon Promela for control structures but with data models from ASN.1. An attempt is also made to use international standards (X/Open std on ASN.1/C++ translation) as available so that the tool can be realised with pluggable components. One major design criterion is to enable incremental computation wherever possible (for example: hash values, consistency between alternate representations of state). We have used EASN to validate a simplified model of RLC (Radio Link Control) in the W-CDMA stack that imports data types from its associated ASN.1 model. In this paper, we discuss the motivation and design of the EASN language, the architecture and implementation of the verification tool for EASN and some preliminary performance indicators.", "authors": ["Vivek K.

In this paper, we present a continued study on modeling and control of the artificial bladder. A nonlinear dynamic model is developed for feedback control of the device. The model can be divided into two cascaded sub-models that capture net gas generation dynamics and motion dynamics, respectively. The stability analysis of motion dynamics has shown that the device with open-loop control is unstable. A dual-loop feedback control is designed to stabilize the unstable dynamics and improve the depth maneuvering accuracy. Simulation results shows that the feedback control enables the device to change its depth up to 0.2 m in one-step diving with about 50 seconds setting time. With multiple-step diving, the device can position itself at arbitrary depth underwater.", "authors": ["Zheng Chen", "Tae I.

{"abstract": "Critical information related to a software developer's current task is trapped in technical developer discussions, bug reports, code reviews, and other software artefacts. Much of this information pertains to the proper use of code elements ( e.g. , methods and classes) that capture vital problem domain knowledge. To understand the purpose of these code elements, software developers must either access documentation and online posts and understand the source code or peruse a substantial amount of text. In this paper, we use the context that surrounds code elements in StackOverflow posts to summarize the use and purpose of code elements. To provide focus to our investigation, we consider the generation of summaries for library identifiers discussed in StackOverflow. Our automatic summarization approach was evaluated on a sample of 100 randomly-selected library identifiers with respect to a benchmark of summaries provided by two annotators.

{"abstract": "We study simulation of gate circuits in algebra  C  recently introduced by Brzozowski and Esik. A transient is a word consisting of alternating 0s and 1s; it represents a changing signal. In  C , gates process transients instead of 0s and 1s.

{"abstract": "Our goal is to develop techniques for abstracting a given set of concrete programs into a program schema and for instantiating a schema to satisfy concrete specifications. For example, from two programs using the binary-search method, one to compute quotients and another to compute cube-roots, an abstract schema is derived that embodies the method and that can be instantiated to solve similar new problems.   We suggest the formulation of analogies as a basic tool in program abstraction. An analogy is first sought between the specifications of the given programs; this yields an abstract specification that may be instantiated to any of the given concrete specifications. The analogy is then used as a basis for transforming the existing programs into an abstract schema that represents the embedded technique. The invariant assertions and correctness proofs of the given programs are used to complete the analogy.", "authors": ["Nachum Dershowitz"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["10646735-cf85-495b-95cb-29d320ab23e3", "3c06651c-9719-4c32-9436-e65df8bcf15b", "7eed4ba7-ca7c-4ddd-907f-91e161a3b240", "9bda96a7-f8cf-42f2-b866-7776ce0aad2b", "b46f543a-6d73-426b-bf95-23194c5895b8", "c0c9b5bd-3a28-435b-ac30-d1aede2e3b28"], "title": "The evolution of programs: Program abstraction and instantiation", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 1981, "id": "680e6b80-6ba9-4b5a-a728-b47d583b5d79"}

{"abstract": "Coherent optical QPSK systems have attracted the attention of the research community and the Optical industry on account of features such as low power requirement and high receiver sensitivity. This can bring about a reduction in the transmitter power levels as well as the link margin to maintain a required BER. However, in order to realize a coherent detection system, the local oscillator laser needs to be synchronized with the transmitter laser diode. This can be achieved by using an optical (Phase Lock Loop) PLL at the receiver for medium data rate (Mbps). But for high data rate applications (data rates in terms of Gbps), optical PLLs are not practically realizable. In this paper, we have analyzed the use of Viterbi and Viterbi Phase Estimation Algorithm for phase synchronization. We have carried out the BER calculations and determined the BER performance degradation when compared to ideal uncoded QPSK BER performance when synchronization is not maintained. The use of Viterbi and Viterbi phase estimation algorithm brings about an improvement in BER even in the absence of an optical synchronizing arrangement. This performance improvement is further enhanced with the use of suitable error control codes. A comparison has been made between various Error Control Codes such as Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, Concatenated codes comprising of a RS and convolutional code and Low Density Parity check (LDPC) codes. We have quantified the improvement achievable with the use of these codes.", "authors": ["D. Jokhakar Jignesh", "U.

{"abstract": "In this paper we provide a novel method to deal with uncertainties in initial value problems based on solving positivity conditions, by means of semidefinite programmes and sum of squares decompositions. More specifically, given a nonlinear dynamical system with uncertainties in initial conditions and parameter values, our method provides enclosures for state trajectories. Due to the fact that we compute ellipsoids rather than boxes to estimate the enclosures, our method is less affected by conservation effects. We demonstrate the proposed method to models from biology, on the tasks of parameter estimation, model robustness and model selection. These problems that arise from biological applications are particularly challenging due to the paucity of data as well as the presence of significant data noise.

{"abstract": "Product line (PL) engineering promotes the development of  families  of related products, where individual products are differentiated by which optional features they include. Modelling and analyzing requirements models of PLs allows for early detection and correction of requirements errors -- including unintended feature interactions, which are a serious problem in feature-rich systems. A key challenge in analyzing PL requirements is the efficient verification of the product family, given that the number of products is too large to be verified one at a time. Recently, it has been shown how the high-level design of an entire PL, that includes all possible products, can be compactly represented as a single model in the SMV language, and model checked using the NuSMV tool. The implementation in NuSMV uses BDDs, a method that has been outperformed by SAT-based algorithms.   In this paper we develop PL model checking using two leading SAT-based symbolic model checking algorithms: IMC and IC3. We describe the algorithms, prove their correctness, and report on our implementation. Evaluating our methods on three PL models from the literature, we demonstrate an improvement of up to 3 orders of magnitude over the existing BDD-based method.", "authors": ["Shoham Ben-David", "Baruch Sterin", "Joanne M.

Compared to previous works, a numerical optimization approach is proposed that allows for more general heat transfer model, the consideration of the viscous friction, and system limitations in the optimization. The resulting optimal profiles are compared to other trajectories. At compression ratio of 10, the optimal profile results in 10%\u201340% increase in power density relative to other methods. Optimal geometries that trades off friction and heat transfer improvement can also be determined using this method.", "authors": ["Mohsen Saadat", "Perry Y.

{"abstract": "User interfaces in mobile applications are complex since they need to provide sufficient features to variety of users in a restricted space where a small number of components are available. When user acquires expertise in the system they expect user interfaces which satisfy their unique needs. Therefore, user interfaces in mobile applications should be adapted to different users. Since this problem exists in various applications a general solution is required to make user interfaces adaptive using user context history. In this paper, we introduce a conceptual prototype framework for mobile applications to make the user interfaces adaptive to the user. This identifies a suitable experience level to a user by learning his/her history of interactions with applications and then displays adaptive user interfaces. A proof of concept application is implemented to inspect the behavior of framework. Further, a user study was conducted on the developed proof of concept application and user context data was stored. This data was used as the training data for the Inference engine. This framework introduces an abstract solution which can be used to adapt various user interfaces based on human computer interactions.

{"abstract": "Code smells are indicators of issues with source code quality that may hinder evolution. While previous studies mainly focused on the effects of individual code smells on maintainability, we conjecture that not only the individual code smells but also the interactions between code smells affect maintenance. We empirically investigate the interactions amongst 12 code smells and analyze how those interactions relate to maintenance problems. Professional developers were hired for a period of four weeks to implement change requests on four medium-sized Java systems with known smells. On a daily basis, we recorded what specific problems they faced and which artifacts were associated with them. Code smells were automatically detected in the pre-maintenance versions of the systems and analyzed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify patterns of co-located code smells. Analysis of these factors with the observed maintenance problems revealed how smells that were co-located in the same artifact interacted with each other, and affected maintainability. Moreover, we found that code smell interactions occurred across coupled artifacts, with comparable negative effects as same-artifact co-location. We argue that future studies into the effects of code smells on maintainability should integrate dependency analysis in their process so that they can obtain a more complete understanding by including such coupled interactions.", "authors": ["Aiko Fallas Yamashita", "Leon Moonen"], "n_citation": 92, "references": ["1ad98974-dc7b-4eaa-a7d4-70768322f654", "22c9ac00-f036-4c8d-9e20-1e357ac85309", "28bedce6-c4cc-433a-b0e9-ab7bb60298f8", "29b58ca9-7e3a-4b87-93d4-8bf59379d9b0", "2e6dd115-4af8-4460-8796-b92462106156", "34726189-8503-4843-a28f-0c70bb2a9e0b", "4a1c57e7-b451-4080-9284-741f4c8bef2f", "51154562-31e0-4e9b-b1e8-95b282288abd", "61fa5706-afe3-4eba-b16c-845d9900f7ff", "6c53a09c-58b7-4195-84d8-dd3a442b9dac", "74d05ccf-7a33-4c3d-8dd7-5dbde56df22d", "78c5561b-bbc3-4ea1-af68-bd79bfe3cf48", "8da0ab7d-8cf8-412f-aa00-d98ebb6368b4", "8eda15c1-cf69-468e-8baf-59b671c2d725", "8edbd95f-9cfe-4cd6-bd13-b4f8d80edb1c", "a6f53ff4-5498-4bcb-a138-9ae192b2fbf0", "b9e8ee1d-cfe9-4d5a-a823-8a83c3abd0ff", "c0d10576-efac-436f-b182-2ff111a7e278", "c28cf51b-79cf-4b24-9234-8b304f11e6ca", "c47ad26e-8df8-4130-b80c-bda27273635b", "c6f18fa5-38c3-4934-ad8d-4e0ba59c9767", "cb2919dc-aedd-4361-99ca-c3a293e4be55", "d3fd4fe9-74cd-4911-b5e1-3ea4fabcd906", "d7318319-4aa8-4120-b368-2dd2a0b52c9c", "d8a1cb21-13ac-47c1-8ef6-13f25fa7eac7", "e4640309-5347-46d8-9214-ccfa22c5a74d"], "title": "Exploring the impact of inter-smell relations on software maintainability: an empirical study", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "6912f7bd-f385-4eb9-8d1e-60efbf570e04"}

Numerical evaluations show that energy efficiency can be improved by (i) increasing the number of uploads in the active superframe, and (ii) adopting block acknowledgement policy. It is observed that the payload size has significant impact on energy efficiency.

{"abstract": "Exception handling mechanisms are the most common model used to design and implement robust software systems. Despite their wide adoption in mainstream programming languages, empirical evidence suggests that developers are still not properly using these mechanisms to achieve better software robustness. Without adequate support, developers struggle to decide the proper manner in which they should handle their exceptions, i.e., the place where the exception should be caught and the handling actions that should be implemented. As a consequence, they tend to ignore exceptions by implementing empty handlers or leaving them unhandled, which may ultimately lead to the introduction of faults in the source code. In this context, this PhD research aims at investigating means to improve the quality of exception handling in software projects. To achieve this goal, we propose a recommender system able to support developers in implementing exception handling.", "authors": ["Eiji Adachi Barbosa"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["01e748ea-17fe-415a-8351-0e0854f035e0", "17cad5cf-eeef-440f-8e49-9a202747fe7f", "1989b23c-3190-460f-92b6-6982c861a346", "39ca808b-2c2b-4aec-a909-44e7997ebaac", "7a7abec8-ce04-4786-9f1c-3b24ab58270b", "cb191d39-0288-4263-a0f9-c63d5c673284", "d09f7451-5342-4b5a-aac6-01c4449ed097", "db776b48-b42b-480c-8efa-d1733b20a02a"], "title": "Improving exception handling with recommendations", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "695103fb-be92-40ef-9946-c18ef885174f"}

{"abstract": "Mathematical optimization algorithms are ubiquitous in computational science and engineering where the objective function of the optimization problem involves a complicated computer model predicting relevant phenomena of a scientific or engineering system of interest. Therefore, in this area of mathematical software, it is indispensable to combine software for optimization with software for simulation, typically developed independently of each other by members of separate scientific communities. From a software engineering point of view, the situation becomes even more challenging when the simulation software is developed using a parallel programming paradigm without taking into consideration that it will be executed within an optimization context. The EFCOSS environment alleviates some of the problems by serving as an interfacing layer between optimization software and simulation software. In this paper, we show the software design of those parts of EFCOSS that are relevant to the integration of a simulation software involving different parallel programming paradigms. The parallel programming paradigms supported by EFCOSS include MPI for distributed memory and OpenMP for shared memory. In addition, the simulation software can be executed on a remote parallel computer.", "authors": ["Ralf Seidler", "H. Martin B\u00fccker", "M.

{"abstract": "The idea of synthesizing statecharts out of a collection of scenarios has received a lot of attention in recent years. However due to the poor expressive power of first generation scenario languages, including UML 1.x sequence diagrams, the proposed solutions often use ad hoc tricks and suffer from many shortcomings. The recent adoption in UML 2.0 of a richer scenario language, including interesting composition operators, now makes it possible to revisit the problem of statechart synthesis with a radically new approach. Inspired by the way UML 2.0 sequence diagrams can be algebraically composed, we first define an algebraic framework for composing statecharts. Then we show how to leverage the algebraic structure of UML 2.0 sequence diagrams to get a direct algorithm for synthesizing a composition of statecharts out of them. The synthesized statecharts exhibit interesting properties that make them particularly useful as a basis for the detailed design process. Beyond offering a systematic and semantically well founded method, another interest of our approach lies in its flexibility: the modification or replacement of a given scenario has a limited impact on the synthesis process, thus fostering a better traceability between the requirements and the detailed design.", "authors": ["Tewfic Ziadi", "Lo\u00efc H\u00e9lou\u00ebt", "Jean-Marc J\u00e9z\u00e9quel"], "n_citation": 93, "references": ["0d261b6a-c94a-4d5e-b44e-eb6ae46581fc", "15a2d332-783d-4a0e-900c-faadda3c080c", "2b52fcaa-6133-43fb-b12f-d277e0e6cd66", "39c72c08-2556-45fa-9963-aca832fe0f34", "4b69848f-c29d-4858-b5eb-b3de50ec3e1b", "5bb50329-29c2-45aa-80cd-b6c0b22aab37", "607c01a1-6f12-4c35-b796-9886598ea47a", "936d377c-496c-4543-9fd8-718e76412db0", "b3037b6c-bddd-4733-a1cc-db7a024adb56", "d98f9f8c-bda6-4a13-bc9d-fb47515560f2", "dcee2770-50ff-4823-9df8-e877ce3d7ab2", "e5c2e303-c14d-46d8-a0c2-2a6117156523"], "title": "Revisiting statechart synthesis with an algebraic approach", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2004, "id": "698fb75d-9711-41db-83db-caf2bfdcb4d8"}
{"abstract": "An earlier work on automated optimization heuristics for cryptanalysis of classical ciphers proposed a few algorithms for that task (e.g. genetic, simulated annealing, tabu search). A Java-language open-source Cryptolysis project has implemented these algorithms for verification and comparison purposes in a consistent frameworked environment allowing for additional algorithms. Another Java-language open-source project, MARF, has collected a number of frameworked classification algorithms (e.g. distance, neural network, similarity measure, etc.). We extend Cryptolysis with the wrappers for the algorithms implemented in MARF to add to the heuristics collection new results and compare them with the previously implemented algorithms. Conversely, we improve MARF's implementation by porting the Cryptolysis's implementations of search algorithms for various classification tasks in natural language and others. Additionally, we improve the system with the natural language word segmentation for the deciphered text corpora that lacks spacing and punctuation. As a result this work we validate the software architecture and design used in both frameworks as a sustainable and correct approach and practice that should be followed and re-enforced for such frameworks.", "authors": ["Serguei A.

Using the tuneable NKC model of multi-agent evolution it is shown that the benefits of simple recombination and mutation vary depending on the type of system, with bit mutation capable of doing as well as recombination in systems with significant inter-agent epistasis. The effects of fitness sharing between the interacting individuals are then examined and it is shown that mutation can do as well as, or better than, recombination even under low inter-agent epistasis; fitness sharing is shown to alter the characteristics of the coevolving system.", "authors": ["Larry Bull"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["10c0d4b4-7b8f-4b2b-bf76-d3af9593ca60", "23098ec9-a633-4f1d-9889-d6004258f40d", "6a6f283e-6faa-42a3-85a7-6848d7d1f8d4", "9e6c96b0-02ee-4a8e-8d3f-347f353d3a57", "f62fea69-3649-43b0-8421-035fafa174af"], "title": "Evolutionary Computing in Multi-agent Environments: Operators", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "year": 1998, "id": "69a32494-2793-4f55-88bd-d2dc9ae16ec6"}

For efficient Network Intrusion Detection System the preprocessing is most essential. In order to preprocess the dataset Support Vector Machine algorithm is used and that gives the new data model which has been used for creating rules for misuse detection. The dataset can be classified into two datasets; namely positive kernel and negative kernel. Positive Kernel is used for creating the rules. After classifying the dataset, fuzzification is applied to that datset and then the rules has been created by Genetic Network Programming which based on direct graph structure. In the testing phase the system has been used to detect the misuse activities.

{"abstract": "The idea of crowdsourcing tasks in software engineering, especially software testing, has gained popularity in recent years. Crowdsourcing testing and educational projects are natural complementary. One of the challenges of crowdsourcing testing is to find a number of qualified workers with low cost. Students in software engineering are suitable candidates for crowdsourcing testing. On the other hand, practical projects play a key role in software engineering education. In order to enhance educational project outcomes and achieve industrial-strength training, we need to provide the opportunity for students to be exposed to commercial software development.     In this paper, we report a preliminary study on crowdsourcing testing for educational projects. We introduce three commercial software products as educational testing projects, which are crowdsourced by our teaching support system. We call this \"Quasi-Crowdsourcing Test\" (QCT) because the candidate workers are students, who have certain social relations. The investigation results are encouraging and show to be beneficial to both the students and industry in QCT projects.", "authors": ["Zhenyu Chen", "Bin Luo"], "n_citation": 11, "references": ["0cdd99ec-6f71-48c2-a830-581a84741064", "132ef506-c3de-4603-bb70-c8d7cba88867", "76922192-2ed0-444a-a23a-d108ceed4647", "79c155e5-a8d9-4f6b-bb37-8789443ceaef", "a09b9bc5-a653-46c7-9f2b-d4509b4449f3", "fd372d2a-637d-4a13-a371-95c4aebd657e"], "title": "Quasi-crowdsourcing testing for educational projects", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "6a382e6a-be2a-4eec-838c-95d1d233a642"}

{"abstract": "Student involvement in Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) holds the potential to support a wide range software engineering education topics from requirements to design to testing and more. In addition, participation in a FOSS project exposes students to large, complex software projects and real-world development teams and environments like those that they will typically see after graduation. However, identifying a project appropriate for student involvement can be a difficult task. There are a huge number of possible FOSS projects with a wide range of sizes, complexity, and domains. The presenters of this workshop have developed an approach to FOSS project identification [1] which is based on several years of experience with student participation in FOSS projects. The approach is based on humanitarian FOSS (HFOSS) as those projects have been shown to motivate students [2]. During the workshop, key criteria for evaluating a FOSS project will be presented, along with a rubric.

{"abstract": "The quadcode is a hierarchical data structure for describing digital images. It has the following properties: (1) straightforward representation of dimension, size, and the relationship between an image and its subsets; (2) explicit description of geometric properties, such as location, distance, and adjacency; and (3) ease of conversion from and to raster representation. The quadcode has applications to computer graphics and image processing because of its ability to focus on selected subsets of the data and to allow utilization of multiple resolutions in different parts of the image. A related approach is the quadtree. Samet recently presented a thorough survey of the literature in that field  [ 7 ].  Gargantini  [ 2 ]  and Abel and Smith  [ 1 ]  presented linear quadtrees and linear locational keys that are efficient labeling techniques for quadtrees. In those papers the geometric concepts of the image are discussed by using the tree as an interpretive medium, and the approaches and procedures are based on traversal of the nodes in the tree. In this paper we present the quadcode system, which is a direct description of the image, and discuss the geometric concepts in terms of the coded images themselves.", "authors": ["Shuxiang Li", "Murray H.

We apply an iterative loop-shaping technique to design a compensator which avoids the areas of the CRCBode plot with performance index greater than zero, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique for flow-rate control of a dynamic nonlinear butterfly valve system. Finally we verify the performance of the compensated system via simulation.", "authors": ["J. D. Taylor", "Iacopo Gentilini", "William C.

Four timedomain GGM assessment methods for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems are provided, and the GGM equivalence between linear and NL systems, for both time-invariant and time-varying cases, at the equilibrium point is established, which makes it possible to develop GGM assessment methods for NL systems in the subsequent investigation using the corresponding GGM estimating methods for linear systems. However, unlike the linear systems, the GGM of the NL system may be reduced when the size of Domain of Attraction (DOA) is imposed, which is shown by examples.

{"abstract": "This paper considers a notion of QSR dissipativity for discrete-time switched systems that uses multiple supply rates. The focus on switched systems is motivated by cyber physical systems (CPS) where physical dynamics interact with discrete-event or logical dynamics. The notion of QSR dissipa-tivity used in this paper is based on previous work on QSR dissipativity for non-switched systems and decomposable dissi-pativity for switched systems. The notion of QSR dissipativity is well established for non-switched systems and generalizes many system results including both the passivity theorem and the small gain theorem. In decomposable dissipativity, separate supply rates are developed for each subsystem depending on whether it is currently active or inactive. This paper presents this definition of QSR dissipativity for switched systems and then uses it to prove stability for single systems and interconnected systems. Beyond stability, the dissipative property for interconnected systems is shown. This allows for large scale systems to be studied using successive dissipative assessments. When considering passive systems, these results are studied in more detail.", "authors": ["Michael J. McCourt", "Panos J.

{"abstract": "A Nonlinear Model Predictive Controller (NMPC) for trajectory tracking of surface vessels is presented. NMPC calculates the future control inputs based on the present state variables by optimizing a cost function. The fact that cost function incorporates input constraints as well as state errors in determining the control inputs is exploited. This method can be applied to all systems with input saturation. NMPC formulation and derivation of input constraints are presented. Here the controller is designed based on a 3 DOF nonlinear dynamic model of the vessel. The performance of the controller is demonstrated by simulations. A constant speed sine trajectory is defined as desired path and the simulation results for input saturation case show the control inputs (propeller speed and rudder angle of the vessel) remain within the saturation limits in extreme maneuvers, the vessel recovers from saturation, and the vessels follows the trajectory very closely when the inputs are not saturated.", "authors": ["Yaswanth Siramdasu", "Farbod Fahimi"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["2c4a7a4f-70ca-49ef-a01d-32e80fa041d8", "4d814af4-f8d4-4077-a4f4-3ec2538924de", "6142f0a8-8837-40bc-a190-ce30fa9c4903", "646860a7-62c0-450e-a6b6-bfabc6aab054", "8fc6c41e-7327-4ebd-acf9-df287ebad695", "baed3bd2-d772-4fbe-86b2-6aba28c82025"], "title": "Incorporating input saturation for underactuated surface vessel trajectory tracking control", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "6aa885a0-d3e8-4242-bc26-0e204344457f"}

{"abstract": "The generalized Prandtl-Ishlinskii model (GPI) of hysteresis has a wide applicability, partly because of its capability of modelling highly asymmetric hysteresis. A disadvantage of the GPI models compared to, for example the Modified Prandtl-Ishlinskii models, has been that they have had to be identified using parametric non convex methods. Recently though, a method for non-parametric convex identification for an extended and more general GPI model was described, giving all model functions. Here, the method, which was based on input discrete equations, is briefly presented in terms of the corresponding input continuous equations. This extended model corresponds to a Preisach model and an explicit expression for this relation is derived. The method is directly applicable to data consisting of first order reversal curves, but in an application to an electrical substation equipment, it is shown that other kinds of data can also be used. The method gives significantly closer fit to this data than previous studies, and it demonstrates that non-equal left and right envelope functions are optimal.", "authors": ["Marcus Hedeg\u00e4rd", "Torsten Wik"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["9e37cc15-8087-48df-9d25-cbae901af3b5"], "title": "Convex identification of models for asymmetric hysteresis", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2014, "id": "6ac5b89b-84b6-4387-81ad-3aba2c10942d"}

Our statistical analysis reveals, most notably, that: functional and scripting languages are more concise than procedural and object-oriented languages, C is hard to beat when it comes to raw speed on large inputs, but performance differences over inputs of moderate size are less pronounced and allow even interpreted languages to be competitive, compiled strongly-typed languages, where more defects can be caught at compile time, are less prone to runtime failures than interpreted or weakly-typed languages.

{"abstract": "We present a general model of software development environments that consists of three components: policies, mechanisms and structures. The advantage of this formalization is that it distinguishes precisely those aspects of an environment that are useful in comparing and contrasting software development environments. We introduce four classes of models by means of a sociological metaphor that emphasizes scale: the individual, the family, the city and the state models. The utility of this taxonomy is that it delineates the important classes of interaction among software developers and exposes the ways in which current software development environments inadequately support the development of large systems.  Environments reflecting the individual and family models are the current state of the art. Unfortunately, these two models are ill-suited for the development of large systems that require more than, say, 20 programmers. We argue that there is a qualitative difference between the interactions among a small, \u201cfamily\u201d project and a large, \u201ccity\u201d project and that this qualitative difference requires a fundamentally different model of software development environments.

The identification includes basically codes for a matrix of descriptors, an entry number, and the kind, major interest, and source of the reference. The identification also provides a choice to identify material for personal as well as general files.

This paper presents a set of mutually consistent philosophies regarding code extension applications, and suggests a corollary set of doctrines for the application of the code extension characters.

{"abstract": "The substantial differences in characteristics of random access storage and tape devices dictate that concepts and objectives of computer program design be considered from the viewpoint of the external file medium used. This is particularly true in the case of sorting. In a tape-oriented system, the major sorting problem is that of minimizing merge time despite the limited orders of merge possible. In contrast, sorting in a random access-oriented system encourages the selection of the optimum order of merge from many possible orders. The latter problem is discussed in this paper, along with criteria developed for determining the optimum order of merge according to the various properties of random access storage devices. Attention is also given to the problem of key sorting versus record sorting and the possibly serious disadvantage of key sorting on a random access system.", "authors": ["George U.

{"abstract": "As a practical opportunity for educating Japanese young developers in the field of embedded software development, a software design contest involving the design of software to automatically control a line-trace robot, and conduct running performance tests was held. In this paper,we give the results of the contest from the viewpoint of software quality evaluation. We create a framework for evaluating the software quality which integrated design model quality and the final system performance, and conduct analysis using the framework. As a result of analysis,it is found that the quantitative measurement of the structural complexity of the design models bears a strong relationship to qualitative evaluation of the design conducted by judges. It is also found that there is no strong correlation between design model quality evaluated by the judges and the final system performance. For embedded software development, it is particularly important to estimate and verify reliability and performance in the early stages,using the model. Based on the analysis result,we consider possible remedies with respect to the models submitted,the evaluation methods used and the contest specifications.

These controllers based on the token ring architecture, are planned to be reconfigurable according to user requirements, and should be automatically adapted at run-time to their environment. A reconfiguration scenario is assumed to be any run-time automatic addition/removal/update of OS periodic tasks to/from different STM32F4 microcontrollers. Nevertheless, if simultaneous and concurrent scenarios appear in different controllers, then we can get unpredictable critical behaviors of the whole distributed system. A multi-agent architecture is defined where Request and Coordination Agents are assigned to each microcontroller to handle local reconfiguration scenarios after coordination with remote controllers. A tool is developed to simulate a real-case study.

{"abstract": "GitHub projects attract contributions from a community of users with varying coding and quality assurance skills. Developers on GitHub feel a need for automated tests and rely on test suites for regression testing and continuous integration. However, project owners report to often struggle with implementing an exhaustive test suite. Convincing contributors to provide automated test cases remains a challenge. The absence of an adequate test suite or using tests of low quality can degrade the quality of the software product. We present an approach for reducing the effort required by project owners for extending their test suites. We aim to utilize the phenomenon of drive-by commits: capable users quickly and easily solve problems in others' projects - even though they are not particularly involved in that project - and move on. By analyzing and directing the drive-by commit phenomenon, we hope to use crowdsourcing to improve projects' quality assurance efforts.

{"abstract": "It is our great pleasure to welcome you to the Experience Reports Track of  the 27th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) . The objective of the Experience Reports Track is to establish a dialogue between software practitioners and software engineering researchers on the benefits, obstacles, and weaknesses of applying software engineering principles, techniques, methods, processes, and tools in an industrial or organizational setting. In the call for papers, we invited four types of submissions: case studies, experience reports, experimental reports and problem statements. The call attracted 72 submissions from all over the world. The program committee of the Experience Reports Track accepted 14 submissions. The selection was based on at least three reviews per submission and the results of intensive consensus discussions prior to and during the Experience Reports Track program committee meeting, held on November 12, 2004 in Essen, Germany.The accepted papers of the  ICSE 2005  Experience Reports Track cover topics such as agile methods, product lines, requirements engineering, software architecture, testing and verification.

{"abstract": "Software deployment is an evolving collection of interrelated processes such as release, install, adapt, reconfigure, update, activate, deactivate, remove, and retire. The connectivity of large networks, such as the Internet, is affecting how software deployment is performed. It is necessary to introduce new software deployment technologies that leverage this connectivity. The Software Dock framework creates a distributed, agent based deployment framework to support the ongoing cooperation and negotiation among software producers themselves and among software producers and software consumers. This deployment framework is enabled by the use of a standardized deployment schema for describing software systems, called the Deployable Software Description (DSD) format. The Software Dock also employs agents to traverse between software producers and consumers in order to perform software deployment activities by interpreting the descriptions of software systems. The Software Dock infrastructure allows software producers to offer their customers high level deployment services that were previously not possible.", "authors": ["Richard S.

{"abstract": "The initial version of IPL-V for the Philco 2000 has been completed and is now operating on the computer. This model, IPLT-1, contains the loader, interpreter, output, housekeeping functions, and some of the primitives of the 7090 version.  This system was written mainly in JOVIAL, a procedure-oriented language, and was compiled to produce a Philco TAC binary operating deck. Certain portions were written in Philco TAC language to speed up the operation of the system during execution and to facilitate handling of primitives which in JOVIAL would have been uneconomical. These assembly-language coded sections constitute less than 3 percent of the system.  The present model assembles IPL program cards at the rate of 500 per minute in the listing mode. This compares favorably with the 7090 model, since System Development Corporation's configuration of the Philco computer operates at approximately one-fifth the speed of the 7090. Interpretation time also compares favorably with the 7090 model taking into account the difference in speeds of the two computers. The package of J primitives produced by H. A. Simon is being used and assembled with the IPL program. With listing suppressed, assembly time of these routines is only a few seconds. Input to the Philco 2000 is by card, and the system operates as a program executed in phase three of the SL Philco operating system. The J165, J166 dump and reload features are working, and this technique can be used to save an assembled IPL program on tape for later use. Unused region assignments are not returned to available space; therefore additional routines may be added with new data for reload and run from a dump tape. However, card input is extremely fast (2000 cards per minute) and normal operating procedure at SDC is card input.", "authors": ["Stuart S.

{"abstract": "Small UAVs are currently used in several monitoring applications to monitor a set of targets and collect relevant data. One of the main constraints that characterize a small UAV is the maximum amount of fuel the vehicle carry. In this article, we consider a single UAV routing problem where there are multiple depots and the vehicle is allowed to refuel at any depot. The objective of the problem is to find a path for the UAV such that each target is visited at least once by the vehicle, the fuel constraint is never violated along the path for the UAV, and the total cost of the edges present in the path is a minimum. We first develop a mixed integer, linear programming formulation to solve the problem optimally. We also propose fast and efficient construction and improvement heuristics to solve the same.

{"abstract": "We perform a Hamiltonian reduction of spherically symmetric Einstein gravity with a thin dust shell of positive rest mass. Three spatial topologies are considered: Euclidean $({R}^{3})$, Kruskal ${(S}^{2}\\ifmmode\\times\\else\\texttimes\\fi{}R)$, and the spatial topology of a diametrically identified Kruskal $({\\mathrm{RP}}^{3}\\$ ${$a point at infinity$})$. For the Kruskal and ${\\mathrm{RP}}^{3}$ topologies the reduced phase space is four dimensional, with one canonical pair associated with the shell and the other with the geometry; the latter pair disappears if one prescribes the value of the Schwarzschild mass at an asymptopia or at a throat. For the Euclidean topology the reduced phase space is necessarily two dimensional, with only the canonical pair associated with the shell surviving. A time reparametrization on a two-dimensional phase space is introduced and used to bring the shell Hamiltonians to a simpler (and known) form associated with the proper time of the shell. An alternative reparametrization yields a square-root Hamiltonian that generalizes the Hamiltonian of a test shell in Minkowski space with respect to Minkowski time. Quantization is briefly discussed. The discrete mass spectrum that characterizes natural minisuperspace quantizations of vacuum wormholes and ${\\mathrm{RP}}^{3}$ geons appears to persist as the geometrical part of the mass spectrum when the additional matter degree of freedom is added.", "authors": ["Jeff Johnson", "Bonnie A.

{"abstract": "In current machine designs, a machine address gives the user direct access to a single piece of information, namely the contents of that machine word. This note is based on the observation that it is often useful to associate additional information, with some (relatively few) address locations determined at run time, without the necessity of preallocating the storage at all possible such addresses. That is, it can be useful to have an effective extra bit, field, or address in some words without every word having to contain a bit (or bits) to mark this as a special case. The key idea is that this extra associated information can be found by a table search. Although it could be found by any search technique (e.g. linear, binary sorted, etc.), we suggest that an appropriate low overhead mechanism is to use hash search on a table in which the key is the address of the cell to be augmented.", "authors": ["Daniel G.

The focus of this paper is the co-design of hybrid communication protocol and adaptive switching control that enables stabilization of multiple control applications using minimal communication resources. The hybrid protocol chosen is one that switches between time-triggered and event-triggered methods in order to realize their combined advantages. A control algorithm is co-designed along with this hybrid protocol so as to exploit the properties of the individual protocols as well as the switches between them.

{"abstract": "Wireless sensor network (WSN) consists of tiny sensor nodes with sensing, computation and wireless communication capabilities. These nodes are usually small in size with limited processing power, limited memory and limited energy source. The sensor node captures information which is very critical in nature. Due to this reliable communication is expected. For end to end reliability ACK/NACK packets are used at transport layer and recovery of lost data packets is done by retransmission which leads to congestion. So WSN applications require a congestion control mechanism to regulate the amount of traffic injected within the WSN to avoid packet loss and to guarantee end-to-end reliable packet delivery. Unless the congestion is detected and an appropriate avoidance technique is adopted, a significant amount of packet loss takes place. This further necessitates packet retransmission and causes a significant amount of energy loss. Therefore, energy management in each node is a very critical issue that deeply affects the system design. So energy efficient protocols are expected at every layer. Diversity Coded Directed Diffusion protocol uses secondary receivers i.e. Prongs for energy efficient transmission. Long observation is fragmented. Each fragment takes different path to sink via prongs which conserves energy consumption. Reliability is achieved using encoding and decoding.", "authors": ["G. N.

Small scale testing was already conducted manually by other teams and unit testing was conducted on individual functions. However, there was still a need for full scale acceptance testing on a broad scale.   We describe how we addressed this testing problem by applying the idea of metamorphic testing [1].

{"abstract": "This paper presents a switched control strategy for the robust stabilization of uncertain nonlinear process systems with both control and measurement sampling constraints. A model-based constrained Lyapunov-based controller is initially designed for each control actuator configuration. Next, the constrained stability regions and the terminal sets of all the configurations are characterized, in terms of the size of the control constraints, the sampling period and the plant-model mismatch, and analyzed. The analysis shows that the configuration with the largest stability region does not necessarily have the smallest terminal set, which leads to a conflict with the desired control objective of steering the process from a large initial state to a small terminal neighborhood of the equilibrium point. To resolve this conflict and attain the desired control objective, a switching strategy that executes a sequence of transitions between the available actuator configurations is developed. The key idea of the switching logic is to keep a configuration active until its terminal set is reached and then to switch to another stabilizing configuration with a smaller terminal set. The proposed robust hybrid control method is illustrated using a chemical process example.", "authors": ["Ye Hu", "Nael H.

{"abstract": "This study investigates a mathematical modeling approach to the formulation of treatment strategies for rapid-progressors to AIDS (RPs), who experience a considerably faster progression than other patients and constitute approximately 10% of the infected population. This presents a first attempt to produce optimal schedules for rapid-progressors, as this has not been considered in the literature to-date. A previously formulated model for typical-progressors was modified to predict the entire trajectory of the disease in RPs by estimation of immune system parameters only. The latter have been suggested to be key in determining the degree of progression and the ability of the model to reproduce this phenomenon via replication of clinical data from this class of patients validates the formulation. Moreover, the model also replicates clinical data from long-term non-progressors (LTNPs) and this further validates this work. Our optimal control results have shown that, unlike continuous therapy, which is not effective in controlling disease progression in RPs, structured treatment interruptions (STIs) prove to be very effective. This work reinforces their promising potential and should encourage further experimental and clinical work to examine their inclusion in HIV treatment guidelines.", "authors": ["Marios M.

{"abstract": "A basic concern when considering a programming cost estimate is its reasonableness. A statistical examination of over thirty completed products was conducted, using least square error methods, to develop an improved method for establishing a central value and an acceptable range of values for programming product cost estimates. Eight variables associated with the coding process, such as the number of lines of new and modified Basic Assembler Language and number of new modules, were found to be useful in developing reasonableness equations. Using regression equations developed from the variables, we developed reasonableness tests that compare the estimate prepared by the developer to the actual development effort applied to previous products.   Insight also was gained about programmer productivity, the quality of code estimations, and the optimum number of lines of code per module.   Estimates are usually based on the experience of the past. But whatever method is used, the main consideration is the error of estimate associated with that method. The basic question about any estimate is: how good is it?   The current state of the art of the cost estimating of software projects evolved from the works of Walverton 1  attempting to correlate the size of effort in person-months with the size of the product expressed in Thousand Lines of Source Code (KLOC). Large dispersion of data forced Walston and Felix 2  to take into account additional variables such as programmer experience and the complexity of the application as well as over twenty variables. Putnam 3  simplified staffing (life cycle curve) to a small and easily managed set of parameters that could be expressed in the form of nomograms.   This paper contributes to the software cost estimation by identifying those variables of the product which were found to be governing: The importance of distinguishing higher level language Programming Language Systems (PLS) from low level Basic Assembler Language (BAL), the importance of recognizing the major increase of effort if code is modified rather than new code created. The magnitude of these differences is quantified. Finally in the analysis of the optional number of modules for a product, a balance is shown between the intramodule complexity and the intermodule complexity.   Parametric data associated with program product development costs has been actively collected since mid-1976 by the Program Cost Estimating Department, now located at IBM's Santa Teresa Laboratory. This data represents the actual person-month resources used to match program development requirements.   Products that were analyzed are a collection of classic IBM mainframe products: languages (such as Cobol, PL/I, APL), utilities (VSAM, OS utilities, sort, etc.), and data base products (IMS, Data Dictionary, etc.). These are \u201csystem programs\u201d rather than applications. The range and median sizes of the products are shown in Table 1. Twenty six of the thirty products contain modified modules.", "authors": ["Robert E.

{"abstract": "Computer scientists have long believed that software is different from physical systems in one fundamental way: while the latter have continuous dynamics, the former do not. In this paper, we argue that notions of continuity from mathematical analysis are relevant and interesting even for software. First, we demonstrate that many everyday programs are  continuous  (i.e., arbitrarily small changes to their inputs only cause arbitrarily small changes to their outputs) or  Lipschitz continuous  (i.e., when their inputs change, their outputs change at most proportionally). Second, we give an mostly-automatic framework for verifying that a program is continuous or Lipschitz, showing that traditional, discrete approaches to proving programs correct can be extended to reason about these properties.

{"abstract": "Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) is among the most influential theories of health behavior and has been used as the conceptual basis of interventions for smoking cessation, weight management, and other related health outcomes. SCT and other related theories were developed primarily to explain differences between individuals, but explanatory theories of within-person behavioral variability are increasingly needed to support new technology-driven interventions that can adapt over time for each person. This paper describes a dynamical system model of SCT using a fluid analogy scheme. A series of simulations were performed to explore and better understand SCT. The model incorporates a nonlinear feature called habituation, an impor- tant feature of behavioral response resulting from continuous stimulus. It also illustrates how control systems engineering principles provide a promising approach for advancing health behavior theory development, and for guiding the design of more potent and efficient effective interventions.", "authors": ["Cesar A.

{"abstract": "Active Noise Control can provide damping of low-frequency noise in car compartments by feedforward or feedback control. The complicated sound field in reverberant environments limits the spatial volume of efficient sound control. At higher frequencies, damping is in general possible only within a small volume around a control microphone when using a single loudspeaker to produce the control signal. We here investigate how the spatial volume of control, as well as the upper limiting frequency, can be increased by using MIMO feedforward control that uses all loudspeakers of a premium car HiFi system. The results indicate that performance is improved for narrowband as well as broadband noise, resulting in a considerable noise reduction within a 0.3 \u00d7 0.3 m area. Compared to a corresponding SISO design that uses one loudspeaker and is optimized for one measurement position, the measured noise damping is improved and the upper limit frequency for control over the whole area is more than doubled, from 200 Hz to 450 Hz. The design requires high-precision identification of acoustic transfer functions from all involved loudspeakers as well as accurate modeling of noise paths.", "authors": ["Simon Berthilsson", "Annea Barkefors", "Mikael Sternad"], "n_citation": 10, "references": ["2eb50edb-41d7-4802-93a6-6077d70f16d5", "5dfe4183-0385-4d91-ae42-d916f0d6f626", "be97110e-bf88-4cca-9378-a1a8d648f5b2", "ec35cec0-beaa-47cd-9674-bbfc7f9c89dd"], "title": "MIMO design of Active Noise Controllers for car interiors: Extending the silenced region at higher frequencies", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "6cc4634f-66e6-4e79-a7a3-4591a16ccfc6"}

{"abstract": "Abstract : Automated program transformation systems are emerging as the basis for a new programming methodology in which high-level, understandable specifications are transformed into efficient programs. Subsequent modification of the original specification will be dealt with by reimplementation of the specification. For such a system to be practical, these reimplementations must occur relatively quickly and reliably, in comparison with the original implementation. We believe the reimplementation requirement necessitates that a formal document--the program development--be constructed during the development process to explain the resulting implementation to future maintainters of the specification. The overall goal of our work has been to develop a language for capturing and explaining these developments and the resulting implementations. This language must be capable of expressing: the implementor's goal structure, all program manipulations necessary for implementation and optimization, and plans of such optimizations. In this report, we discuss the documentation requirements of the development process and then describe a prototype system for constructing and maintaining this documentation information. Finally, we indicate the many remaining open issues and the direction to be taken in the pursuit of solutions. (Author)", "authors": ["David S.

{"abstract": "In this paper, stochastic optimal control design has been considered for linear networked control system (NCS) in the presence of network imperfections such as packet losses and random delays. For evaluating the impact of network reliability on controller performance, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is considered with NCS. With uncertain system dynamics and unknown network imperfections, proposed stochastic optimal approach, referred to as adaptive dynamics programming (ADP), uses a novel observer and value function estimator to solve the state estimation and infinite horizon optimal regulation of NCS with the TCP protocol. Update laws for tuning the unknown parameters of novel observer and estimator are derived. Stability region of the linear NCS with and without the adaptive observer is given. Lyapunov theory is used to show that all signals are asymptotically stable (AS) in the mean and the estimated control and observed state signals converge to optimal control inputs and actual states of NCS respectively.

{"abstract": "Recent advances in program repair techniques have raised the possibility of patching bugs automatically. For an automatically generated patch to be accepted by developers, it should not only resolve the bug but also satisfy certain human-related factors including readability and comprehensibility. In this paper, we focus on the simplicity of patches (the size of changes). We present a novel semantics-based repair method that generates the simplest patch such that the program structure of the buggy program is maximally preserved. To take into account the simplicity of repairs in an efficient way (i.e., Without explicitly enumerating each repair candidate for each fault location), our method fuses fault localization and repair generation into one step. We do so by leveraging partial Max SAT constraint solving and component-based program synthesis. We compare our prototype implementation, Direct Fix, with the state-of-the-art semantics-based repair tool Sem Fix, that performs fault localization before repair generation. In our experiments with SIR programs and GNU Coreutils, Direct Fix generates repairs that are simpler than those generated by Sem Fix. Since both Direct Fix and Sem Fix are test-driven repair tools, they can introduce regressions for other tests which do not drive the repair. We found that Direct Fix causes substantially less regression errors than Sem Fix.", "authors": ["Sergey Mechtaev", "Jooyong Yi", "Abhik Roychoudhury"], "n_citation": 100, "references": ["021be84c-7bd9-451d-810b-7f80545fa9a7", "0278bce3-e509-4ae6-b130-87a283a4b819", "054a21ee-f1b1-4bc5-8084-0bebb69273bd", "0e45f88a-91b4-412d-96bb-96aa7f21e89b", "0ed73fc7-0a43-4035-baeb-2ae130c184d5", "10cfb399-5a03-4300-baa2-0df8ea0706cc", "1b9ef13c-1528-4484-abfd-5d26dda7663b", "2268d4cf-b284-4e25-9a80-b92dc52daa19", "26ce4c85-47b9-4dfb-857f-81b2b6925603", "27f6f4fc-f788-4ec8-8281-0dd4ed400fc0", "496dc190-3e20-41e6-9946-3247256c41ed", "53ce6ee3-31f1-48ca-9881-f82209a2f949", "5b4b8a03-db88-45dd-ba8b-1b57f6fb4f9e", "65d031b9-2a84-43d9-a23a-300bcccad40d", "65da1b5f-65e8-41e3-b0ae-b1a162e37747", "6c53d105-48f2-4ebe-b2eb-406dacc99be1", "71b90a90-d12d-4c30-984b-7ede24999b0a", "71c47dd0-a7ff-4b97-a640-1186dd9ac968", "76b9774a-c0ff-48ef-9378-8b70ca6d5be2", "82a1eadd-c3c9-4a65-854a-1d0e4c52c2d4", "82b8c3ee-6502-47fb-9d26-4d683413b70b", "88fd33d0-7d31-4f84-ac49-4111a0754b68", "92490cb9-dc24-442a-878a-cfdc0aa0bef9", "93d5fb9e-cec8-442f-8152-bc8c29813a3d", "9605cfe5-3c12-4020-825e-d265af17b219", "9fd310d2-e15e-4573-bcfe-69bdbca70ca5", "a37c8220-d24d-4a93-95da-b96bb53e1835", "a4ee080c-bd84-4085-9958-5a4b2fb41bd4", "a551bb2a-8f29-4e01-b4b4-a0d1befa7a53", "c7dda81c-0759-4906-9b8c-dc02aafacb05", "c9cd1803-6539-4768-9315-7b07c40701d8", "db6f9232-df5a-4a76-bad2-a892b9402554", "ddc4dea3-a9f4-4a19-9e43-d28977f675ac", "df05bdcb-c3aa-4b5b-ac97-840897958c54", "e8741b19-696d-4f8d-9458-ce26cdd11103", "e9dbfc68-2565-4369-9729-799ac87f2402"], "title": "DirectFix: looking for simple program repairs", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "6cfe2cef-14ba-4b03-9b11-2f11c1e4f717"}

{"abstract": "The amount and impact of software-dependence in critical systems impinging on daily life is increasing rapidly. In many of these systems, inadequate software and systems engineering can lead to economic disaster, injuries or death. Society generally does not recognize the potential of losses from deficiencies of systems due to software until after some mishap occurs. Then there is an outcry, reflecting societal expectations; however, few know what it takes to achieve the expected safety and, in general, loss-prevention.     On the one hand there are unprecedented, exponential increases in size, inter-dependencies, intricacies, numbers and variety in the systems and distribution of development processes across organizations and cultures. On the other hand, industry's capability to verify and validate these systems has not kept up. Mere compliance with existing standards, techniques, and regulations cannot guarantee the safety properties of these systems. The gap between practice and capability is increasing rapidly.     This paper considers the future of software engineering as needed to support development and certification of safety-critical software-dependent systems.

{"abstract": "Process mining is to extract knowledge about business processes from data stored implicitly in ad-hoc way or explicitly by information systems. The aim is to discover runtime process, analyze performance and perform conformance verification, using process mining tools like ProM and Disco, for single software repository and processes spanning across multiple repositories. Application of process mining to software repositories has recently gained interest due to availability of vast data generated during software development and maintenance. Process data are embodied in repositories which can be used for analysis to improve the efficiency and capability of process, however, involves a lot of challenges which have not been addressed so far. Project team defines workflow, design process and policies for tasks like issue tracking (defect or feature enhancement), peer code review (review the submitted patch to avoid defects before they are injected) etc. to streamline and structure the activities. The reality may not be the same as defined because of imperfections so the extent of non-conformance needs to be measured. We propose a research framework `Nirikshan' to process mine the data of software repositories from multiple perspectives like process, organizational, data and time. We apply process mining on software repositories to derive runtime process map, identify and remove inefficiencies and imperfections, extend the capabilities of existing software engineering tools to make them more process aware, and understand interaction pattern between various contributors to improve the efficiency of project.", "authors": ["Monika Gupta"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["08e139c7-baf8-4ed3-a927-31c62d2a5a5c", "16e8dc86-e251-4ea7-aff3-8b1ebea66002", "54ad1a28-f3e9-411f-8eb4-06e1e34925b1", "5a7c4e7b-88b0-4c32-bd27-e28616260e25", "5b5dc7f9-3958-4f03-80cb-4e30a38a522c", "5cf6abc5-8657-4bc9-a873-98e666960e76", "606b6c11-fcc0-497d-8933-a182c42b3a06", "82d901ec-631c-4a1d-b9db-64387deedb72", "87320386-fff7-4413-b1ff-d85e148e62da", "8f766c16-e041-4ffc-b7e1-5d48261f6877", "961748a3-627b-4389-a8f3-a0d01dca2fba", "cf2e092b-c44a-474c-bc0d-3db646dae907", "e66a1272-6c82-4ea8-a876-6b02f9be2e5a", "ef8de76a-262e-4875-b2fd-b2253bc73df4", "f4e8f997-5af8-49a6-a004-6e17a0808c3d", "fb63a144-94aa-479f-b9ca-cf14bef3112c"], "title": "Nirikshan: process mining software repositories to identify inefficiencies, imperfections, and enhance existing process capabilities", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "6d32c45c-491d-4253-a3bd-32a5a759ae88"}

This paper discusses those issues specific for evaluation of software testing techniques and proposes an initiative for a collaborative effort to encourage reproducibility of experiments evaluating software testing techniques (STT). We also propose the development of a tool that enables automatic execution and analysis of experiments producing a reproducible research compendia as output that is, in turn, shared among researchers.

This is done by applying GA in tuning the power allocated for the m th  user in the n th  channel (p m,n ) after solving the resource allocation problem. The first part is a binary optimization problem, whereas the latter part is a continuous optimization problem.

{"abstract": "We describe the design of an undergraduate compilers course that is explicitly intended to teach software engineering concepts and skills in addition to compiler concepts. This objective is accomplished by structuring the course around two parallel learning progressions rather than around the logical structure of a compiler.     The nominal purpose of the project is to develop a simulator and synthesizer for simple circuits written in a subset of VHDL. This subset of VHDL is translated to a simple LL(1) boolean formula language. The circuit simulator reads and writes binary waveforms according to a regular grammar. The students start working with the simple waveform language and work their way up to the subset of VHDL. As the complexity of the input language and transformations increases, new software engineering concepts are introduced to help manage that complexity.     At the end of the project the students can simulate and synthesize simple circuits such as a ripple-carry adder or a multiplexer.", "authors": ["Derek Rayside"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0bf5fb80-7740-40d8-8780-666f7c79d6e3", "2575e242-4204-4a6e-a88e-563143dd4287", "4d46b004-4a26-4a71-93e7-6aa84454fc52", "4e61df18-330e-4c84-b654-42bbc4ae8f57", "580040ab-e127-48ee-bb64-33063d03b8cc", "beed7587-c357-46b0-9246-054900a32896", "d8771a8d-54e1-4454-9ab3-bbfbce286444", "f842dccb-985f-47eb-acbb-2187cc84c404"], "title": "A compiler project with learning progressions", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "6db79766-0103-4bf4-873c-c4ff3cef9bfd"}

The proposed method consists of a proximate time-optimal control, a time varying sliding mode control, and a variable convergence rate factor in discrete-time. Three sufficient conditions are also proposed to ensure the stability of the suggested scheme. The variable convergence rate factor is implemented in the discrete-time sliding mode control in order to eliminate the overshoot problem and reduce the settling time. The proposed controller was applied to a scanning probe microscope-based data storage system so as to compare its performance to that of a proximate time-optimal servomechanism and a sliding mode proximate time-optimal servomechanism.", "authors": ["Won Hee Kim", "Ji Young Jeong", "Chung Choo Chung"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["5381e22b-c393-4af2-88b6-65a120d22e4a"], "title": "A modified discrete-time sliding mode control for proximate time-optimal servomechanisms", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "6de22e62-18e1-4529-a4e7-ac6a5f44ae33"}

{"abstract": "Android software presents many challenges for static program analysis. In this work we focus on the fundamental problem of static control-flow analysis. Traditional analyses cannot be directly applied to Android because the applications are framework-based and event-driven. We consider user-event-driven components and the related sequences of callbacks from the Android framework to the application code, both for lifecycle callbacks and for event handler callbacks.   We propose a program representation that captures such callback sequences. This representation is built using context-sensitive static analysis of callback methods. The analysis performs graph reachability by traversing context-compatible interprocedural control-flow paths and identifying statements that may trigger callbacks, as well as paths that avoid such statements. We also develop a client analysis that builds a static model of the application's GUI.

Some nodes may only need to compute their approximate location at infrequent intervals. Others may need to be continuously and precisely localized. Since GPS is not available indoors, we need to provision a generic ubiquitous localization infrastructure that services specific localization requirements of each mobile sensor node on a best-available-information basis. We assume that each mobile node has an associated user module that gets localized. For implementing graded-precision localization in indoor spaces, we propose a modular architecture for the user module, site-specific deployment strategies, and a framework for evaluating localization performance.

{"abstract": "Since the emergence of peer to peer networks, search efficiency in such networks has been a matter of great concern, as it directly effects resource management of the network and influences users' satisfaction. In unstructured p2p networks, various search algorithms have been proposed so far that offer a tradeoff between scalability, congestion and user's satisfaction. In this paper, we survey newly introduced approaches to overcome search process problems. By reviewing these strategies and comparing them with previous search methods, we propose a new classification of informed search algorithms and we conclude that regarding this classification, informed search algorithms should be applied in less dynamic networks while blind search algorithms are more appropriate in highly dynamic networks. We believe that this taxonomy and the new classification can be useful as a guide for future search algorithm design.", "authors": ["Fatemeh Sharifkhani", "Mohammad Reza Pakravan"], "n_citation": 8, "references": ["08765b96-1b81-45b6-943b-b2395ba57ada", "0e207640-c292-4d2b-9a2d-ecb1c6c23619", "265ee8b0-0891-43b3-9dec-d4e109178011", "36604141-4244-43a9-8aec-aa7ad30a1cbd", "4c36f482-1f7d-4a6c-a6f9-2e0a5b7056a4", "54bf6b67-fd0f-472f-bb15-01bf7c758fd6", "55bb3770-53e3-439a-83b2-e4074012c91f", "5691f4e8-8f10-4cf2-879c-d36c23b36ce4", "5be95a69-d0d7-493b-b422-e9a2a622470d", "7c8b3b4c-1de3-495b-aa43-c7b758865261", "80986ffa-6389-4b69-8e57-7f08ae009b63", "80c6b844-1ef3-48e7-ba0f-698db5f0aa0d", "8634ae4b-69c0-4d18-af6a-ab04ab52f6cc", "9b3a9b21-71cc-4389-a680-28886eb71722", "ad581d37-6e12-4b7e-855e-c6efb03d96a0", "b130170c-23f7-40c3-a9dc-5149c414f63e", "b19f6d3b-7b64-47a7-9bc2-34b5c7889c75", "bbbcdd65-d6d8-4dc7-a43c-db3d5bcba9a4", "ca5c272d-f3c8-44b1-8149-3e9dfb9c1213", "e1263ada-afda-498c-a37d-9b545293118a", "e31ef6a1-1729-46bb-9397-72a8b35d63db", "e516cc47-3372-4bd6-be37-55a86ff08749", "e8545676-16fd-4d5e-a1fa-75fa2a585a27", "eb5738ae-3f62-4616-8590-b801a1b04cfe", "f14df1ed-e3e9-4348-9040-fc06e3411b95", "f3103b83-2b65-42e4-928f-6e7d8c1236ba", "f522ab14-1102-454a-8393-f0998105ed0a"], "title": "A review of new advances in resource discovery approaches in unstructured P2P networks", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "6e09876a-bd95-455b-9a01-6f99ef064e80"}

{"abstract": "This paper 1  describes a program called PROUST which does on- line analysis and understanding of Pascal programs written by novice programmers. PROUST takes as input a program and a non-algorithmic description of the program requirements, and finds the most likely mapping-between the requirements and the code. This mapping is in essence a reconstruction of the design and implementation steps that the programmer went through in writing the program. A knowledge base of programming plans and strategies, together with common bugs associated with them, is used in constructing this mapping. Bugs are discovered in the process of relating plans to the code; PROUST can therefore give deep explanations of program bugs by relating the buggy code to its underlying intentions.", "authors": ["W.

{"abstract": "Decentralized applications are composed of distributed entities that directly interact with each other and make local autonomous decisions in the absence of a centralized coordinating authority. Such decentralized applications, where entities can join and leave the system at any time, are particularly susceptible to the attacks of malicious entities. Each entity therefore requires protective measures to safeguard itself against these entities. Trust management solutions serve to provide effective protective measures against such malicious attacks. Trust relationships help an entity model and evaluate its confidence in other entities towards securing itself. Trust management is, thus, both an essential and intrinsic ingredient of decentralized applications. However, research in trust management has not focused on how trust models can be composed into a decentralized architecture. The PACE architectural style, described previously [21], provides structured and detailed guidance on the assimilation of trust models into a decentralized entity's architecture. In this paper, we describe our experiments with incorporating four different reputation-based trust models into a decentralized application using the PACE architectural style. Our observations lead us to conclude that PACE not only provides an effective and easy way to integrate trust management into decentralized applications, but also facilitates reuse while supporting different types of trust models. Additionally, PACE serves as a suitable platform to aid the evaluation and comparison of trust models in a fixed setting towards providing a way to choose an appropriate model for the setting.", "authors": ["Girish Suryanarayana", "Mamadou H.

We have found this strategy to be sufficiently systematic and practically useful enough to merit exposition for a wider audience.

(2) for each (class of) thing that is of central importance to the problem describe the main stages and transitions in the thing's \u201clife\u201d with respect to the problem,   (3) synthesize the logical data base structure with attributes determined for all record types using results from the previous two steps.

{"abstract": "Autoimmune diseases occur when an inappropriate immune response takes place and produces autoantibodies to fight against human antigens. In order to detect autoimmune disease, a test, called indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) is carried out to identify antinuclear autoantibodies (ANA) in the HEp-2 cell. Current method of analyzing the results is inconsistent as it is limited to subjective factors such as experience and skill of the medical experts. Thus, there is a need for an automated recognition system to reduce the variability and increase the reliability of the test results. This paper proposes a pattern recognition algorithm consisting of statistical methods to extract seven textural features from the HEp-2 cell images followed by classification of staining patterns by using fuzzy logic. This method is applied to the data set of the ICPR 2012 contest. The textural features extracted are based on the first-order statistics and second-order statistics computed from grey level co-occurrence matrices (GLCM). The extracted features are then used as an input parameter to classify five staining patterns by using fuzzy logic.

Such tests can be hard to maintain, especially if they are not properly modularized -- that is, common steps occur in many test cases, which can make test maintenance cumbersome and expensive. Performing modularization manually can take up considerable human effort. To address this, we present an automated approach for modularizing GUI test cases. Our approach consists of multiple phases. In the first phase, it analyzes individual test cases to partition test steps into candidate subroutines, based on how user-interface elements are accessed in the steps. This phase can analyze the test cases only or also leverage execution traces of the tests, which involves a cost-accuracy tradeoff. In the second phase, the technique compares candidate subroutines across test cases, and refines them to compute the final set of subroutines. In the last phase, it creates callable subroutines, with parameterized data and control flow, and refactors the original tests to call the subroutines with context-specific data and control parameters. Our empirical results, collected using open-source applications, illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.", "authors": ["Rahulkrishna Yandrapally", "Giriprasad Sridhara", "Saurabh Sinha"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["02e0342a-33d3-4d3f-9f1d-b14081edbc39", "22436408-5e61-4886-8d84-9fc4b40e9d86", "275ffd0f-4801-46a2-8e98-1225afd97f4b", "2860ecda-ebc2-4e5a-84e4-c27aeeedeef4", "2bc336b9-6b04-4489-ac66-f1c63c694ec0", "357470ca-15ee-4c22-982b-b62f0756c99f", "3958c372-c0f0-4e2d-9386-93e601244b0c", "45579842-c756-4bd6-8b36-33c064bfc4ac", "4a79e805-7f4d-4e2f-b806-8bcb21038d5b", "5d1eeffb-0b19-4b6d-9b64-bf3870d3954a", "66f8529a-a607-48e4-aaf5-002db75a9b20", "6ec2e142-1548-4cde-9d6c-1fc71c0cda95", "70cfc854-5cde-4213-9d45-29e8372b04ac", "7291ae96-1749-4c69-8b6e-0abdf1de301c", "89dc055c-b1b1-4ff7-a902-27419aef582e", "9250f7d9-8e68-47dc-9c0b-115978659672", "938ec820-1a7b-42a4-adf7-e30d3829b843", "9a2cf02f-35d4-453c-bb95-466162e18566", "9b78b805-c36a-4b19-aace-1fa1a7695824", "9bac6c52-4080-4e1e-b9db-959502ab93d4", "ae8a4f9d-ec9c-4768-87ee-f5cb5c3ef754", "b327b607-c45b-41ef-9cd0-535f0d1db54b", "c4a7635c-21f9-4466-b030-298e38016c12", "e1226efd-6889-48fd-89ab-0b8ae8a4e55d", "e12440a9-0ad7-41e3-8309-dabebc30b9d0", "ed8b1e4c-23c7-45a6-aa2b-0585e9c952ab", "f94e92cd-565a-4224-af56-8bc11a08d4f0", "f99e1cdb-48a7-4df2-a1a7-69b1bd290b85", "fb04026c-79dd-4d2f-a067-b2d184b67f79"], "title": "Automated modularization of GUI test cases", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "6eec019d-d56f-4a62-af6b-152cb96c213b"}

{"abstract": "Different methodologists have developed different types of diagrams to represent structural, behavioral and state change aspects of the system. The Unified Modeling Language (UML) was developed by the unification of three amigos design diagrams. The syntactics and semantics used in UML is quite appropriate to Object Oriented Technology (OOT). In fact the Object Management Group (OMG) has recognized the UML as defacto standard design language. UML is claimed to be correct and complete by the original developers. But the constant additions to the bandwagon of diagrams in consecutive versions falsify their claim. This maybe because the concept of language is always limited only to the syntactics & the semantics, whereas the other component pragmatics has the scope to grow to the au-courant needs. In the present form, the UML embodies along with others few diagrams relating to different pragmatics. In this paper, an attempt is made to represent the work process (a prominent pragmatic view) of any information system. To ossify & classify the present diagram into the bandwagon of UML, an attempt is made to incorporate the syntactics & semantics without giving the scope for change in the UML architecture and its specific characteristics. In fact, the introduction of our proposed diagram enhances the virtues of UML by displaying a diagram through the superset of two pragmatic views of the trinity.", "authors": ["Shivanand M.

{"abstract": "Many software systems exceed our human ability to comprehend and manage, and they continue to contain unacceptable errors. This is an unintended consequence of Moore's Law, which has led to increases in system size, complexity, and interconnectedness. Yet, software is still primarily created, modified, and maintained by humans. The interactions among heterogeneous programs, machines and human operators has reached a level of complexity rivaling that of some biological ecosystems. By viewing software as an evolving complex system, researchers could incorporate biologically inspired mechanisms and employ the quantitative analysis methods of evolutionary biology. This approach could improve our understanding and analysis of software; it could lead to robust methods for automatically writing, debugging and improving code; and it could improve predictions about functional and structural transitions as scale increases.

{"abstract": "The edit-distance of two strings is the minimal cost of a sequence of symbol insertions, deletions, or substitutions transforming one string into the other. The definition is used in various contexts to give a measure of the difference or similarity between two strings. This definition can be extended to measure the similarity between two sets of strings. In particular, when these sets are represented by automata, their edit-distance can be computed using the general algorithm of composition of weighted transducers combined with a single-source shortest-paths algorithm. More generally, in some applications such as speech recognition and computational biology, the strings may represent a range of alternative hypotheses with associated probabilities. Thus, we introduce the definition of the edit-distance of two distributions of strings given by two weighted automata. We show that general weighted automata algorithms over the appropriate semirings can be used to compute the edit-distance of two weighted automata exactly. The algorithm for computing exactly the edit-distance of weighted automata can be used to improve the word accuracy of automatic speech recognition systems. More generally, the algorithm can be extended to provide an edit-distance automaton useful for rescoring and other post-processing purposes in the context of large-vocabulary speech recognition. In the course of the presentation of our algorithm, we also introduce a new and general synchronization algorithm for weighted transducers which, combined with \u0190-removal, can be used to normalize weighted transducers with bounded delays.", "authors": ["Mehryar Mohri"], "n_citation": 29, "references": ["0cb06ffe-08d6-4163-b5c7-ca2953b8b3b6", "0eb879a2-af18-450c-81e7-fa5ddfcb5000", "0eecfe9d-77da-4895-824a-0e6aa7884e08", "16e0a963-757b-4450-a056-a46170bdb7d0", "27e5c3a3-36da-4d7b-8cd5-c7964c06e2c5", "280f1494-06da-4e4b-926c-b5d1e9b05557", "332084ee-29ab-411e-9d8b-0dc9e977c5a9", "33834a31-132a-409b-b646-c8918a85afb0", "350509e5-7515-4af8-ad93-df8e5c018d1a", "374226f5-41e9-4de8-a209-0d5d760d30ab", "3b7ad897-ef00-4181-9650-1964e62189ed", "4c2d5f31-06c7-4d9e-85fa-f2cd5a6ae14f", "5221c96a-50e0-45db-9216-276c0eb7a050", "594e1c78-0c50-4ab2-a0d1-08b5c5d7e168", "5d4d2ef7-cedf-450e-99d2-c32636f53e04", "60a2637a-7d81-4429-a9ec-29506302abd1", "63e99111-ddb6-46f3-ba8e-399226b553ea", "63ea9425-d22a-4c65-814c-58e67ae712fc", "78217f0b-007e-4db8-8fb9-0b176eead18c", "8f9c3941-e8ac-46a5-a06a-424cafecb681", "926914a9-b8ba-41b4-9649-d2ff1ebc6880", "bae130f6-1f9a-4dea-a66b-06d090e10631", "c360b7d4-b31c-45f4-8afb-f2e1730acb6f", "fd1b7494-7d07-4d38-a1fe-4ade1aec343c"], "title": "Edit-distance of weighted automata", "venue": "Lecture Notes in Computer Science", "year": 2002, "id": "6f063c09-af18-455c-82f0-def9dfd7c9c4"}

While this approach is of less theoretical interest than the evaluations presented in the referenced articles, it is of substantially more practical significance to a programmer or to an installation which is seeking to answer the following questions: Should a compiler be used? If so, which compiler?

{"abstract": "This paper considers the optimal local leader selection for a leader-first follower minimally persistent formation system. The objective is to maximize the local convergence rate of the followers to the unique equilibrium under small perturbations. Except for the leader and the first follower, every other agent in the system follows exactly two agents called the local leaders and is responsible for maintaining a pair of desired distances from two local leaders. The control algorithm is the linearized form of the decentralized nonlinear control law proposed in our previous work. When the agents are distributed over a rectangular area, the selection of the optimal local leader for each follower is discussed, and it is discovered that the boundary optimality rule applies. The general case when agents distributed over an arbitrary convex domain is further considered based on the matrix perturbation theory. Information of agents in its sensing range is enough for the agent to pick up its optimal local leaders, which allows a distributed implementation of the proposed algorithm.", "authors": ["Huang Huang", "Changbin Yu", "Azwirman Gusrialdi", "Sandra Hirche"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["0f1822c4-c4ff-491f-9a50-e7a0f597dc0b", "13a2bba1-ea17-46b5-8841-8503d7506e73", "74677414-f3a9-4a75-a964-9f5551d75810", "83c77265-778a-4387-8e7d-c25f8107f831", "8fa0ded5-715d-44ff-a117-80a06e17eeef", "ab35dc68-62bd-4c54-81d3-9a8406827489", "b08d7a0b-a4bc-4ba9-a48a-d5ed2dc2fdb9", "bfadd014-9c51-43df-b412-47e4ca0bc84c"], "title": "Topology design for distributed formation control towards optimal convergence rate", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "6f62816c-8de2-40ae-b34b-f83771ad1b02"}

Models of such systems should therefore be compositional in order to reflect the architectural structure. We present herein an extension of the LTSA model checker. It supports the specification, visualisation and failure analysis of composable, probabilistic behaviour of component-based systems, modelled as Probabilistic Component Automata (PCA). To evaluate aspects such as the probability of system failure, a DTMC model can be automatically constructed from the composition of the PCA representations of each component and analysed in tools such as PRISM. Before composition, we reduce each PCA to its interface behaviour in order to mitigate state explosion associated with composite representations. Moreover, existing behavioural analysis techniques in LTSA can be applied to PCA representations to verify the compatibility of interface behaviour between components with matching provided-required interfaces.

{"abstract": "Multiprogramming as it is discussed here is a mode of computer operation in which two or more programs are concurrently in processor memory and proceeding, each using the same central processor unit (CPU) and input-output (I/O) channels. These programs are actually proceeding intermittently and singly, according to eligibility (readiness to proceed) and priority. It is useful to be able to represent them as proceeding continuously and simultaneously, each at an effective rate, which may be a fraction of that which it would enjoy in the absence of the other programs.  The effective progress rate of each program is sensitive to many detailed characteristics of itself and its co-residents; and simulation has been the best available method of predicting it. This paper presents the results of progress in developing an alternative to simulation, a simulation-tested iterative computation of these rates under certain situations. The algorithm is sensitive to most of the factors that control the phenomenon, including nonquantitative or topological features of the programs' structures.", "authors": ["Daniel J.

The inevitable result is that these students have difficulty comprehending large programs after graduation.

{"abstract": "How can we attract developers? What can we do to incentivize developers to write code? We started the study by introducing the population pyramid visualization to software development communities, called  software population pyramids , and found a typical pattern in shapes. This pattern comes from the differences in attracting coding contributors and discussion contributors. To understand the causes of the differences, we then build game-theoretical models of the contribution situation. Based on these results, we again analyzed the projects empirically to support the outcome of the models, and found empirical evidence. The answers to the initial questions are clear.

{"abstract": "The extensive use of software and the ever increasing complexity of software development in today\u2019s world requires a diversity of people from different domains to closely collaborate and create quality software. Unfortunately, a lack of clarity in the different types of roles in software engineering (SE), their diversity and the competencies required by people to perform the roles is a major problem not just for software but for the people involved in the entire process. The main intent of this paper is to discuss different kinds of roles in SE with an aim to understand the challenges of people performing roles from multiple perspectives. To this end, we propose an ontology based framework for modeling roles in SE, which could be adapted for different organizations, projects, domains, environments and even cultures.

{"abstract": "Flash is a widely used storage device in portable mobile devices such as smart phones, digital cameras, and MP3 players. It provides high density and low power, properties that are appealing for other computing domains. In this paper, we examine its use in the server domain. Wear-out has the potential to limit the use of Flash in this domain. To seriously consider Flash in the server domain, architectural support must exist to address this lack of reliability. This paper first provides a survey of current and potential Flash usage models in a data center. We then advocate using Flash as an extended system memory usage model---OS managed disk cache---and describe the necessary architectural changes. Specifically we propose two key changes. The first improves performance and reliability by splitting Flash-based disk caches into separate read and write regions. The second improves reliability by employing a programmable Flash memory controller. It changes the error code strength (number of correctable bits) and the number of bits that a memory cell can store (cell density) in response to the demands of the application.", "authors": ["David Roberts", "Taeho Kgil", "Trevor N.

{"abstract": "Software engineering research and practice are hampered by the lack of a well-understood, top-level dependent variable. Recent initiatives on General Theory of Software Engineering suggest a multifaceted variable \u2013 Software Engineering Success. However, its exact dimensions are unknown. This paper investigates the dimensions (not causes) of software engineering success. An interdisciplinary sample of 191 design professionals (68 in the software industry) were interviewed concerning their perceptions of success. Non-software designers (e.g. architects) were included to increase the breadth of ideas and facilitate comparative analysis. Transcripts were subjected to supervised, semi-automated semantic content analysis, including a software developer vs. other professionals comparison. Findings suggest that participants view their work as time-constrained projects with explicit clients and other stakeholders. Success depends on stakeholder impacts \u2013\u00a0financial, social, physical and emotional \u2013 and is understood through feedback. Concern with meeting explicit requirements is peculiar to software engineering and design is not equated with aesthetics in many other fields. Software engineering success is a complex multifaceted variable, which cannot sufficiently be explained by traditional dimensions including user satisfaction, profitability or meeting requirements, budgets and schedules. A proto-theory of success is proposed, which models success as the net impact on a particular stakeholder at a particular time. Stakeholder impacts are driven by project efficiency, artifact quality and market performance. Success is not additive, e.g., \u2018low\u2019 success for clients does not average with \u2018high\u2019 success for developers to make \u2018moderate\u2019 success overall; rather, a project may be simultaneously successful and unsuccessful from different perspectives.", "authors": ["Paul Ralph", "Paul Kelly"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0ffbba6a-4711-4e10-ad37-358bd8cb6873", "1b16d35d-60ef-491f-8d62-21610cc5df6a", "27706de2-03a6-4e0d-95c3-e5971a91e832", "2a0b18e6-c430-40be-8ba8-668a637ae988", "31fee7d0-f5e1-4b1f-a612-e4e86057171d", "746c5742-df21-4215-8c61-d0d293be88c3", "9b19a579-dc25-4dc8-8139-fd9f264983ac", "9c4a49ba-9d86-4851-b4e4-bbee6f25f1ce", "9c80ef0b-6617-44a5-bcc1-f7ab20e83f0d", "9f3bdcc5-658d-4865-b856-f00b14c3460e", "b420a396-a228-4154-bb3f-8a8b85b50825", "b541380f-8e36-4fd8-91b3-04cf1f8d2736", "d439d5b4-8165-4c29-a151-4e3827d7429b", "dd61fa81-54b3-49ee-abf7-d1a64ab1545d", "e84ea70b-b3a4-46c1-9394-1b27e10c75e7", "fa069cc1-2f92-4bf3-aaa5-453f485d4579", "fe86f906-5809-428b-8fcc-82737fb3d021"], "title": "The dimensions of software engineering success", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "7009968c-5d43-4dd4-bed1-dc8dde71e056"}

Such languages will be a key element in the translation of data among computer systems, as well as in advanced data management systems and distributed data bases.

{"abstract": "Developments in computing offer experts in many fields specialised support for decision making under uncertainty. However, the impact of these technologies remains controversial. In particular, it is not clear how advice of variable quality from a computer may affect human decision makers. Here I review research showing strikingly diverse effects of computer support on expert decision-making. Decisions support can both systematically improve or damaged the performance of decision makers in subtle ways depending on the decision maker's skills, variation in the difficulty of individual decisions and the reliability of advice from the support tool.In clinical trials decision support technologies are often assessed in terms of their average effects. However this methodology overlooks the possibility of differential effects on decisions of varying difficulty, on decision makers of varying competence, of computer advice of varying accuracy and of possible interactions among these variables. Research that has teased apart aggregated clinical trial data to investigate these possibilities has discovered that computer support was less useful for - and sometimes hindered - professional experts who were relatively good at difficult decisions without support; at the same time the same computer support tool helped those experts who were less good at relatively easy decisions without support. Moreover, inappropriate advice from the support tool could bias decision makers' decisions and, predictably, depending on the type of case, improve or harm the decisions.", "authors": ["Peter Ayton"], "n_citation": 0, "title": "Extending the discipline: how software can help or hinder human decision making (and vice-versa)", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2005, "id": "701dfbb0-9eee-4217-9588-4cb45649e2f8"}

{"abstract": "Traditional image resizing techniques are oblivious to the content of the image when changing its width or height. In contrast, media (i.e., image and video) retargeting take s content into account. For example, one would like to change the aspect ratio of a video without making human figures look too fat or too skinny, or change the size of an image by automatically removing \"unnecessary\" portions while keeping the \"important\" features intact. We propose a simple operator; we term  seam carving  to support image and video retargeting. A seam is an optimal 1D path of pixels in an image, or a 2D manifold in a video cube, going from top to bottom, or left to right. Optimality is defined by minimizing an energy function that assigns costs to pixels. We show that computing a seam reduces to a dynamic programming problem for images and a graph min-cut search for video. We demonstrate that several image and video operations, such as aspect ratio correction, size change, and object removal, can be recast as a successive operation of the seam carving operator.", "authors": ["Ariel Shamir", "Shai Avidan"], "n_citation": 110, "references": ["10c8adc2-5710-4672-af81-628f8e30d81c", "11f02673-1cde-4be0-8cb7-066943ac1a5d", "1791d57c-7bc3-448c-9332-5b952de669f0", "19c54125-e8b8-4fac-a841-acd8e8c011de", "21a93e31-884f-47c5-837c-c943021a622c", "41b062ce-620c-4a61-ac9a-4150b24ac2fc", "45844786-21d5-4c3b-b1a6-494fbcc3cbe4", "48e74a3c-9ce8-40d5-a80c-0ec70a3e3b6f", "4a813fb8-759b-4bf1-a735-529716ae84ad", "5a5caadb-543c-4227-9e02-1e3fe4b1f38f", "6a5e9cd0-60f9-4623-ac93-6bc92d505b6a", "6d121e97-e351-4cf9-8c44-d7ab3ce9d9fe", "7144b285-2027-4df6-8841-99b0c0720351", "751717f9-ffb6-42da-8fbe-e7927e61059b", "7b8c3168-921c-436d-bb0b-05bf3fd644df", "a3b3ecce-5921-47ec-a21b-80a8cb1939b8", "b5119ccc-4132-45c5-995c-7c586e63be79", "bc0310e3-c11d-4f2d-9bc4-e8a3b10ca18c", "d979fb54-f1ee-4240-bfea-e37f76819c3c", "dd8087bb-bde1-4b8e-8ef0-3f8d0aabce9b", "e649a9fd-f6d9-4aac-b428-29b82c20a484", "e7978e39-122b-48db-a98c-1cff042f42c9", "ecd283e0-1a8c-49b0-8562-073e5b889af9", "f37cced0-0ce7-4ac1-8e1b-5cbbd00e62c0"], "title": "Seam carving for media retargeting", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2009, "id": "70525ad2-d5b9-4e1c-b11d-ed823c2005f9"}

{"abstract": "At Hewlett-Packard, we have had visible divisional software reuse efforts since the mid-1980s. In 1990, we initiated a multi-faceted corporate reuse program to gather information about reuse from within HP and from other companies. As we studied the existing reuse programs, we discovered that certain issues were poorly understood, and as a consequence, mistakes were made in starting and running certain programs at HP and elsewhere. Our corporate reuse program focused on packaging best-practice information and guidelines to avoid common pitfalls. We also developed technology transfer and educational processes to spread this information and enhance reuse practice within the company. In 1992, we launched a multi-disciplinary research program to investigate and develop better methods for domain-specific, reuse-based software engineering. We have learned that for large-scale reuse to work, the problems to be overcome are mostly non-technical. >", "authors": ["Martin L.

Vehicle sideslip and roll parameters are estimated in presence of the road bank angle and the road curvature as unknown inputs. The unknown inputs are then estimated using the observer results. The used nonlinear model deduced from the vehicle lateral and roll dynamics with a vision system is represented by a Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy model in order to take into account the nonlinearities of the cornering forces. Taking into account the unmeasured variables, an unknown inputs TS observer is then designed on the basis of the measure of the roll rate, the steering angle and the lateral offset given by the distance between the road centerline and the vehicle axe at a look-ahead distance.

{"abstract": "The paper considers the distributed formation control problem given bearing-only sensing of nearby agents with respect to a global vector frame, provided by a compass. We propose a bearing-compass control law and prove its convergence to a formation that is unique up to translation and scaling. We present results that describe the formation's evolution in terms useful to a human operator, focusing on scale, translation and rotation of the formation. The results are supported with a number of illustrative examples. Index Terms\u2014Distributed Control; Human-Swarm Interaction; Bearing-Only Control Our contribution lies in the analysis of the bearing-only control problem from the perspective of a human operator. Being able to rotate, scale, and translate a formation using high-level commands is appealing since they are intuitive for a human operator to execute. In this paper, we show scale and centroid invariance and formation convergence with unforced dynamics for the proposed control laws. We also examine how the agents translate and scale in the presence of arbitrary additive control signals, focusing on the effects from one or two agents. Finally, we examine the behavior of the system when a single command to rotate or translate is broadcast to all agents. The structure of the paper is as follows.

{"abstract": "Software testing is the primary activity to guarantee some level of quality of software systems. In software testing, the role of test oracles is crucial: The quality of test oracles directly affects the effectiveness of the testing activity and influences the final quality of software systems. So far, research in software testing focused mostly on automating the generation of test inputs and the execution of test suites, paying less attention to the generation of test oracles. Available techniques for generating test oracle are either effective but expensive or inexpensive but ineffective. Our research work focuses on the generation of cost-effective test oracles. Recent research work has shown that modern software systems can provide the same functionality through different execution sequences. In other words, multiple execution sequences perform the same, or almost the same, action. This phenomenon is called intrinsic redundancy of software systems. We aim to design and develop a completely automated technique to generate test oracles by exploiting the intrinsic redundancy freely available in the software. Test oracles generated by our technique check the equivalence between a given execution sequence and all the redundant and supposedly equivalent execution sequences that are available. The results obtained so far are promising.", "authors": ["Alberto Goffi"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0fd5aa4c-c75c-4ea0-8d7d-b3e161691e4d", "1240609a-0ab9-469f-a242-c31d635c6cb3", "260e352b-b69c-4aa6-9418-7aa565278951", "276acf4f-1b3e-4733-b4fa-5f56b4a0a214", "2872c6e4-a55c-4248-aec6-ffb53f2e0884", "289715ea-8659-42d2-9c8d-b97e683beb2b", "31916a3f-5247-44ae-b32c-fdc7cab42f16", "55d455b6-acc2-460c-8033-4a43cac0da5c", "57e46d47-fa8e-4721-b6a4-2109c8db8bb8", "5b7cc4b8-af42-40cd-a22d-4c5c8b1ab13e", "70b37df6-1eb9-4781-b2d8-8abc6468e6fb", "7d858c10-2f60-4a71-b51c-be58827083d8", "7eefbefb-2b7a-452e-ac38-6092532585d1", "a09b9bc5-a653-46c7-9f2b-d4509b4449f3", "c33cbd29-883b-43d8-a536-bfb76b191d7a", "d9582cb6-104b-4c2d-972b-376de596c52e", "f8af2e50-1a51-4fc6-b0e9-f12a22ac2184"], "title": "Automatic generation of cost-effective test oracles", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "70e8bcf3-9695-41c8-882a-26ca64f65eee"}
{"abstract": "Sustainability has emerged as a broad concern for society. Many engineering disciplines have been grappling with challenges in how we sustain technical, social and ecological systems. In the software engineering community, for example, maintainability has been a concern for a long time. But too often, these issues are treated in isolation from one another. Misperceptions among practitioners and research communities persist, rooted in a lack of coherent understanding of sustainability, and how it relates to software systems research and practice. This article presents a cross-disciplinary initiative to create a common ground and a point of reference for the global community of research and practice in software and sustainability, to be used for effectively communicating key issues, goals, values and principles of sustainability design for software-intensive systems. The centrepiece of this effort is the  Karlskrona Manifesto for Sustainability Design , a vehicle for a much needed conversation about sustainability within and beyond the software community, and an articulation of the fundamental principles underpinning design choices that affect sustainability. We describe the motivation for developing this manifesto, including some considerations of the genre of the manifesto as well as the dynamics of its creation. We illustrate the collaborative reflective writing process and present the current edition of the manifesto itself. We assess immediate implications and applications of the articulated principles, compare these to current practice, and suggest future steps.", "authors": ["Christoph Becker", "Ruzanna Chitchyan", "Leticia Duboc", "Steve M.

The evolution of the game is based on a stochastic fictitious play process. Players do not have access to each other's payoff matrix. Each has to observe the other's actions up to present and plays the action generated based on the best response to these observations. However, when the game is played over a communication network, there are several practical issues that need to be taken into account: First, the players may make random decision errors from time to time. Second, the players' observations of each other's previous actions may be incorrect. The players will try to compensate for these errors based on the information they have. We examine convergence property of the game in such scenarios, and establish convergence to the equilibrium point under some mild assumptions when both players are restricted to two actions.", "authors": ["Kien C.

{"abstract": "Parnas' seminal work [2] on separation of concerns in design has led to diverse innovations in programming language design, to support modularity. However, there has been a growing sentiment in many quarters that there are some concerns that stubbornly resist tidy confinement, when using established modularization mechanisms in pro- gramming languages. A diverse set of new approaches have emerged in response: aspects [1], monads [5], mixin lay- ers [3], and multi-dimensional separation of concerns [4]. These approaches arose more or less independently of each other, and have (to varying degrees) developed technical maturity, real-world credibility and strong user bases. We are also now beginning to see strong scholarly comparisions of the intellectual foundations and practical utility of these different aproaches. This panel aims to support this trend. In this panel, we bring together leading experts (Profs. Batory, Kiczales, and Launchbury, and Dr. Tarr) in these different areas. Each represents a particular perspective on how to evolve and adapt the old idea of modularization to deal with new challenges such as security, fault-tolerance, distribution, and auditing. In addition, we also have two pioneering researchers (Profs. Balzer and Parnas) to pro- vide us with a historical perspective on the evolution (sic) of program modularization and evolution techniques.

{"abstract": "Control of semiactive devices, such as magnetorheo-logical fluid dampers for mitigating earthquake- and wind-induced motion of structures, is often accomplished using a clipped-optimal approach. This control strategy uses a primary optimal controller designed assuming the devices were active, linear and ideal, and a secondary bang-bang controller to make the semiactive device produce forces that mimic, as closely as possible, the desired active control. With multiple control devices, one or more may be inactive at any one time when the corresponding desired force is non-dissipative and cannot be exerted by a semiactive device. This approach effectively uses a gain scheduling type of approach, but it has not previously been studied in that context. This paper investigates a variety of schedule combinations of control gains to determine which approaches strongly affect the performance of the closed-loop response and find optimal gain schedule designs. The example demonstrates that improvements of at least 15%, relative to a standard clipped-optimal control, are achievable with a simple gain schedule design.", "authors": ["Tat S. Fu", "Erik A.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we consider the filtering of distributed parameter systems (DPS), i.e., systems governed by partial differential equations (PDE). We adopt a reduced order model (ROM) based strategy to solve the problem. We propose a randomly perturbed iterative version of the snapshot proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) technique, termed RI-POD, to construct ROMs for DPS that is capable of capturing their global behaviour.

The thermal neutron beam-line at the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST) Center for Neutron Research was used to measure the Lithium concentration in an operating Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) pouch cell battery with typical commercial electrodes. A stroboscopic imaging technique was developed to generate images with longer effective exposure time, increasing the signal to noise ratio and enabling measurement of changes in lithium concentration during high power transients. The measurement of the solid phase lithium concentration distribution across the electrode for high rate (7.5C / 3C) short duration (20\u201340s) pulses are compared with the simulated distributions from a commercial battery simulation software package using the same experimental conditions.", "authors": ["Jason B.

{"abstract": "The aim of the First International Workshop on Global Integrated Model Management is to bring together researchers working on outstanding model driven engineering issues, with a view to discussing them, comparing their approaches, techniques or ideas, and letting these researchers take advantage of different perspectives on these issues. More particularly we are now see the second-generation modeling environments coming up, where the focus is no more on one unique general purpose modeling language (like UML 2.1 for example), but on a large family of more or less related domain specific languages (DSLs) corresponding to different corporations, different needs, different levels of abstraction, etc. First generation tools were mainly based on one unique metamodel (e.g. UML) while most recent tools are metamodel agnostic and able to deal with various kinds of metamodels or DSLs. The advantages of using a set of DSLs instead of one unique General Purpose Language (GPL) are easy to understand, but we also need to cope with the corresponding drawbacks. The resulting fragmentation may be addressed by the existence of a unique metametamodel (like OMG's MOF) to which all DSLs may conform. They are however various proposal for this \"unique\" metametamodel (e.g. EMF ECORE, Microsoft DSL/Tools, etc.). Another solution is to use precisely defined and semantically sound model transformation and composition operators between the various DSLs. However these solutions alone are not sufficient to handle the complex situation arising from the use of a high number of artifacts of different types like models, metamodels, model transformations, model weaving, etc. This is true when various technical spaces [1] as well as different domains are taken into account. The notion of metamodel takes different incarnations in each technical space (e.g. grammars in Grammarware, ontologies in Ontologyware, schemas in XMLware, etc.). The fragmentation problem remain however the same. Therefore we need to devise general and solid solutions to global integrated model management in situations where the various artifacts are distributed as general resources available in a web based distributed system. As a consequence global model management is bringing a set of new research challenges that we have to address on the short to medium term. To solve these open problems, it will be interesting to apply the same kind of methods that have originated them, i.e. model engineering solutions and consequently we need to invent these new \"integrated\" methods to global model management. These new engineering techniques need to be based on a solid modeling theory, dealing wth composition, refinement, abstraction and other useful semantic based development relationships between models.", "authors": ["Jean B\u00e9zivin", "Jean-Marie Favre", "Bernhard Rumpe"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["1b42ac20-4eb4-4833-8a00-e14abbb647b1", "2e3713dc-4017-4ebe-b49d-6f4ac3c1a042", "77e69255-b864-4c79-83b8-04cd453298fd"], "title": "First international workshop on global integrated model management", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2006, "id": "7173b195-5118-4dfd-97e4-e28ce55f006f"}

This paper focuses on a hybrid approach for intrusion detection system (IDS) based on data mining techniques. The main research method is clustering analysis with the aim to improve the detection rate and decrease the false alarm rate. Most of the previously proposed methods suffer from the drawback of k-means method with low detection rate and high false alarm rate. This paper presents a hybrid data mining approach encompassing feature selection, filtering, clustering, divide and merge and clustering ensemble.

Processes from the higher level queues always gets priority over the processes in lower level queues which can cause starvation for processes in lower queues. In this paper we propose a new fuzzy based multilevel queue CPU scheduling algorithm. In our proposed work ready queue is divided into two sub-queues which contain I/O bound and CPU bound processes. CPU time is allocated dynamically to each queue. We have designed two fuzzy inference systems. One is to dynamically allocate the CPU time to two queues. Another FIS is designed to calculate the time quantum to schedule the I/O bound processes. Our proposed work improves the starvation problem and the average response time.", "authors": ["Vaishali Chahar", "Supriya Raheja"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["25a23e8f-967a-44c4-873c-6051f3b4e00f"], "title": "Fuzzy based multilevel queue scheduling algorithm", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "71c49dd8-630d-4e64-837b-1c5f208c40d0"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, we generalize the Hoede-Bakker index, which is a measure for the power of agents in a network, taking into account the mutual influences of the agents. We adopt sets of axioms different from the one adopted in the original definition. In particular, we remove an original assumption according to which changing all inclinations of the players leads to the opposite group decision. Several examples showing the usefulness of this generalization are constructed. In particular, we may apply the generalized Hoede-Bakker index to a game with a vetoer. Next, the relation between the generalized Hoede-Bakker index and the Penrose measure is analysed. Moreover, we introduce several modifications of the Hoede-Bakker index which lead to the Coleman indices, the Rae index, and the Konig-Brauninger index. In order to show the relation between the generalized or the modified Hoede-Bakker index and the other power indices, we use the probabilistic approach.", "authors": ["Agnieszka Rusinowska", "Harrie C.

{"abstract": "As modeling in software and system development becomes increasingly prevalent, many engineers need to collaboratively develop models spanning many disciplines such as requirements management, system design, software, etc. However, integrating modeling languages for various disciplines is challenging, because UML and SysML are too complex for many engineers to understand. Therefore, in complicated engineering processes, engineers with different areas of expertise often find it difficult to access the same information in different domain-specific modeling environments.     Our approach to address this problem is to share and edit the models as task-oriented spreadsheets, using a unified model (in UML or SysML) and a unified user interface (in the spreadsheet program). The formats of the spreadsheets are optimized for various tasks while the target models remain in a unified modeling language. Since the transformation between the spreadsheets and the models is automated and transparent, users do not have to be skilled with the modeling languages to edit the spreadsheets.     Using our novel approach, we were able to reduce the errors and time, and also the difficulty for each task without providing specialized training for the engineers. A preliminary user study showed that, by applying the spreadsheet-based approach, we could reduce the number of errors with less time for typical systems engineering tasks.", "authors": ["Hisashi Miyashita", "Hideki Tai", "Shunichi Amano"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["00f81c8f-dee1-47ea-bd8c-ff5298973460", "02426ca1-b6f8-4880-912c-a0b841bbf4c9", "04d92d9a-d88c-4e70-b239-78456cdfe4fd", "0b0fbb88-f86e-4ca6-b67d-00b2e44d6c66", "0bdcff71-d339-4559-b43c-79c86e6810f7", "148dd651-7944-43e9-91aa-ab66e56ff7ec", "3091ea67-f46d-462e-bd12-12ef378c4083", "3664c4ac-d49d-4062-ae9b-7032f5943754", "414307a7-3e20-4f32-a2ea-c62cf53e4649", "52cbf500-4c3b-42e8-a78d-3dca040055dc", "a852396f-4801-430d-9f22-e307baea9627", "c6bf4831-1b8e-4252-9c0d-881049fb3b08", "c8ea9636-c4af-4cb0-9218-4b27effe3a6e"], "title": "Controlled modeling environment using flexibly-formatted spreadsheets", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "71ec9d93-ccb9-4f7d-a4ba-e22fd5c342f2"}

{"abstract": "A system that is highly dependable under hostile conditions but whose dependability cannot be easily evaluated prior to the deployment of applications is less desirable than a system with lower but predictable dependability. This is because a decision-making on the deployment of high assurance systems is often based on a risk analysis of application failures. For system services implemented on a cloud, system certification assumes added importance because of third-party control of cloud resources and the attendant problems of faults, QoS degradations, and security violations. Our paper focuses on a knowledge-theoretic approach to reason about the dependability of a cloud-based network system using observational agents. Our approach is corroborated by measurements on system-level prototypes and simulation analysis of system models in the face of hostile environment conditions.

{"abstract": "In this paper we propose a novel methodology for optimal allocation of a portfolio of risky financial assets. Most existing methods that aim at compromising between portfolio performance (e.g. expected return) and its risk (e.g. volatility or shortfall probability) need some statistical model of the asset returns. This means that: (i) one needs to make rather strong assumptions on the market for eliciting a return distribution, and (ii) the parameters of this distribution need be somehow estimated, which is quite a critical aspect, since optimal portfolios will then depend on the way parameters are estimated. Here we propose instead a direct, data-driven, route to portfolio optimization that avoids both of the mentioned issues: the optimal portfolios are computed directly from historical data, by solving a sequence of convex optimization problems (typically, simple linear programs). Much more importantly, the resulting portfolios are theoretically backed by a guarantee that their expected shortfall is no larger than an a-priori assigned level. This result is here obtained assuming efficiency of the market, under no hypotheses on the shape of the joint distribution of the asset returns (which can remain unknown and need not be estimated) or on their correlation structure.", "authors": ["Giuseppe Carlo Calafiore", "Bruno Monastero"], "n_citation": 15, "references": ["0973822d-16aa-4762-831d-59d35303f439", "192b76c9-3ecf-43fc-9920-b2db9f734439", "705e693c-1cc2-4e0e-9611-f31c9079b32f", "7729e50d-576b-45c8-8fba-71e31bd5175d", "b2af6bdd-3f03-4a85-b350-d91a38565123", "b7cd452e-93bd-46bb-b5ee-aa11c53c87c0", "ccab72bc-236c-44ce-aec7-7c14c8fe3271", "efadf6c3-bd72-47ec-a5d1-0fe1c8c99635"], "title": "Data-driven asset allocation with guaranteed short-fall probability", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "72378731-09a0-4ea8-979e-9140746f5e39"}
{"abstract": "Issue trackers monitor the progress of software development \"issues\", such as bug fixes and discussions about features. Typically, developers subscribe to issues they are interested in through the tracker, and are informed of changes and new developments via automated email. In practice, however, this approach does not scale well, as developers may receive large volumes of messages that they must sort through using their mail client; over time, it becomes increasingly challenging for them to maintain awareness of the issues that are relevant to their activities and tasks. To address this problem, we present a tool called DASH that is implemented in the form of personalized views of issues; developers indicate issues of interest and DASH presents customized views of their progress and informs them of changes as they occur.

{"abstract": "This article proposes a research agenda aimed at enabling optimized testing and analysis processes and tools to support component-based software development communities. We hypothesize that  de facto communities ---sets of projects that provide, maintain and integrate many shared infrastructure components---are commonplace. Currently, community members, often unknown to each other, tend to work in isolation, duplicating work, failing to learn from each other's effort, and missing opportunities to efficiently improve the common infrastructure. We further hypothesize that as software integration continues to become the predominant mode of software development, there will be increasing value in tools and techniques that empower these communities to coordinate and optimize their development efforts, and to generate and broadly share information. Such tools and techniques will greatly improve the robustness, quality and usability of the common infrastructure which, in turn, will greatly reduce the time and effort needed to produce and use the end systems that are the true goal of the entire community.", "authors": ["Atif M.

{"abstract": "In [4] Maruyama and Smith analyzed design alternatives for virtual memory indexes. The indexes investigated were those modeled on the structure of VSAM [5] which are closely related to B-trees [1]. Maruyama and Smith presented alternatives for search strategies, page format, and whether or not to compress keys. They made a comparative analysis based on the average cost of processing the index for retrieval of a key with its associated data pointer (or a sequence of keys and data pointers). The analysis showed that the optimal solution depends on machine and file characteristics and they provided formulas for selecting the best alternative. In this brief note 1  we propose that another alternative for the page format be considered. The basic idea is to replace the sequential representation within a page by a linked representation. The main advantage of this method is realized in the construction (and maintenance) phase of the index. Although this phase is difficult to analyze quantitatively\u2014as alluded to in [4]\u2014we provide data to substantiate our claim of a net saving in construction cost without any corresponding loss in the average retrieval cost.

{"abstract": "Software engineering researchers are increasingly relying on the empirical approach to advance the state of the art. The level of empirical rigor and evidence required to guide software engineering research, however, can vary drastically depending on many factors. In this session we identify some of these factors through a discussion of the state of the art in performing empirical studies in software engineering, and we show how we can utilize the notion of empirical maturity to set and adjust the empirical expectations for software engineering research efforts.Regarding the state of the art in performing empirical studies, we will offer perspectives on two classes of study: those concerned with humans utilizing a technology, e.g., a person applying a methodology, a technique, or a tool, where human skills and the ability to interact with the technology are some of the primes issues, and those concerned with the application of the technology to an artifact, e.g., a technique or tool applied to a design or a program. In the first case, the emphasis is typically on issues like feasibility, usefulness, and then on effectiveness. The technology tends to be less well specified and based more on the experience and skills of the technology applier. In the second case, the emphasis is typically on the efficiency and effectiveness of the technology. The technology tends to be well defined and the assumption is that the individual skill and experience plays a less important role. We will discuss the set of factors that influence the design, implementation, and validity of these studies.Regarding empirical maturity and its implications on the SE community's expectations, we will provide examples of the large spectrum of studies with different maturity levels that can be performed to successfully support software engineering research. We will then identify and analyze the following aspects that are likely to impact a study's maturity level: technology (well-specified vs. under development), goals of the study (effectiveness vs. feasibility), type of design and analysis (controlled experiment vs. case study, quantitative vs. qualitative), control and specification of threats to validity (internal vs. external threats), dependence on context (in vivo vs. in vitro), relationship to previous empirical work (replicated on-site, replicated off-site, non-replicated, non-replicable), and purposes of the study (exploratory vs. confirmatory). We will lead a discussion on these key aspects that must be considered to assess the empirical maturity of a piece of work in the context of its research area and the empirical maturity of that area.", "authors": ["Victor R.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we develop a modeling and optimization procedure for minimizing the operating costs of a combined cooling, heating, and power (CCHP) plant at the University of California, Irvine, which uses co-generation and Thermal Energy Storage (TES) capabilities. Co-generation allows the production of thermal energy along with electricity, by recovering heat from the generators in a power plant. TES provides the ability to \u2018reshape\u2019 the cooling demands during the course of a day, in refrigeration and air-conditioning plants. Therefore, both cogeneration and TES provide a potential to improve the efficiency and economy of energy conversion. The proposed modeling and optimization approach aims to design a supervisory control strategy to effectively utilize this potential, and involves analysis over multiple physical domains which the CCHP system spans, such as thermal, mechanical, chemical and electrical. Advantages of the proposed methodology are demonstrated using simulation case studies.", "authors": ["Vikas Chandan", "Anh-Tuan Do", "Baoduo Jin", "Faryar Jabbari", "Jack Brouwer", "Ioannis Akrotirianakis", "Amit Chakraborty", "Andrew G.

{"abstract": "A framework for information-guided simulated annealing is presented in this paper. Information gathered during randomized exploration of the optimization domain is used as feedback with progressively increasing gain to drive the optimization procedure. Modeling of \u201cinformation\u201d can be performed in a variety of ways, with the ultimate objective of keeping track of the performance of the stochastic search procedure. A guided-annealing temperature is defined that incorporates information into the cooling schedule. The resulting algorithm has two phases: phase I performs (nearly) unrestricted exploration as a reconnaissance to survey the optimization domain, while phase II \u201cre-heats\u201d the optimization procedure and exploits information gathered during phase I. Phase I flows seamlessly into phase II via an information effectiveness parameter without need for user input. The algorithm presented in this paper improves the performance and success rate of the existing simulated annealing algorithms significantly.

{"abstract": "Recent work on workspace monitoring allows conflict pre- diction early in the development process, however, these approaches mostly use syntactic differencing techniques to compare different program versions. In contrast, traditional change-impact analysis techniques analyze related versions of the program only after the code has been checked into the master repository. We propose a novel approach, DeCAF (Development Context Analysis Framework), that leverages the development context to scope a change impact analysis technique. The goal is to characterize the impact of each developer on other developers in the team. There are various client applications such as task prioritization, early conflict detection, and providing advice on testing that can benefit from such a characterization. The DeCAF frame- work leverages information from the development context to bound the iDiSE change impact analysis technique to analyze only the parts of the code base that are of interest. Bounding the analysis can enable DeCAF to efficiently com- pute the impact of changes using a combination of program dependence and symbolic execution based approaches.", "authors": ["Anita Sarma", "Joshua Branchaud", "Matthew B.

{"abstract": "Software architectures promote development focused on modular building blocks and their interconnections. Since architecture-level components often contain complex functionality, it is reasonable to expect that their interactions will also be complex. Modeling and implementing software connectors thus becomes a key aspect of architecture-based development. Software interconnection and middleware technologies such as RMI, CORBA, ILU, and ActiveX provide a valuable service in building applications from components. The relation of such services to software connectors in the context of software architectures, however, is not well understood. To understand the tradeoffs among these technologies with respect to architectures, we have evaluated several off-the-shelf middleware technologies and identified key techniques for utilizing them in implementing software connectors. Our platform for investigation was C2, a component- and message-based architectural style. By encapsulating middleware functionality within software connectors, we have coupled C2's existing benefits such as component interchangeability, substrate independence and structural guidance with new capabilities of multi-lingual, multi-process and distributed application development in a manner that is transparent to architects.", "authors": ["Eric M.

{"abstract": "Adopting agile software development methods is a wide and complex organisational change that usually impacts several aspects of the organisation (e.g., its structure, culture, management practices, produced artefacts, technologies in use, etc). In order to successfully handle the several key challenges, it's crucial to understand the organisation context and carefully study the transformation strategies.     This paper presents an agile transformation experience that has been undertaken in a public organisation in Belgium and during which Scrum was applied in two pilot projects. The first project retrospective shows that the change cannot be accomplished only at the team-level without taking into account the overall structure of the organisation and that we must carefully evolve toward a context-specific adapted method. In the second pilot project, we defined structured and repeatable steps to assist the adoption of agile practices. The experience shows the usefulness of such an approach but suggests that automation efforts should be addressed.

It then uses a novel ranking algorithm to give suspiciousness scores to the original statements in the Makefile.

{"abstract": "Introduction    Traditionally, radiology is a support department that provides imaging services to other hospital departments. In this conventional framework, the primary concerns of a radiology department were how to enhance the productivity of imaging workflows. Most efforts have been made principally to remove unnecessary communications and thereby reduce report turnaround time. The introduction of information systems such as PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) and RIS (Radiology Information System) are typical examples of such efforts.   Over the past decades, imaging technologies have advanced remarkably, and have led to the proliferation of digital imaging services. Many imaging solution providers are offering various off-the-shelf software programs at more affordable prices. Those programs are equipped with sophisticated imaging functions, and can easily manipulate the large amounts of image data generated from high-performance imaging modalities. As a result, the number of imaging centers providing diagnostic imaging services has grown considerably, and competition between them has intensified.   In this evolving environment, enhanced productivity of imaging workflow is not sufficient to guarantee a competitive and successful imaging business. Rather, more diversified perspectives of customer satisfaction must be considered, and technological advancements must be leveraged for the quality and the competitiveness as well as the productivity of imaging services.   In this article, we envision digital imaging services in radiology, with emphasis on the recent advancements in digital imaging technology and its future direction. Specifically, we focus on the four major issues prevailing in current imaging business practices: specialization, flexibility, reliability, and usability.

{"abstract": "Bad requirements quality can have expensive consequences during the software development lifecycle. Especially, if iterations are long and feedback comes late - the faster a problem is found, the cheaper it is to fix.     We propose to detect issues in requirements based on requirements (bad) smells by applying a light-weight static requirements analysis. This light-weight technique allows for instant checks as soon as a requirement is written down. In this paper, we derive a set of smells, including automatic smell detection, from the natural language criteria of the ISO/IEC/IEEE 29148 standard.     We evaluated the approach with 336 requirements and 53 use cases from 9 specifications that were written by the car manufacturer Daimler AG and the chemical business company Wacker Chemie AG, and discussed the results with their requirements and domain experts.     While not all problems can be detected, the case study shows that lightweight smell analysis can uncover many practically relevant requirements defects. Based on these results and the discussion with our industry partners, we conclude that requirements smells can serve as an efficient supplement to traditional reviews or team discussions, in order to create fast feedback on requirements quality.", "authors": ["Henning Femmer", "Daniel M\u00e9ndez Fern\u00e1ndez", "Elmar Juergens", "Michael Klose", "Ilona Zimmer", "J\u00f6rg Zimmer"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0b373c67-35a2-4666-9592-f33eed2f34ff", "0ce55ec5-b675-4bd9-a242-245fff4f8196", "14f791d7-393c-438d-9baf-b854b3977144", "183eb84b-3be6-4faa-8f74-91b85ecfbfd7", "1bac785e-5e0f-490f-8b7f-adc2649ba0f2", "3b48b952-b531-466d-8e2a-987147762816", "3f221468-b78a-4b30-8406-3638f41467a5", "3fd6eb96-c103-4d42-971f-9267a70cc14d", "65acba26-3449-48c8-ac84-83465430d11b", "6a69a1c8-9c0f-494c-8457-c8e3bdea3d68", "6b75d721-7cf3-468e-ad4d-dbd4d9fc77cd", "83b86208-caf4-4c34-88f0-35b575ad8c09", "b0720f52-e1ca-4cfe-982b-a93e753e8dcc", "b1a7133d-2c9d-43f1-9431-c3fb805c8649", "bbc60760-ed56-41c4-961d-6eb6c4dce702", "c28cf51b-79cf-4b24-9234-8b304f11e6ca", "c92558de-601e-4b5e-8a7f-6eb20ceaef7c", "de804803-5f16-4153-b05b-c2207d02ab09", "df46e027-1961-4c39-a568-880cc84f8390", "fc1f0e93-3735-4715-a26a-943ffefa759d"], "title": "Rapid requirements checks with requirements smells: two case studies", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "739347c3-b33d-492b-9d52-98e456e97441"}

Pairing heaps are extremely simple to implement and seem to be very efficient in practice, but they are difficult to analyze theoretically, and open problems remain. It has been conjectured that they achieve the same amortized time bounds as Fibonacci heaps, namely, O (log  n )  time for  delete  and  delete_min  and O(1) for all other operations, where n is the size of the priority queue at the time of the operation. We provide empirical evidence that supports this conjecture. The most promising algorithm in our simulations is a new variant of the twopass method, called auxiliary twopass.

{"abstract": "Self Powered Neutron Detectors (SPNDs), which are widely used in a nuclear reactor for flux measurement, typically have different types of dynamics based on their emitter material: one delayed, second prompt and possibly nonlinear response characteristics. The measurement from the SPNDs hence need compensation to obtain the actual input flux. In this paper, we discuss the modeling of and input estimation design for Vanadium and Cobalt SPNDs. We obtain the structure and parameters of the Vanadium SPND model from its radioactive decay mechanism. We then obtain the other parameters of the model applying system identification tools on the available data corresponding to reactor trip. For Cobalt SPND, we design two model based input/state estimators; the nonlinearity being the key feature: the \u2018Exact Model Inversion\u2019 and the Extended Kalman filter. In the exact model inversion, we demonstrate that input flux can be calculated by solving a third degree polynomial. In the extended Kalman filter estimator, we propose a novel approach to improve the step response of Kalman filter algorithms by \u2018resetting\u2019 the state error covariance matrix. We use Matlab \u00ae  simulation and reactor data to compare the advantages of the two filters. We show that in both Vanadium and Cobalt SPND cases, Kalman filter based algorithms provide a reasonable balance between speed and noise suppression. While the exact inversion provides an almost prompt, but noisy response to step changes, the modified Kalman filter has a noise-free response with a few minutes of settling time. We also demonstrate the ability of the proposed covariance reset Kalman filter to track step/sudden changes in the input.", "authors": ["Krishnan Srinivasarengan", "Laxman Mutyam", "Madhu N.

{"abstract": "Randomized optimization is a recently established tool for control design with modulated robustness. While for uncertain convex programs there exist randomized approaches with efficient sampling, this is not the case for non-convex problems. Approaches based on statistical learning theory are applicable for a certain class of non-convex problems, but they usually are conservative in terms of performance and are computationally demanding. In this paper, we present a novel scenario approach for a wide class of random non-convex programs. We provide a sample complexity similar to the one for uncertain convex programs, but valid for all feasible solutions inside a set of a-priori chosen complexity. Our scenario approach applies to many non-convex control-design problems, for instance control synthesis based on uncertain bilinear matrix inequalities. I.

{"abstract": "A practical problem for control engineers is the selection of the most adequate model of a physical plant in order to design a controller which should achieve a desired performance level. For this selection the required performance, the resulting model uncertainty and a well-established robust controller design methodology play important roles. They determine the structure and complexity of the desired model, i.e. higher performance and low uncertainty levels require higher model complexity in general. Hence an identification procedure focused on the desired performance, rather than on a good mimic of the system dynamics, could prove useful. Here we present an open discussion on this problem illustrated by two examples, both described by nonlinear equations: a Diabetes Mellitus glucose-insulin dynamics and a 2DOF magnetic bearing system.

{"abstract": "Load testing is one of the means for evaluating the performance of Large Scale Systems (LSS). At the end of a load test, performance analysts must analyze thousands of performance counters from hundreds of machines under test. These performance counters are measures of run-time system properties such as CPU utilization, Disk I/O, memory consumption, and network traffic. Analysts observe counters to find out if the system is meeting its Service Level Agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we present and evaluate one supervised and three unsupervised approaches to help performance analysts to 1) more effectively compare load tests in order to detect performance deviations which may lead to SLA violations, and 2) to provide them with a smaller and manageable set of important performance counters to assist in root-cause analysis of the detected deviations. Our case study is based on load test data obtained from both a large scale industrial system and an open source benchmark application. The case study shows, that our wrapper-based supervised approach, which uses a search-based technique to find the best subset of performance counters and a logistic regression model for deviation prediction, can provide up to 89% reduction in the set of performance counters while detecting performance deviations with few false positives (i.e., 95% average precision). The study also shows that the supervised approach is more stable and effective than the unsupervised approaches but it has more overhead due to its semi-automated training phase.", "authors": ["Haroon Malik", "Hadi Hemmati", "Ahmed E.

However, advanced tooling is hampered by the dynamic nature of the language, which makes any form of static analysis very difficult. We single out efficient call graph construction as a key problem to be solved in order to improve development tools for JavaScript. To address this problem, we present a scalable field-based flow analysis for constructing call graphs. Our evaluation on large real-world programs shows that the analysis, while in principle unsound, produces highly accurate call graphs in practice. Previous analyses do not scale to these programs, but our analysis handles them in a matter of seconds, thus proving its suitability for use in an interactive setting.", "authors": ["Asger Feldthaus", "Max Sch\u00e4fer", "Manu Sridharan", "Julian Dolby", "Frank Tip"], "n_citation": 66, "references": ["14590462-b6c0-4c4f-8914-d61eea3a1998", "32e079c7-fca8-4333-8790-b7748b40dcf0", "42bd6eea-6822-43e0-b916-f63fee03ea65", "472285e8-0254-40e5-9039-761846df1e63", "48df77c7-2fd3-4cd2-979f-073d858808c9", "6964b96c-4534-4f46-983e-9237a365345e", "6fbd6e3c-ffdc-4c45-81ef-bc3c2e984baa", "76d9cce3-6d3f-4cc3-b623-d1c54d7d1eed", "7bf50639-a674-4a63-a94c-7d9b9542bb3e", "7f660026-0244-49dc-b719-cc778c09e003", "aac2eece-00f1-4f6b-9d8f-9cd6253ddc5f", "b565507b-c68a-4844-a690-50e6231aa8dd", "be374527-3ceb-496f-a479-3364f03183c9", "c8b81397-fc0a-4f12-9ae1-342ab77cea62", "c9c06a87-c473-4d29-853c-028163efbb2d", "cd662ddd-659f-4075-a415-e45c9a9d94c9", "dcdf965f-d02c-41ba-8f44-a325ab01965c", "e30ac6eb-d7b6-48c6-8f46-66ed381d833e", "fc76cb26-39e8-4dab-8642-edc06f8fa74b"], "title": "Efficient construction of approximate call graphs for JavaScript IDE services", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "74c8b507-4613-4239-bdb9-9950b20e53f3"}
{"abstract": "With the growing complexity of software applications, there is an increasing demand for solutions to distribute workload into server pools. Grid Computing provides powerful -- but also highly complex -- mechanisms to realize such tasks. Also, there is a steadily growing number of downtime-critical applications, requiring redundant servers to ensure service availability in case of component failures. To cope with the demand for server redundancy and service availability, the IETF has recently standardized the lightweight Reliable Server Pooling (RSerPool) framework, which is a common architecture for server pool and session management. In this paper, we first introduce the concept of RSerPool and then present the modeling thoughts of RSPLIB and the underlying general groupware design. Based on RSPLIB, we will illustratively show how to easily develop applications on top of RSerPool. We will also offer an application evaluation example for a proof-of-concept setup to distribute ray-tracing computation workload into a compute pool.", "authors": ["Xing Zhou", "Thomas Dreibholz", "Martin Becke", "Jobin Pulinthanath", "Erwin P.

{"abstract": "During the last decade, multidimensional databases have become common in the business and scientific worlds. Analysis places significant demands on the interfaces to these databases. It must be possible for analysts to easily and incrementally change both the data and their views of it as they cycle between hypothesis and experimentation.   In this paper, we address these demands by presenting the Polaris formalism, a visual query language for precisely describing a wide range of table-based graphical presentations of data. This language compiles into both the queries and drawing commands necessary to generate the visualization, enabling us to design systems that closely integrate analysis and visualization. Using the Polaris formalism, we have built an interactive interface for exploring multidimensional databases that analysts can use to rapidly and incrementally build an expressive range of views of their data as they engage in a cycle of visual analysis.", "authors": ["Chris Stolte", "Diane Tang", "Pat Hanrahan"], "n_citation": 89, "references": ["51685519-0af2-422c-9d4d-e5b2d7d1fea0", "67bc5445-b518-42e0-8b9b-0b7fa1ba82be", "83ddda6f-1570-47fa-8ddb-a82ee72f8ecf", "c18dddc5-3483-4933-9333-a29855be1042", "d83820fe-282a-4d92-86ca-cd91fea7cf4b"], "title": "Polaris: a system for query, analysis, and visualization of multidimensional databases", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2008, "id": "74cb5556-7615-40a4-ba0b-956799eac7ec"}

Thus the human and program can interact on a symmetrical and equal basis through the medium of the graphic monitor.

{"abstract": "Introduction    Student enrollment in college computer science (CS) and information technology (IT) programs are in a downward trend in most developed countries. At the same time, the U.S. Bureau of Labor and their counterparts in other countries forecast an increased need for skilled CS/IT graduates.   To reverse the downwards trend in college level CS/IT enrollment, ACM launched the Computer Science Teachers Association (csta.acm.org), whose mission is to \"directly and passionately\" advocate for computer science education in the high school.   One major initiative is to develop a comprehensive computer science curriculum that educates high school students and informs them about the profession because a major factor in the enrollment decline is a lack of knowledge about possible CS/IT careers. In this article, we examine one CS/IT program (the Cisco Networking Academy that has been offered in high schools since 1978) to understand what lessons we can draw for other CS/IT high school initiatives.", "authors": ["Alan R.

{"abstract": "Architecture definition languages (ADLs) enable the formalization of the architecture of software systems and the execution of preliminary analyses on them. These analyses aim at supporting the identification and solution of design problems in the early stages of software development. We have used ADLs to describe middleware-induced architectural styles. These styles describe the assumptions and constraints that middleware infrastructures impose on the architecture of systems. Our work originates from the belief that the explicit representation of these styles at the architectural level can guide designers in the definition of an architecture compliant with a pre-selected middleware infrastructure, or, conversely can support designers in the identification of the most suitable middleware infrastructure for a specific architecture. In this paper we provide an evaluation of ADLs as to their suitability for defining middleware-induced architectural styles. We identify new requirements for ADLs, and we highlight the importance of existing capabilities. Although our experimentation starts from an attempt to solve a specific problem, the results we have obtained provide general lessons about ADLs, learned from defining the architecture of existing, complex, distributed, running systems.", "authors": ["E.

{"abstract": "In this paper the Fokker-Planck equation is solved by the meshless particle partition of unity finite element method with automatic boundary condition enforcement. An improved cover generation algorithm is presented to automatically minimize interference between boundary nodes and interior nodes in the solution domain. Radial basis functions are used at boundary nodes to automatically damp the solution to a desired small value at boundaries, thus eliminating the need of penalty method for boundary condition enforcement. This achieves two important goals: (i) improves the conditioning of discretized reduced order system and (ii) eliminates spurious modes created by penalty method, thus improving the quality of point spectrum of the discretized Fokker-Planck operator. This is particularly important for systems without stationary solution, in which spurious modes can prevent the construction of accurate approximation. Results shown for a two dimensional nonlinear oscillator with stationary solution agree well with our former results while also decreasing the total number of spurious modes significantly. Further, an undamped simple pendulum is examined to demonstrate the applicability of this method for systems without stationary solution.", "authors": ["Yifei Sun", "Mrinal Kumar"], "n_citation": 8, "references": ["c0613f1a-5d4e-4ca3-a507-313e7c9691b1", "cdfb9c3a-0e49-4cdb-a034-ad66f533a4f4"], "title": "A meshless p-PUFEM Fokker-Planck equation solver with automatic boundary condition enforcement", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "75a6d08f-ca89-464a-abda-616796a90d7b"}

{"abstract": "Reinforcement learning methods are often considered as a potential solution to enable a robot to adapt to changes in real time to an unpredictable environment. However, with continuous action, only a few existing algorithms are practical for real-time learning. In such a setting, most effective methods have used a parameterized policy structure, often with a separate parameterized value function. The goal of this paper is to assess such actor-critic methods to form a fully specified practical algorithm. Our specific contributions include 1) developing the extension of existing incremental policy-gradient algorithms to use eligibility traces, 2) an empirical comparison of the resulting algorithms using continuous actions, 3) the evaluation of a gradient-scaling technique that can significantly improve performance. Finally, we apply our actor-critic algorithm to learn on a robotic platform with a fast sensorimotor cycle (10ms). Overall, these results constitute an important step towards practical real-time learning control with continuous action.", "authors": ["Thomas Degris", "Patrick M. Pilarski", "Richard S.

{"abstract": "A nonlinear current-mode proportional-integral (PI) controller is proposed for the challenging problem of regulating the output voltage of a dc/dc boost power converter. For the analysis, the accurate average nonlinear model of the boost converter is used, while a new advanced passivity-based nonlinear stability analysis is applied. Particularly, it is firstly proven that the closed-loop system is passive and a unique equilibrium exists. A new sequential method is proposed for constructing a suitable Lyapunov storage function for the entire closed-loop system, which is capable to prove the input- to-state stability of the system. All these properties are eventually used to prove convergence to the desired equilibrium. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed PI controller is evaluated through simulation and experimental results for cases where step changes on the voltage reference value occur.", "authors": ["Konstantinos F.

{"abstract": "In this paper, the popular proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) without the usual integral or inner product constraints is extended to general Hilbert spaces, such as Sobolev spaces, using functional analytic methods. It is shown that a particular tensor product space is dense in the Hilbert space where the partial differential equation (PDE) solution lives. This allows approximating the PDE solution by tensors to any desired accuracy. Optimal approximation by these tensors is shown to result in the POD using operator theoretic arguments. This is achieved by solving a nonlinear optimization problem where the PDE solution is approximated by operators of a prescribed finite rank in the corresponding trace class 2 norm. POD modes can then be computed by solving an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem using Hilbert-Schmidt theory. Moreover, an optimal method in constructing reduced order models for the two-dimensional Burgers' equation subject to boundary control is presented and compared to the POD reduced models.

{"abstract": "Most risk analysis tools and techniques require the user to enter a good deal of information before they can provide useful diagnoses. In this paper, we describe an approach to enable the user to obtain a COTS glue code integration risk analysis with no inputs other than the set of glue code cost drivers the user submits to get a glue code integration effort estimate with the COnstructive COTS integration cost estimation (COCOTS) tool. The risk assessment approach is built on a knowledge base with 24 risk identification rules and a 3-level risk probability weighting scheme obtained from an expert Delphi analysis. Each risk rule is defined as one critical combination of two COCOTS cost drivers that may cause certain undesired outcome if they are both rated at their worst case ratings. The 3-level nonlinear risk weighting scheme represents the relative probability of risk occurring with respect to the individual cost driver ratings from the input. Further, to determine the relative risk impact, we use the productivity range of each cost driver in the risky combination to reflect the cost consequence of risk occurring. We also develop a prototype called COCOTS Risk Analyzer to automate our risk assessment method. The evaluation of our approach shows that it has done an effective job of estimating the relative risk levels of both small USC e-services and large industry COTS-based applications.", "authors": ["Ye Yang", "Barry W.

The main aim of this work is used to monitor the different workstations at industries using Zigbee devices and to correspondingly cut off the power to the particular workstation when it is in idle state without distracting the other workstations. The issues related with power and transmission range of the proposed work are discussed.", "authors": ["M. Barathi Kannamma", "B. Chanthini", "D.

{"abstract": "The web has become the largest data repository on the planet. An important factor contributing to its success is its openness and ease of use: anyone can contribute data to, and consume data from, the Web. As Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the Web, said, \"the exciting thing is serendipitous reuse of data: one person puts data up there for one thing, and another person uses it another way.\" Such serendipitous data reuse is extremely valuable. Through reuse, new knowledge can be created, innovation and value-added services become possible.   However, there have been efforts to regulate and legally challenge data reuse activities. The European Union (EU) has adopted the Database Directive to restrict unauthorized data extraction and reuse. In the U.S., Congress has considered six bills, all of which failed to pass into law. These legislative activities are summarized in Figure 1; more details are furnished later. The significant uncertainty and the international differences in database legislation have created serious challenges to the \"serendipitous reuse of data.\" The dual purposes of this article, both related to the theme \"one size does  not  fit all,\" are to: summarize the range of legislation in current use and proposed; and present an economic model for interpreting or recommending policy choices that depend on factors such as cost of database creation and level of database differentiation.   As computing professionals continue to develop technologies (such as data extraction, Web mashups, Web services, and various Semantic Web technologies) to make data reuse much easier, it is important for us to understand the legal implications when applying these technologies for data reuse purposes.", "authors": ["Hongwei Zhu", "Stuart E.

{"abstract": "This paper investigates a state estimation set-membership approach for fault detection of a benchmark wind turbine. The main challenges in the benchmark are high noise on the wind speed measurement and the nonlinearities in the aerodynamic torque such that the overall model of the turbine is nonlinear. We use an effective wind speed estimator to estimate the effective wind speed and then using interval analysis and monotonicity of the aerodynamic torque with respect to the effective wind speed, we can apply the method to the nonlinear system. The fault detection algorithm checks the consistency of the measurement with a closed set that is computed based on the past measurements and a model of the system. If the measurement is not consistent with this set, a fault is detected. The result demonstrates effectiveness of the method for fault detection of the benchmark wind turbine.", "authors": ["Seyed Mojtaba Tabatabaeipour", "Peter Fogh Odgaard", "Thomas Bak"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["307bd8c8-f9c6-47c4-8c95-fb73c41be0e8", "37dd36ab-ec04-4b9f-a725-288f8fb37f93", "70d5d7cc-35f4-4d43-be12-16e7ce3fdc4f", "c5b42085-d481-4ef5-8388-dac8b7b85611"], "title": "Fault detection of a benchmark wind turbine using interval analysis", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "774d2a59-47b2-4dfb-bea2-7b883f4abd70"}

{"abstract": "Many software development organisations today adopt global software engineering (GSE) and agile models; requiring software engineers to collaborate and develop software in flexible, distributed, online teams. However, many employers have expressed concern that graduates lack teamwork skills and one of the most commonly occurring problems with GSE models are issues with project management. Team managers and educators often oversee a number of teams and the large corpus of data, in combination with agile models, make it difficult to efficiently assess factors such as team role distribution and emotional climate.   Current methods and tools for monitoring software engineering (SE) teamwork in both industry and education settings typically focus on member contributions, reflection, or product outcomes, which are limited in terms of real-time feedback and accurate behavioural analysis. We have created a dashboard that extracts and communicates team role distribution and team emotion information in real-time. Our proof of concept provides a real-time analysis of teamwork discussions and visualises team member emotions, the roles they have adopted and overall team sentiment during the course of a collaborative problem-solving project. We demonstrate and discuss how such a tool could be useful for SE team management and training and the development of teamwork skills in SE university courses.", "authors": ["Rebecca Vivian", "Hamid Tarmazdi", "Katrina E.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a robust control scheme that prevents an autonomous 4WS4WD vehicle from lane departure and wheel skidding in presence of road curvature and aerodynamic drag. The control objectives can be specified as various closed-loop specifications, such as lane keeping, wheel slip constraint and disturbance attenuation. An LMI approach is used to deal with these objectives simultaneously, which combines the quadratic stabilization technique with constraints on inputs.

It is presented and applied in a laboratory test case which is representative of low-cost navigation for ground vehicles. The method exploits the dynamics of a scalar field obtained by weighting and averaging the brightness perceived by two embedded neighboring cameras. To be more specific, the cameras are complemented with a gyrometer to retrieve the curvilinear velocity of the moving rigid body. The proposed method is first tested on synthetic data, then on real data, and shows robustness to poor quality of image data.

{"abstract": "Touchscreen-based devices such as smartphones and tablets are gaining popularity, but their rich input capabilities pose new development and testing complications. To alleviate this problem, we present an approach and tool named Reran that permits record-and-replay for the Android smartphone platform. Existing GUI-level record-and-replay approaches are inadequate due to the expressiveness of the smartphone domain, in which applications support sophisticated GUI gestures, depend on inputs from a variety of sensors on the device, and have precise timing requirements among the various input events. We address these challenges by directly capturing the low-level event stream on the phone, which includes both GUI events and sensor events, and replaying it with microsecond accuracy. Moreover, Reran does not require access to app source code, perform any app rewriting, or perform any modifications to the virtual machine or Android platform. We demonstrate RERAN's applicability in a variety of scenarios, including (a) replaying 86 out of the Top-100 Android apps on Google Play; (b) reproducing bugs in popular apps, e.g., Firefox, Facebook, Quickoffice; and (c) fast-forwarding executions. We believe that our versatile approach can help both Android developers and researchers.", "authors": ["Lorenzo Gomez", "Iulian Neamtiu", "Tanzirul Azim", "Todd D.

{"abstract": "For the operation of Autonomous Mobile Robot (AMR) in unknown environments, accurate estimation of internal parameters and consequently precise prediction of the battery state of charge (SoC) are critical issues for power management. Battery performance can be affected by factors such as temperature deviation, discharge/charge current, Coulombic efficiency losses, and aging. Thus, in order to increase the model accuracy, it is important to update the model parameters online. In this paper, the Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) is employed for the online estimation of the Lithium-Ion battery model parameters and the battery SoC based on the updated model. The proposed method is evaluated experimentally, and the results are compared with that of the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The comparison with the EKF shows that UKF provides better accuracy both in battery parameters estimation and the battery SoC estimation.", "authors": ["Maral Partovibakhsh", "Guangjun Liu"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["0e4cf456-8cea-449a-afd4-89b2c07a2db6", "29b46504-ae8a-4dbc-954d-90cd09990d59", "440f0e23-199c-4e06-b6bb-d36937677ef0", "581949bb-0499-4250-834d-68687e13e726", "674182fe-308b-4677-9e4e-da84c0be810d", "71fdd256-f2e4-45a7-a597-a66a322d5b6a"], "title": "Online estimation of model parameters and state-of-charge of Lithium-Ion battery using Unscented Kalman Filter", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "78c0488a-26d6-46f7-8c2b-139835420fbd"}

{"abstract": "Several studies have shown that automated testing is a promising approach to save significant amounts of time and money in the industry of reactive software. But automated testing requires a formal framework and adequate means to generate test data. In the context of synchronous reactive software, we have built such a framework and its associated tool-Lutess-to integrate various well-founded testing techniques. This tool automatically constructs test harnesses for fully automated test data generation and verdict return. The generation conforms to different formal descriptions: software environment constraints, functional and safety-oriented properties to be satisfied by the software, software operational profiles and software behavior patterns. These descriptions are expressed in an extended executable temporal logic. They correspond to more and more complex test objectives raised by the first pre-industrial applications of Lutess. This paper concentrates on the latest development of the tool and its use in the validation of standard feature specifications in telephone systems. The four testing techniques which are coordinated in Lutess uniform framework are shown to be well-suited to efficient software testing. The lessons learnt from the use of Lutess in the context of industrial partnerships are discussed.", "authors": ["L. du Bousquet", "F. Ouabdesselam", "Jean-Luc Richier", "N.

{"abstract": "At Carnegie Mellon University in Silicon Valley, the graduate master program ends with a practicum project during which students serve as software engineering consultants for an industry client. In this context, students are challenged to demonstrate their ability to work on self-managing and self-organizing teams. This paper presents a field study of the Software Engineering Method and Theory (SEMAT) Essence framework. The objective is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Essence\u2019s novel state-based monitoring and goal-driven steering approach provided by the Essence kernel alphas and their states. The researchers conducted the study on seven graduate master student teams applying the approach throughout their practicum projects. The research methodology involves weekly observation and recording of each team\u2019s state progression and collecting students\u2019 reflection on the application of the approach. The main result validates that the approach provides student teams with a holistic, lightweight, non-prescriptive and method-agnostic way to monitor progress and steer projects, as well as an effective structure for team reflection and risk management. The paper also validates that the Essence kernel provides an effective mechanism for monitoring and steering work common to most student software projects. This includes the work done during project initiation as well as the work done at the project or release level. Support for technical work should come from additional practices added on top of the kernel, or by extending or altering the kernel definition. The conclusion is that the approach enables students to learn to steer projects effectively by addressing the various dimensions of software engineering. Hence the approach could be leveraged in software engineering education.", "authors": ["C\u00e9cile P\u00e9raire", "Todd Sedano"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["5b065887-03d4-40c7-9eef-39d3e85e93c4", "5b37129e-61bf-494a-9e15-ec0e862d10ed", "98a17402-ccc6-434c-93da-4888fce210c5", "ca76cf8f-d013-4dc6-b016-c991eee67260"], "title": "State-based monitoring and goal-driven project steering: field study of the SEMAT essence framework", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "7929c61c-4005-453b-8de6-635b832c4866"}

{"abstract": "The value of software inspection for uncovering defects early in the development lifecycle has been well documented. Of the various types of inspection methods published to date, experiments have shown perspective-based inspection to be one of the most effective, because of its enhanced coverage of the defect space. However, inspections in general, and perspective-based inspections in particular, have so far been applied predominantly in the context of conventional structured development methods, and then almost always to textual artifacts, such as requirements documents or code modules. Object-oriented models, particularly of the graphical form, have so far not been adequately addressed by inspection methods. This paper tackles this problem by first discussing the difficulties involved in tailoring the perspective-based inspection approach to object-oriented development methods and, second, by presenting a generalization of the approach which overcomes these limitations.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a promising approach to systematically testing graphical user interfaces (GUI) in a platform independent manner. Our framework uses standard computer vision techniques through a python-based scripting language (Sikuli script) to identify key graphical elements in the screen and automatically interact with these elements by simulating keypresses and pointer clicks. The sequence of inputs and outputs resulting from the interaction is analyzed using grammatical inference techniques that can infer the likely internal states and transitions of the GUI based on the observations. Our framework handles a wide variety of user interfaces ranging from traditional pull down menus to interfaces built for mobile platforms such as Android and iOS. Furthermore, the automaton inferred by our approach can be used to check for potentially harmful patterns in the interface's internal state machine such as design inconsistencies (eg,. a keypress does not have the intended effect) and mode confusion that can make the interface hard to use. We describe an implementation of the framework and demonstrate its working on a variety of interfaces including the user-interface of a safety critical insulin infusion pump that is commonly used by type-1 diabetic patients.", "authors": ["Paul Givens", "Aleksandar Chakarov", "Sriram Sankaranarayanan", "Tom Yeh"], "n_citation": 7, "references": ["0278bce3-e509-4ae6-b130-87a283a4b819", "2c2beb4f-8ffc-4e3e-9934-6c07962a70fe", "3073f57f-161e-4aac-8279-d9f0276b6be3", "475bae33-d3a5-4041-a49f-3d85b6c1a3c1", "4c84a71f-6c0d-4ad8-a24a-d149931be474", "5d70f293-e310-41d2-864a-9f2ab43ae80c", "61aafd5b-ea5f-4ec5-b9ee-69486328241b", "97f9b259-d519-48b8-847b-0c1893b91494", "9a431a4b-1381-4eb4-b761-8311250ca2ab", "9e6b1b04-8b88-4fa2-bb3b-eea47d1ea25d", "a37bac2e-5ffb-4607-b163-c26d23d30af6", "a8974e64-f3e5-45c0-97b7-b03f366348a0", "b00751e7-c8b6-4994-bff8-d893cea18731", "bd20c3c8-f7cc-403d-bf4c-bc5181604608", "e2f2c3b6-64c2-41ba-a75f-6aa62b614ac0"], "title": "Exploring the internal state of user interfaces by combining computer vision techniques with grammatical inference", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "796d61f3-10da-40fd-b344-fb09abe8b955"}

{"abstract": "A class of algorithms is presented for maintaining self-organizing sequential search lists, where the only permutation applied is to move the accessed record of each search some distance towards the front of the list. During searches, these algorithms retain a back-pointer to a previous probed record in order to determine the destination of the accessed record's eventual move. The back-pointer does not traverse the list, but rather it is advanced occasionally to point to the record just probed by the search algorithm. This avoids the cost of a second traversal through a significant portion of the list, which may be a significant savings when each record access may require a new page to be brought into primary memory. Probabilistic functions for deciding when to advance the pointer are presented and analyzed. These functions demonstrate average case complexities of measures such as asymptotic cost and convergence, similar to some of the more common list update algorithms in the literature. In cases where the accessed record is moved forward a distance proportional to the distance to the front of the list, the use of these functions may save up to 50 percent of the time required for permuting the list.", "authors": ["James H.

{"abstract": "Introduction    The established philosophy within the software development industry is that an organization implementing a program to improve software quality can expect to recoup the cost of the implementation many times over through the reduced cost associated with improvements in quality. Measurement initiatives are perceived to provide a key contribution to quality improvement as evidenced by the focus of early measurement based initiatives and the place of measurement in the higher echelons of process initiatives. In general, organizations pursue measurement initiatives from a perspective that, without measurement, control is not possible. While organizations recognize that there are potential benefits to measuring their processes and products, however, they typically find it difficult to structure ad-hoc measures into a formal program -- a situation that is compounded by the significant cost of implementing such programs. Although these problems have led to some organizations moving away from measurement programs, many companies still use measurement programs as illustrated by the continued interest in, for example, the Capability Maturity Model. Given the appetite and potential returns on investment of measurement frameworks and initiatives, ways of successfully implementing them are important.   With that importance in mind, this work evaluates the implementation of such a measurement framework in a major Insurance organization. A hybrid model -- practitioner-based -- was devised to incorporate the best aspects of current approaches and mitigate identified shortcomings. In order to continually improve software quality, research was conducted to understand the critical success factors in implementing software measurement programs, develop a measurement framework to address the critical success factors, implement a pilot program based on that framework, and reflect on the outcomes of implementation for future practice. We examine existing measurement frameworks in order to assess the critical success factors and the relative strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches in relation to those factors and describe the model that results from the outcomes of the analysis of strengths and weaknesses of existing approaches. Later, we describe the implementation of a pilot of the model in an established IT department and evaluate the success of the pilot and the implications for the state-of-the-art.", "authors": ["S. T.

{"abstract": "This paper describes the implementation of a dictation system for Malayalam office documents in OpenOffice Writer. Dictation system is built using state-of-the-art large vocabulary continuous speech recognition system for the Malayalam language. This system supports a vocabulary of 5000 most commonly used office domain words and is employed with a vocabulary updating facility to handle out-of-vocabulary words. The system is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM), trained with huge (25 hours) amount of data. The training data is collected in room environment, ensuring the speaker variance and the phonetic richness. A hybrid model which integrates the rule based method with statistical method is used to handle the pronunciation variations for the creation of the pronunciation dictionary. The system is first of its kind which simplifies the tedious task of typing in Malayalam. Apart from dictating office documents with 75 \u00b15 % accuracy, the system is equipped with a facility of suggestion generation by which the user will be provided with alternate words for mis-recognized words. The system also supports some basic voice command operations for file operations like open, save, close etc. This system has an option to adapt to the user's voice which will improve the recognition accuracy by 2-5%.

{"abstract": "We consider an online (real-time) control problem that involves an agent performing a discrete-time random walk over a finite state space. The agent's action at each time step is to specify the probability distribution for the next state given the current state. Following the set-up of Todorov (2007, 2009), the state-action cost at each time step is a sum of a nonnegative state cost and a control cost given by the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the agent's next-state distribution and that determined by some fixed passive dynamics. The online aspect of the problem is due to the fact that the state cost functions are generated by a dynamic environment, and the agent learns the current state cost only after having selected the corresponding action. We give an explicit construction of an efficient strategy that has small regret (i.e., the difference between the total state-action cost incurred causally and the smallest cost attainable using noncausal knowledge of the state costs) under mild regularity conditions on the passive dynamics.

{"abstract": "Although encipherment has often been discussed as a means to protect computer data, its costs are not well established. Five experiments were conducted to measure the cpu time on a CDC 6400 required by additive ciphers programmed both in assembly language and in Fortran: a \u201cnull transformation\u201d to measure the time to move data without encipherment; encipherment with a one-word key; encipherment with a 125-word key; double key encipherment; and encipherment using a pseudo random key. The results were analyzed for consistency over 100 runs, and the effects of constant and intermittent errors were considered.  Timing rates for assembly language encipherment ranged from 498,800 characters per second for a pseudo random key cipher to 2,092,000 characters per second for a constant one-word key cipher. The latter is almost equivalent to the rate required simply to move data without encipherment. Fortran tests required over four times as much cpu time.

{"abstract": "In this work we consider the modeling and the design of control allocation algorithms for an innovative prototype of ducted-fan aerial robot characterized by a redundant number of aerodynamic control surfaces. The control allocation algorithms are designed to combine the effects of the aerodynamic forces produced by deflecting the control surfaces in order to generate a desired resultant control wrench vector. It is shown how, employing also the aerodynamic drag forces, additional control inputs can be generated to improve the number of degrees of freedom that can be actually governed by the control law. The proposed solutions are then compared both in term of energy efficiency and control properties by taking advantage of a detailed model of the system.", "authors": ["Roberto Naldi", "Lorenzo Marconi"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["65284528-d2c0-40ca-af65-a45a210b5dd4", "fab25def-477d-4703-a765-4bbcca7943d2"], "title": "Control allocation for a ducted-fan aerial robot employing both lift and drag forces", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "79d6aacb-2e97-475c-991b-6dfd7a54ca21"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, evolution of a multi agent system (MAS) in n-D space where n+1 or more leader agents located on the boundary guide the MAS is studied. We consider the MAS as a deformable body whose motion can be prescribed by a homogeneous map determined by the initial and current positions of the leaders. Each follower agent learns this leader prescribed motion plan by local communication with adjacent agents. In previous work we assumed that each follower communicates with n+1 adjacent agent (1-7). Here we relax that constraint to include more than 3 adjacent agents by choosing a polyhedral communication topology where the vertices are local agents that are adjacent to a follower agent i. The polytope encloses the follower agent i and is the union of sub-polyhedra, with one of the n+1 vertices occupied by agent i. volume weights are defined based on the initial position of follower i and the set of adjacent agents to . The motion proceeds by updating the position of every follower agent such that volume weights in intermediate configurations of the MAS are close to the initial volume weights. This update strategy maneuvers the MAS to its final desired formation as a homogenous map of its initial configuration.", "authors": ["Hossein Rastgoftar", "Suhada Jayasuriya"], "n_citation": 6, "references": ["2975d238-e0f5-465b-be1a-9c5a787ea61d", "980eaf23-9b8b-4396-871f-79779373792c", "ceda2cf7-cf49-4189-9908-2c42201e5bf2", "fd726c1c-2f74-4000-877e-a5ae031a0f3f"], "title": "Continuum evolution of multi agent systems under a polyhedral communication topology", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2014, "id": "79fa69e8-11fe-4185-b1f4-7b88d8f29132"}

In addition to robustness against unknown but bounded disturbances, the controller presented here is also able to deal with constraints on inputs and states due to its formulation as an RMPC. The proposed approach represents an extension of previous Model Predictive Control (MPC) laws based on the concept of constraint restriction (i.e. optimal trajectories via MPC are computed subject to stringent constraints assuming no uncertainty, and a linear local controller ensures that the actual system robustly follows the optimized MPC trajectory). The presented controller carries a low computational complexity overhead, making it attractive for real-time applications.

Fixed-head drum and moving-head disk storage units are considered, and emphasis is placed on the relative merits of the MTPT scheduling discipline with respect to the shortest-latency-time-first (SLTF) scheduling discipline. The results of the simulation studies presented show that neither scheduling discipline is unconditionally superior to the other. For most fixed-head drum applications, the SLTF discipline is preferable to MTPT, but for intra-cylinder disk scheduling the MTPT discipline offers a distinct advantage over the SLTF discipline. The computational requirements of an algorithm that implements the MTPT scheduling discipline are shown to be comparable to SLTF algorithms. In both cases, the sorting procedure is the most time-consuming phase of the algorithm.", "authors": ["Samuel H.

{"abstract": "Most application code evolves incrementally, and especially so when being maintained after the applications have been deployed. Yet, most data-flow analyses do not take advantage of this fact. Instead they require clients to recompute the entire analysis even if little code has changed\u2014a time consuming undertaking, especially with large libraries or when running static analyses often, e.g., on a continuous-integration server. In this work, we present Reviser, a novel approach for automatically and efficiently updating inter-procedural dataflow analysis results in response to incremental program changes. Reviser follows a clear-and-propagate philosophy, aiming at clearing and recomputing analysis information only where required, thereby greatly reducing the required computational effort. The Reviser algorithm is formulated as an extension to the IDE framework for Inter-procedural Finite Distributed Environment problems and automatically updates arbitrary IDE-based analyses.

{"abstract": "If the ultimate aim of a computing network is resource sharing, then the human component as well as the technical component of networking must be fully investigated to achieve this goal. This research is a first step toward assisting the user in participating in the vast store of resources available on a network.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a novel Multiclass Steganalysis process, for colored JPEG images using Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) as classifier. The feature set used for classification of images consists of 810 features consisting of 405 Markov features and 405 calibrated Markov features. The Markov features are based on Markov random process applied on correlations among JPEG coefficients of the image. The calibrated Markov features are the difference between the Markov features of the image and Markov features of a reference image, obtained by decompressing, cropping and recompressing the image. It is evident from the experiments that our proposed multi-class steganalysis method show good performance results in classifying the stego-images into their respective classes; these classes correspond to the embedding steganography techniques. The other advantage of the proposed method is its fast speed which is due to ELM as the learning process of ELM is very fast.", "authors": ["Veenu Bhasin", "Punam Bedi"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["013301b3-835b-4d4a-a61b-122744f791f4", "13e6a1f7-706f-42f4-b412-4f56e67e2df6", "24f4d12f-46d3-48c3-873f-353c99b0f939", "33abc1fc-50ea-4837-a4a0-65c1d4c0e0b7", "4cb4c075-d9ce-4a51-9136-46fe25f4202f", "65e6f86f-ed94-45fa-ae13-1a5f73932f66", "7f545424-7717-4d42-b5de-f2951cbe2d8c", "83bbfa05-80e8-4296-bf82-a32aa0417cc4", "8ce3d4d9-eee8-4717-a4ff-4d638b903373", "8e931246-0c37-4d6e-ad4d-104b2a2f6c93", "c87be67e-9976-45bb-8775-1753f1b59f92", "d2408db2-ee65-4231-944d-94f9dcbdfb95", "e4eb0466-6055-4497-9069-665ecb539387", "e6f306a6-defe-4368-bea9-af89f7b9667e", "ede1647d-c81d-46f2-a3b9-b7166f7d5554", "f8008882-bb79-4774-a7ba-829f76d83cfb"], "title": "Multi-class JPEG Steganalysis using Extreme Learning Machine", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "7ab10de1-7247-4b12-8183-5d1827ee05e3"}

This improvement process is aimed at the global software process model as well as methods and tools supporting that model. The basic idea is to use defect profiles to help characterize the environment and evaluate the project goals and the effectiveness of methods and tools in a quantitative way. The improvement process is implemented iteratively by setting project improvement goals, characterizing those goals and the environment, in part, via defect profiles in a quantitative way, choosing methods and tools fitting those characteristics, evaluating the actual behavior of the chosen set of methods and tools, and refining the project goals based on the evaluation results.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a domain specific process to assist the verification of observer-based fault detection software. Observer-based fault detection systems, like control systems, yield invariant properties of quadratic types. These quadratic invariants express both safety properties of the software such as the boundedness of the states and correctness properties such as the absence of false alarms from the fault detector. We seek to leverage these quadratic invariants, in an automated fashion, for the formal verification of the fault detection software. The approach, referred to as the credible autocoding framework [1], can be characterized as autocoding with proofs. The process starts with the fault detector model, along with its safety and correctness properties, all expressed formally in a synchronous modeling environment such as Simulink. The model is then transformed by a prototype credible autocoder into both code and analyzable annotations for the code. We demonstrate the credible autocoding process on a running example of an output observer fault detector for a 3-degrees-of-freedom (3DOF) helicopter control system.", "authors": ["Timothy Wang", "Alireza Esna Ashari", "Romain Jobredeaux", "Eric Feron"], "n_citation": 6, "references": ["05b3f309-98f7-4cbc-bc3e-b2f66514db94", "182cc081-d7ee-45be-8f61-0c12e3119438", "29a0ec84-5875-48f0-b225-a88fa01282ee", "35c8c06c-2ad0-46b4-9e92-2d684f3abd94", "3e377e7f-c2c7-405e-a5f3-6a9bf8d6f498", "494226c4-cafa-4d85-938e-0d99e0b6762d", "4c81e56b-b624-4567-9c29-45d931f70b1f", "54f6bf36-0c77-47f2-a6a2-0b07d24c291d", "6d4458b3-1a92-4f84-b4ed-556be7407c05", "812763a3-fdfa-48e4-bbd6-447d4f798443"], "title": "Credible autocoding of fault detection observers", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2014, "id": "7adf49ed-0878-4ba6-a19f-d6773c8d047e"}

In effect, we must teach a discipline broader than SE or CS alone for SE education to be effective.

{"abstract": "Many nonlinear systems can be modeled by or converted to strict-feedback forms, whose stabilization problem without modeling uncertainties has been extensively discussed in the literature. However, in practice, inevitable modeling uncertainties, especially co-existence of parametric uncertainties and nonparametric uncertainties, will make it very difficult and challenging to achieve desirable control performance. In this background, we consider a challenging adaptive control problem, aiming at asymptotic tracking to any bounded reference signal, in the presence of periodic uncertainties of both parametric and nonparametric types, i.e., periodic time-varying parameters and periodic unknown time-delays in the uncertain nonlinearities, for a class of strict-feedback discrete-time nonlinear systems due to the lack of related research and the increasing demand of digital control in current epoch. To deal with the co-existing various uncertainties, which bring highly-nonlinear coupled effects to the closed-loop system, a novel nearest-neighbor previous instant compensation technique, combined with the lifting approach and the future states prediction, is introduced in this paper to asymptotically fully compensate the effects of uncertainties. With such elaborately constructed adaptive estimation mechanism, the developed discrete-time backstepping adaptive controller can guarantee the closed-loop stability as well as asymptotic output tracking, which have been rigorously established and testified by extensive simulations.", "authors": ["Chenguang Yang", "Hongbin Ma", "Bin Xu", "Mengyin Fu"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["383fdeb6-9e21-42f7-9f64-aae825d3e769", "58233959-0376-43e0-a6eb-5ece912506ea", "5c4d1d7a-4663-4eeb-a750-6a5139b9b484", "8041c8b5-95c8-43e8-ac2c-14b0f6cd48ae", "83b73ec4-6490-41f1-9d90-378a1a5560fe", "858f0e95-d66b-48fe-ab11-36f6371b3c34", "8c71d26d-afe5-475e-a869-51195109d5cf", "9b037450-a877-462e-8a67-1706cc764d76", "a4708423-5562-480c-ac4a-eb52d8c4bd2d", "cc36aae0-40f8-4d05-85fb-d2e2c46d9652", "d1afc06f-9496-4152-a645-43163c858b7d", "f81010fa-fd52-4c28-ad6f-a84d7b15c262"], "title": "Adaptive control with nearest-neighbor previous instant compensation for discrete-time nonlinear strict-feedback systems", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "7b4828a7-6335-4dcf-a3a0-f697381275d4"}

{"abstract": "Logging is a common programming practice of practical importance to collect system runtime information for postmortem analysis. Strategic logging placement is desired to cover necessary runtime information without incurring unintended consequences ( e.g. , performance overhead, trivial logs). However, in current practice, there is a lack of rigorous specifications for developers to govern their logging behaviours. Logging has become an important yet tough decision which mostly depends on the domain knowledge of developers. To reduce the effort on making logging decisions, in this paper, we propose a \"learning to log\" framework, which aims to provide informative guidance on logging during development. As a proof of concept, we provide the design and implementation of a logging suggestion tool,  LogAdvisor , which automatically learns the common logging practices on  where to log  from existing logging instances and further leverages them for actionable suggestions to developers. Specifically, we identify the important factors for determining  where to log  and extract them as structural features, textual features, and syntactic features. Then, by applying machine learning techniques ( e.g. , feature selection and classifier learning) and noise handling techniques, we achieve high accuracy of logging suggestions. We evaluate  LogAdvisor  on two industrial software systems from Microsoft and two open-source software systems from GitHub (totally 19.1M LOC and 100.6K logging statements). The encouraging experimental results, as well as a user study, demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our logging suggestion tool. We believe our work can serve as an important first step towards the goal of \"learning to log\".", "authors": ["Jieming Zhu", "Pinjia He", "Qiang Fu", "Hongyu Zhang", "Michael R.

{"abstract": "During combustion mode switches, between homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) and spark ignition (SI) combustion, the engine will operate at throttled and stoichiometric conditions where high cyclic variability (CV) is typically observed. To analyze and eventually model the engine behavior at the high CV condition we perform measurements on a four-cylinder HCCI engine with negative valve overlap and describe a cycle-resolved analysis method that enables the characterization of cycle-to-cycle variations at such conditions. The dynamic behavior observed is characterized by the recycling of thermal and chemical energy between cycles. We quantify the cyclic exchange and relate it to the dynamic patterns that emerge from this high CV condition. We also clarify the contributions of the spark at these conditions, where advancing the spark can significantly reduce the variability. It is our conclusion that the dynamic patterns observed can be characterized by the cycle-resolved combustion efficiency as it is an essential non-linearity in the dynamic evolution.", "authors": ["Jacob Larimore", "Erik Hellstrom", "Jeff Sterniak", "Li Jiang", "Anna G.

The time complexity of this problem is analyzed both when k is considered to be a fixed integer and when k is considered to be a parameter of the test. In the first case, it is shown that for every k there exists an O(n k+2 ) algorithm for testing the LR(k) property, where n is the size of the grammar in question. On the other hand, if both k and the subject grammar are problem parameters, then the complexity of the problem depends very strongly on the representation chosen for k. More specifically, it is shown that this problem is NP-complete when k is expressed in unary. When k is expressed in binary the problem is complete for nondeterministic exponential time.

{"abstract": "Miniaturization in size of Medical ultrasound scanning machine made it to use in point of care applications. Lack of sonographers and their unwillingness to work in rural areas limit the benefits of ultrasound system in rural healthcare. Diagnosis of patients through ultrasound is done by visualizing the ultrasound scanned images of organs. Diagnosis through telemedicine involves transmitting of ultrasound images from rural locations to cloud, where sonographer can remotely access the ultrasound data from cloud and generate the report, thus reducing the geographical separation between patients and doctors. Due to lack of adequate sonographers, ultrasound scanning in remote areas is operated by semi-skilled clinicians. Most of the images generated by semi-skilled clinicians are not useful for diagnosis. Transmitting all these images increases the data in cloud, drains the battery of portable ultrasound machine and increases latency in medication. This paper provides automatic B-mode ultrasound image validation based on organ information present in the image for diagnosis, thus avoiding transmission of invalid images to cloud. Linear kernel SVM classifier trained with first order statistic features of image with/without organs is used to classify the images into valid and invalid for diagnosis. The algorithm resulted with a recognition efficiency of 94.2% in classifying the ultrasound images.", "authors": ["R.

The system under test (SUT), of which two different versions were tested by each of the two testers, is a professionally developed web-based data collection system that now is in use.     The two testers tested the same versions, had identical testing goals (to detect defects), had access to the same resources, but used different processes (i.e. manual without any automation vs. model-based with automatic test case generation and automatic test case execution). The testers did not interact with each other.     We compare the effectiveness (issues found) and efficiency (effort spent) of the two approaches. The results show, for example, that manual testing required less preparation time and that its test coverage was somewhat uneven. In contrast, MBT required more preparation time, was more systematic, and detected more issues. While the manual approach detected more inconsistencies between specified and actual text labels, MBT detected more functional issues.

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the efforts of applying rough set theory onto spatial clustering. Rough set theory utilizes the spatial structure of the data resulting in better pattern identification. The results of our proposed model are compared with the hard clustering methods such as single linkage, ward's and density based clustering which proves that the rough set based soft clustering converges data points faster.

The underlying graph of such a network at each time is generated by a martingale random process. We prove that consensus is reached almost surely if and only if the expected graph of the network contains a directed spanning tree. We then provide an example of a consensus seeking process based on local averaging of opinions in a dynamic model of social network formation which is a martingale. At each time step, individual agents randomly choose some other agents to interact with according to some arbitrary probabilities. The interaction is one-sided and results in the agent averaging her opinion with those of her randomly chosen neighbors based on the weights she assigns to them. Once an agent chooses a neighbor, the weights are updated in such a way that the expected values of the weights are preserved. We show that agents reach consensus in this random dynamical network almost surely.

Error density was high: 20 percent of the types contained 80 percent of the total frequency, which implies high potential effectiveness for software-based correction of Cobol. Surprisingly, only four high-frequency errors were error-prone, which implies minimal error inducing design. 80 percent of Cobol misspellings were classifiable in the four error categories of previous researchers, which implies that Cobol misspellings are correctable by existent algorithms. Reserved word usage was not error-prone, which implies minimal interference with usage of reserved words. Over 80 percent of error diagnosis was found to be inaccurate.

{"abstract": "IFRA, an acronym for Instruction Footprint Recording and Analysis, overcomes major challenges associated with a very expensive step in post-silicon validation of processors---pinpointing a bug location and the instruction sequence that exposes the bug from a system failure, such as a crash. Special on-chip recorders, inserted in a processor during design, collect instruction footprints---special information about flows of instructions, and what the instructions did as they passed through various microarchitectural blocks of the processor. The recording is done concurrently during the normal operation of the processor in a post-silicon system validation setup. Upon detection of a system failure, the recorded information is scanned out and analyzed offline for bug localization. Special self-consistency-based program analysis techniques, together with the test-program binary of the application executed during post-silicon validation, are used for this purpose. Major benefits of using IFRA over traditional techniques for post-silicon bug localization are (1) it does not require full system-level reproduction of bugs, and (2) it does not require full system-level simulation. Hence, it can overcome major hurdles that limit the scalability of traditional post-silicon validation methodologies.

{"abstract": "Agile methodologies have come a long way over the last decade. Several recent surveys show that agile methodologies like Scrum, Extreme Programming and, more recently, Kanban have been successfully adopted by many companies to develop their software. However, the same surveys show that only few of the agile practices are used and even fewer are applied consequently and thoroughly. This is to a great extent due to the lack of skilled personnel. Although teaching agile software development has drawn some attention in recent research and has been discussed in several papers, we do not yet seem to be able to \u201cdeliver\u201d the appropriately skilled personnel. What is the reason for this, and more importantly, how can we improve the situation? In this paper we propose a more holistic approach for teaching agile software development, in which the required agile practices and values are not only integrated theoretically into our courses but also practically applied and repeated until they become a habit to our graduates.

{"abstract": "This paper considers an approach to attenuation of uncertain stochastic disturbances for a linear discrete time invariant system. The statistical uncertainty is measured in terms of the mean anisotropy functional. The disturbance attenuation capabilities of the system are quantified by the anisotropic norm which is applied as a performance criterion. The designed anisotropic suboptimal controller is a static output feedback gain which is required to stabilize the closed-loop system and keep its anisotropic norm below a prescribed threshold value. The general static output feedback synthesis procedure implies solving a convex inequality on the determinant of a positive definite matrix and two linear matrix inequalities in reciprocal matrices which make the general optimization problem nonconvex. By applying some known standard convexification procedures it is shown that the resulting optimization problem is convex for some specific classes of plants defined by certain structural properties. In the convex cases, the anisotropic \u03b3-optimal controllers can be obtained by minimizing the squared norm threshold value subject to convex constraints. The proposed approach to the anisotropy-based optimization is novel as the static output feedback anisotropic controllers have not been considered before.", "authors": ["Michael M.

{"abstract": "Structured and unstructured data in operational support tools have long been prevalent in software engineering. Similar data is now becoming widely available in other domains. Software systems that utilize such operational data (OD) to help with software design and maintenance activities are increasingly being built despite the difficulties of drawing valid conclusions from disparate and low-quality data and the continuing evolution of operational support tools. This paper proposes systematizing approaches to the engineering of OD-based systems. To prioritize and structure research areas we consider historic developments, such as big data hype; synthesize defining features of OD, such as confounded measures and unobserved context; and discuss emerging new applications, such as diverse and large OD collections and extremely short development intervals. To sustain the credibility of OD-based systems more research will be needed to investigate effective existing approaches and to synthesize novel, OD-specific engineering principles.", "authors": ["Audris Mockus"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["02e0342a-33d3-4d3f-9f1d-b14081edbc39", "07a6d861-c9e6-4358-a99a-4b982edadcc3", "0da54302-8b73-441e-8999-f74b46b3614a", "12060e64-190b-4b01-9c48-234b93a3e0b1", "2cbe9255-f90d-4e50-bdd9-7cc2c3d50cc5", "33dd7ce8-453e-4824-b700-6d29d69d5502", "4e232861-adeb-4f86-a5d5-afe51189abd2", "53c4de09-1717-44ee-bdbe-770e7b8c9964", "5a7a4683-c9ae-4a47-8097-4929e006a9ce", "62b21ba2-0424-464f-aae4-2fe8ad2fcc00", "6e20566b-e2ce-420d-be2d-7283c85ad8de", "6fe35276-23de-4a2c-8c2f-32681e4b07cb", "721b94db-6ed6-41ae-9e73-d357349d8403", "73907c70-56ad-49f4-a4e8-6d29f0a0e6a6", "8060ff58-6053-40f7-95cd-99096da7d06e", "8eda15c1-cf69-468e-8baf-59b671c2d725", "91d890d0-5d69-4804-9167-9c4a8b8936b9", "92e2e5aa-9f2d-40a2-97da-387fe1db0346", "9b854309-7c93-4791-948a-a824e5f8c4e9", "a6ee8425-3dd3-40fd-b9bb-214632f04a1a", "ab3f5c63-1c55-4abf-9772-835cfd0174b0", "b65b1177-f376-421b-9097-16d71017de91", "c3b7a3c1-6bcd-4148-91e5-2e3e17f43e8a", "cc0e71c2-3476-4c61-b564-4ca564d84d5e", "cd8cb96a-17e8-4d75-a1fe-c548d75450c9", "dc27eda8-e31f-4388-b9f5-20f8e82c205c", "e05608d2-7f70-47f1-96bd-e7208b026d65", "e0a339ae-bf36-47f3-adab-2da51d0c0605", "e0f7cf42-0bd6-4b55-b947-406fae718290", "e5a2cb68-a00b-43ac-bf5f-b7c03292110d", "f0dd3cdc-8b2d-447f-913c-6dd70e025abb", "f2d01711-75b5-43c3-b298-f66d1cdaf117", "fb3aff59-d7ac-4724-9104-12d43d1a7c6a"], "title": "Engineering big data solutions", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "7c3e70d8-6e13-4a37-b9c2-afad1efd627e"}

The goal of each observer is to compute a state estimate that asymptotically converges to the state of the LTI system. We consider there is a sparsity constraint that restricts interconnections between observers. We provide a sufficient condition for the existence of parameters for the observers which achieve the convergence of the state estimates to the state of the LTI system. In particular, this condition can be written in terms of the eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix of the underlying communication graph and the spectral radius of the dynamic matrix of the LTI system.", "authors": ["Shinkyu Park", "Nuno C.

{"abstract": "Many computer systems solve executable storage size problems for large programs by using overlays. However, it appears that no one overlay scheme contains a well-balanced combination of the most useful capabilities which are found in various existing techniques. A proposal is presented which utilizes several of the best capabilities from existing schemes and is complemented by several additional features, e.g. writable overlays. The writable overlay capability provides a virtual memory effect, although the programmer may still be required to design the overlay configuration. Since overlay structuring is a complex task, several tools (including a graphic display) are included in the proposal in order to aid the programmer in the design. The content of overlays is briefly discussed, and it is noted that many of the details of the final overlay configuration may be decided after the fact.", "authors": ["Thomas R.

{"abstract": "Current development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), e.g., for collision mitigation are increasingly concerned about the protection of other road users. Environment perception provides objects like cars or pedestrians. A prediction of the system vehicle's path is required to decide about the relevance of the objects for a system reaction or to reduce the CAN load in advance. A standard measure for the object criticality is the time-to-collision, where the system vehicle's path is predicted under the assumption of constant acceleration and yaw rate or using lane markings. Lane markings often are not available on urban streets, and the vehicles do not necessarily follow the own lane, e.g., due to parked cars at the road side. This paper proposes an approach that uses maneuver classification based on a combination of the longest-common-subsequence method and a Bayesian classifier. The knowledge obtained about the maneuver in the classification step is used to predict the future trajectory in a parameterizable way. The approach is evaluated in comparison to a prediction with constant acceleration and constant yaw rate using recorded data from more than 20 hours of driving.", "authors": ["Carola Otto", "Fernando Puente Le\u00f3n"], "n_citation": 6, "references": ["11b5a4d6-8c15-4bc4-94e4-ff167e3c7d79", "30e2a9ec-a640-4540-b851-81cca851a435", "3e6dbce2-bed9-4e5f-9a0f-605730908bc8", "5db0ba55-5b56-46aa-a597-b7e897584614", "782d22e4-d8fd-4f77-9322-283fa854f25e", "a05f24a1-20ca-4d6d-b6fb-09b18b954b3e", "c3af7fd1-e136-4123-a551-64fa69be4222", "ce8117f2-5458-4ca1-9f70-89049dcbd906", "e3581932-a9c9-41c0-a1ab-7b8f5ce59c1a"], "title": "Long-term trajectory classification and prediction of commercial vehicles for the application in advanced driver assistance systems", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "7c8f65ff-e9e5-416c-ad54-24ea05645b91"}

{"abstract": "This research work investigates design and robustness analysis of an optimal classifier applied to handwritten Devanagari consonant characters using single hidden layer feed-forward neural network with respect to five fold cross validation. Proposed neural network is trained 3 times by varying PEs in hidden layer from 64 to 128 in steps of 16. For each fold fifteen neural networks are studied.

{"abstract": "Deductive techniques are presented for deriving programs systematically from given specifications. The specifications express the purpose of the desired program without giving any hint of the algorithm to be employed. The desired program is intended to achieve this purpose by means of such low-level primitives as assignment statements, the conditional statements, and recursion. The basic approach is to transform the specifications repeatedly according to certain rules, until a satisfactory program is produced. The rules are guided by a number of strategic controls.   Many of the transformation rules represent knowledge about the program's subject domain (e.g., numbers, lists, sets); some represent the meaning of the constructs of the specification language and the target programming language; and a few rules represent basic programming principles. The  weakest-precondition operator  and the concept of  protection  are employed to construct programs that must achieve more than one condition simultaneously.   Our previous work has centered on the synthesis of  structure-maintaining programs , which produce an output without altering the value of any variable or changing the configuration of any data structure.

{"abstract": "Flexible needles with a bevel tip (steerable needles) promise to enhance targeting accuracy and maneuver inside the human body in order to avoid collision with delicate organs. Contributing image feedback to needle insertion tasks greatly improves such objectives. An important issue in 2D motion planning tasks is stabilizing the needle in a desired plane. Any divergence from the plane leads to the inefficiency of the motion planning scheme. Hence, a control scheme is proposed in this paper which guides the needle to a desired plane. The system of such task is subject to parametric uncertainty. Although the original system is linearly parametrized, the feedback linearized form is not, which prevents the application of conventional adaptive control schemes. Moreover, all state variables of the system could not be measured and a nonlinear observer is necessary to observe the system states. In this paper, the previously proposed adaptive state feedback controller for such systems is modified to an adaptive output feedback controller and the proposed scheme is applied to the problem of needle guidance. Simulation results are presented to illustrate the enhanced performance of the proposed controller methodology as compared to previously proposed feedback linearization scheme.", "authors": ["Mohammad Motaharifar", "Heidar Ali Talebi", "Ahmad Afshar", "Farzaneh Abdollahi"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0561bef8-4791-4e87-b86a-a1cdd8e7429c", "0910c6cf-48b5-4459-8491-da09f3a11b1b", "0b6447ef-9fee-4694-9fb2-c6f1b0d439b3", "208cb1e1-ba3f-4f12-9e85-60e60a4a89df", "26eb4c02-7cd6-4e7c-97bc-00921c153098", "82ee2291-449f-42a6-acf6-d327239703eb", "aa375c6c-656c-4b78-b722-171487178222", "aaa0db23-9025-4c16-815a-aff9fb64b9bc", "c4ed0275-57d8-45cf-8c42-aa79dbdeac2b"], "title": "Adaptive observer-based controller design for a class of nonlinear systems with application to image guided control of steerable needles", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "7cfbb727-766d-48d0-976b-daec938bf07a"}

A PCE should determine the total number of paths downstream and send them to an upstream PCE.

{"abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of Distributed Fault Detection and Isolation (D-FDI) in large networked systems with imprecise models. Taking a previously proposed D-FDI scheme for a given initial network model, we analyze its performance under small changes in the network graph, namely the addition or removal of edges.

The end-order tree algorithm is shown to be an advantageous, immediate replacement for the algorithm in use with current simulation languages.

{"abstract": "We consider a networked control system where a plant is connected to a remote controller via a shared network that allows only one user to transmit at a given time. At each transmission time, the controller decides between sampling one of the plant's sensors or transmitting control data to the plant. We tackle the problem of simultaneously designing a policy for scheduling decisions and a policy for control inputs so as to optimize a quadratic objective. Using the framework of dynamic programming, we propose a rollout strategy by which the scheduling and control decisions are determined at each transmission time as the ones that lead to optimal performance over a given horizon assuming that from then on controller and sensors transmit in a periodic order and the control law is a standard optimal law for periodic systems. We show that this rollout strategy results in a protocol where scheduling decisions are based on the state estimate and error covariance matrix of a Kalman estimator, and must be determined on-line. We contrast the solution to this problem with the solution to the seemingly similar sensor scheduling problem where optimal scheduling decisions can be determined off-line. We highlight how the protocol obtained from the rollout algorithm can be implemented in a distributed way in broadcast networks. Moreover, it follows by construction of rollout algorithms that our proposed scheduling method can outperform any periodic scheduling of transmissions.", "authors": ["Duarte Dj Guerreiro Tom\u00e9 Antunes", "Wpmh Maurice Heemels", "Jo\u00e3o Pedro Hespanha", "Carlos Silvestre"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0ba94957-0c58-458d-9bf6-3b74f5e09f28", "52818e98-b69b-4fa5-9c4c-e6614db6d814", "ddef0427-c805-445e-8a47-e68a30d20308"], "title": "Scheduling measurements and controls over networks \u2014 Part II: Rollout strategies for simultaneous protocol and controller design", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "7d726698-9414-4d7f-ac5c-c3d6dc3a73b1"}

{"abstract": "Introduction    Advances in information technology together with the forces of globalization have accelerated the growth of service industries. In 2003, the OECD reported that service industries now account for over 60% of both employment and the gross domestic product (GDP) of OECD member countries. The U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) has forecast strong employment growth in the American service sector between 2004 and 2014. Although service industries are expanding, Gilmore and Pine argue that, the growing commoditisation of services offered has gradually transformed the competition for market share from focusing on the quality of services to the creation of memorable experiences. As a consequence, the competitive position of a firm now depends to a large extent on its ability to generate impressive experiences through innovative delivery channels.   In this article, we adopt Gilmore and Pine's view that the economic value of the experience economy lies in co-producing the staging experiences via customer participation and connection. Furthermore, we suggest that current technologies and the growth of the Internet have both enabled and strengthened the opportunities for experience-oriented offerings beyond limitations of time and place. In following sections, we first describe the current practice of experience economy in electronic commerce. Taking the iCare health care service as an example, we demonstrate how collaborative pricing over the Internet can further provide added-value to the production of experiences offered in the electronic marketplace.", "authors": ["Wei-Lun Chang", "Soe-Tsyr Yuan", "C.

{"abstract": "The ability to perform long, accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations involving proteins and other biological macro-molecules could in principle provide answers to some of the most important currently outstanding questions in the fields of biology, chemistry, and medicine. A wide range of biologically interesting phenomena, however, occur over timescales on the order of a millisecond---several orders of magnitude beyond the duration of the longest current MD simulations.   We describe a massively parallel machine called Anton, which should be capable of executing millisecond-scale classical MD simulations of such biomolecular systems. The machine, which is scheduled for completion by the end of 2008, is based on 512 identical MD-specific ASICs that interact in a tightly coupled manner using a specialized highspeed communication network. Anton has been designed to use both novel parallel algorithms and special-purpose logic to dramatically accelerate those calculations that dominate the time required for a typical MD simulation. The remainder of the simulation algorithm is executed by a programmable portion of each chip that achieves a substantial degree of parallelism while preserving the flexibility necessary to accommodate anticipated advances in physical models and simulation methods.", "authors": ["David E.

{"abstract": "Self-reconfiguration enables a dynamically adaptive system (DAS) to satisfy requirements even as detrimental system and environmental conditions arise. A DAS, especially one intertwined with physical elements, must increasingly reason about and cope with unpredictable events in its execution environment. Unfortunately, it is often infeasible for a human to exhaustively explore, anticipate, or resolve all possible system and environmental conditions that a DAS will encounter as it executes. While uncertainty can be difficult to define, its effects can hinder the adaptation capabilities of a DAS. The concept of uncertainty has been extensively explored by other scientific disciplines, such as economics, physics, and psychology. As such, the software engineering DAS community can benefit from leveraging, reusing, and refining such knowledge for developing a DAS. By synthesizing uncertainty concepts from other disciplines, this paper revisits the concept of uncertainty from the perspective of a DAS, proposes a taxonomy of potential sources of uncertainty at the requirements, design, and execution phases, and identifies existing techniques for mitigating specific types of uncertainty. This paper also introduces a template for describing different types of uncertainty, including fields such as source, occurrence, impact, and mitigating strategies. We use this template to describe each type of uncertainty and illustrate the uncertainty source in terms of an example DAS application from the intelligent vehicle systems (IVS) domain.", "authors": ["Andres J.

{"abstract": "Atlas is a new software analysis platform from EnSoft Corp. Atlas decouples the domain-specific analysis goal from its underlying mechanism by splitting analysis into two distinct phases. In the first phase, polynomial-time static analyzers index the software AST, building a rich graph database. In the second phase, users can explore the graph directly or run custom analysis scripts written using a convenient API. These features make Atlas ideal for both interaction and automation. In this paper, we describe the motivation, design, and use of Atlas. We present validation case studies, including the verification of safe synchronization of the Linux kernel, and the detection of malware in Android applications.

Objective/Aim : In this paper, we summarize the ongoing discussion on \"Empirical Software Engineering 2.0\" as a way to improve the impact of empirical results on industrial practices. We propose a way to combine data mining and analysis with domain knowledge to enable fast feedback cycles in empirical software engineering research.    Method : We identify the key concepts on gathering fast feedback in empirical software engineering by following an experience-based line of reasoning by argument. Based on the identified key concepts, we design and execute a small proof of concept with a company to demonstrate potential benefits of the approach.

Which fix they choose has many implications, both for practitioners and researchers: What is the risk of introducing other bugs during the fix? Is the bug fix in the same code that caused the bug?

In this paper, we investigate alternative fixes to bugs and present an empirical study of how engineers make design choices about how to fix bugs. Based on qualitative interviews with 40 engineers working on a variety of products, data from 6 bug triage meetings, and a survey filled out by 326 engineers, we found a number of factors, many of them non-technical, that influence how bugs are fixed, such as how close to release the software is.

{"abstract": "Introduction    Users of computer systems are accustomed to being asked for passwords -- it is as universal as it is frustrating. In the past there was little tolerance for the problems experienced remembering passwords, and many users still remember, with embarrassment, having to go hat-in-hand to request a password change and being treated with disdain by a lofty administrator. Latterly there is more understanding of the problems experienced by users, especially since the \" password conundrum \" has reached epidemic proportions for Web users, who are asked for passwords with unrelenting predictability.   The problems with passwords are clear -- users cannot remember numbers of meaningless alphanumeric strings with ease. Hence, they react by choosing simple and predictable words or numbers related to their everyday life, and engaging in insecure practices, such as writing passwords down or sharing them. These practices cause a breach affecting even the most secure and protected network system. Hence the user is often called the weakest link of the security chain, with system administrators despairing of trying to maintain security with the weak link so often reaching breaking point. Users forgetting passwords has serious economical consequences for organizations.   Both academia and industry have been investigating alternatives to passwords, with varying degrees of success. One of the most well-known solutions is the biometric -- measurement of either behavioral or physiological characteristics of the end-user. This is obviously superior to the password because it removes the burden on the user's memory. So why don't we just switch to biometrics and give the poor user a break? There are some valid and hard-to-overcome reasons for the slow uptake of biometrics, but before we can discuss them we need to consider the mechanics of authentication.", "authors": ["Karen Renaud", "Antonella De Angeli"], "n_citation": 42, "references": ["0aa32a76-4d68-47a5-ac9f-312e55e5c1cf", "2e6d7b2c-097f-4958-92d7-2d9194596f7d", "3953bea3-e3f6-4097-8fc0-a941d1a4a606", "41818afe-4eb2-4a83-8a93-3d360dfb4f07", "6b6ec9fc-4534-4725-ab20-52c53acba4bb", "6b9f1a99-d7c1-46b9-8d78-a18f4c4d2f3b", "6fcb5bc5-2ffb-4e07-8948-7ccbc759da61", "8eda006e-ff70-4fbe-a404-86bb3613906e"], "title": "Visual passwords: cure-all or snake-oil?", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2009, "id": "7e26a8c4-6ece-4f9a-991b-0a87987a2447"}

{"abstract": "We have recently proposed a \u201csurplus-based\u201d algorithm which solves the multi-agent average consensus problem on general strongly connected and static digraphs. The essence of that algorithm is to employ an additional variable to keep track of the state changes of each agent, thereby achieving averaging even though the state sum is not preserved. In this paper, we extend this approach to the more challenging case of dynamic digraphs, and consider both deterministic and randomized (of the gossip type) time-varying scenarios. For each scenario, we design an extended surplus-based algorithm and derive a necessary and sufficient graphical condition which guarantees state averaging. In the deterministic time-varying case, the digraphs should be strongly connected in a joint sense; and in the randomized gossip case, the digraphs in the mean should be strongly connected. In particular, these conditions do not impose \u201cbalanced\u201d or \u201csymmetric\u201d requirements on the network topology, and are therefore more general than those previously reported in the literature.", "authors": ["Kai Cai", "Hideaki Ishii"], "n_citation": 20, "references": ["2768199c-b9d6-4001-94d3-e6429c93bc5f", "4a78d773-7703-4de6-9881-2bcef9e336ea", "522ae812-d85e-42c3-8dab-34082fb99e7d", "620e5bc9-d676-4885-9ff4-5151f8355a26", "6460eee0-033e-4185-8b7c-dbcb931e1b2c", "85c4f8fc-fbcd-45f3-b53c-7ebbe980c691", "9dd3e937-4cd1-4353-a2fc-411ebf1f4de5", "cd78243d-c82c-4bab-a678-bdfd002a9a14", "d7b5aadf-ec30-4fb7-9224-7474169d3744"], "title": "Average consensus on arbitrary strongly connected digraphs with dynamic topologies", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "7e62dc5c-d36b-496b-bc80-51e3da633071"}

{"abstract": "This paper presents the design of a position control system for plants that have nonlinear friction. The approach uses nested integral tracking loops: an inner velocity loop and an outer position loop. An additional component of the proposed approach is the nonstandard use of an observer, or reduced-order observer, in the inner loop to estimate the state of the velocity integrator. The designs of the inner loop, outer loop, and observer are accomplished using standard linear pole-placement techniques. The method does not require knowledge of any friction model, yet results in effective friction compensation over a certain bandwidth. The performance of the proposed approach is demonstrated using simulation results as well as hardware experiments with a belt-driven positioning system.", "authors": ["Richard J.

{"abstract": "Effective software engineering demands a coordinated effort. Unfortunately, a comprehensive view on developer coordination is rarely available to support software-engineering decisions, despite the significant implications on software quality, software architecture, and developer productivity. We present a fine-grained, verifiable, and fully automated approach to capture a view on developer coordination, based on commit information and source-code structure, mined from version-control systems. We apply methodology from network analysis and machine learning to identify developer communities automatically. Compared to previous work, our approach is fine-grained, and identifies statistically significant communities using order-statistics and a community-verification technique based on graph conductance. To demonstrate the scalability and generality of our approach, we analyze ten open-source projects with complex and active histories, written in various programming languages. By surveying 53 open-source developers from the ten projects, we validate the authenticity of inferred community structure with respect to reality. Our results indicate that developers of open-source projects form statistically significant community structures and this particular view on collaboration largely coincides with developers' perceptions of real-world collaboration.", "authors": ["Mitchell Joblin", "Wolfgang Mauerer", "Sven Apel", "Janet Siegmund", "Dirk Riehle"], "n_citation": 25, "references": ["0d38b60f-2002-46e9-b726-ccb995eed3fb", "0f3cae96-eb6b-4f7d-b5cc-f0867e001958", "215e1d10-33a8-42ac-b996-d41b03d12a54", "2852fc62-b0b4-4f8e-b118-ab9f2b5210de", "2f082a6f-9356-45f8-b4ff-4409c48ba0ec", "30815526-0779-47a3-9dd4-6a0ea56e0448", "3370037d-1335-4ef3-98e1-90dc8dbc9192", "36cac293-ee33-4c1a-a9c7-0787a7c37bb0", "4cbb46c7-cbaa-4d3b-851c-0720b2324d45", "524a10ae-f761-4478-b163-c8f8695c9550", "601210fa-408e-4c40-9ee9-1b5c7b751e73", "65e77888-f29d-4c35-a932-66028058a206", "68faab18-b537-4f62-85cf-ddc9ef352362", "7201888c-28a5-4d76-b8de-5091b6ec4786", "7320ef81-35bf-4afe-a34f-b179a0bf72f2", "7639cd8a-9cfa-48d8-88c4-bc4bd144ef6d", "79f091ff-0c6d-4658-b664-a4eefbba4c65", "7aac8a21-7c70-48dc-8935-e60c9a6be0e4", "881ffdab-0f89-4a72-8655-8bc3a3fc6577", "89492dcb-ea5d-4dda-a5fb-687818cbe384", "93bc889b-63d5-4032-9c76-33f7bf2c34b3", "a6d2522f-1dfc-4fd4-8f13-bea0fc6ecf05", "b306a192-7333-4f62-a21a-42ffebeb9009", "b56499f0-8d84-4d76-84ea-7be25ae12e07", "cc0e71c2-3476-4c61-b564-4ca564d84d5e", "d2a4a9da-9523-4346-93ed-01d600f61114", "da0971a7-3602-4aac-a53b-2600ac6402a6", "f2f65d68-f4db-4267-982c-bcf85e412b35", "fe81fcfc-f3ec-4f19-bc9c-e0b667b07ed2"], "title": "From developer networks to verified communities: a fine-grained approach", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "7e715738-4d96-4498-83b8-35ee7bbcde76"}

{"abstract": "Two analytic models of a store-and-forward communications network are constructed, one to find the optimal message routing and the other to illustrate the equilibrium (stationary state) maintained by an adaptive routing algorithm. These models show that adaptive routing does not satisfy the necessary conditions for an optimal routing. Adaptive routing tends to overuse the direct path and underuse alternate routes because it does not consider the impact of its current routing decision on the future state of the network. The form of the optimality conditions suggests that a modification of the adaptive algorithm will result in optimality. The modification requires the substitution of a quadratic bias term instead of a linear one in the routing table maintained at each network node. Simulation results are presented which confirm the theoretical analysis for a simple network.", "authors": ["Carson E.

{"abstract": "This paper explores a technique for proving the correctness and termination of programs simultaneously. This approach, which we call the  intermittent-assertion method , involves documenting the program with assertions that must be true at some time when control is passing through the corresponding point, but that need not be true every time. The method, introduced by Knuth and further developed by Burstall, promises to provide a valuable complement to the more conventional methods.   We first introduce and illustrate the technique with a number of examples. We then show that a correctness proof using the invariant assertion method can always be expressed using intermittent assertions instead, but argue that the reverse is not always the case. The method can also be used just to prove termination, and any proof of termination using the conventional well-founded sets approach can be rephrased as a proof using intermittent assertions. Finally, we show how the method can be applied to prove the validity of program transformations and the correctness of continuously operating programs.

{"abstract": "For many companies, including leaders in software development, software is becoming an increasingly critical competitive factor. For example, at Siemens, sixty percent of our business is strongly influenced by software and approximately fifty percent of all Siemens patents are software related. With more than 30,000 software developers worldwide and an expenditure of more than 3 billion Euros, Siemens is playing in the 'Champions League' of the world's leading software companies. But this fact is not well known because most of the software developed at Siemens is embedded. It's embedded in the products and solutions sold to customers, such as medical devices, automation controls, trains, automotive components, and even power plants. Yet a major part of the functionality of these products and solutions is defined by software.Because of the high cost of developing software, and because of its extraordinarily high business impact, optimizing the software development process has become a top priority at Siemens.   Simplifying, standardizing and stabilizing development processes and measuring progress according to the CMMI of the Software Engineering Institute,   Making better use of existing synergy potentials, for example by using cross-divisional software platforms and architectures, and   Reducing costs by making structural changes, such as offshoring software development to low-wage countries and using the skills of different cultures, especially in rapidly-developing Asian markets.  The three levers will be described in detail and examples will be provided. The presentation will emphasize the early phases of software development, particularly with reference to requirements engineering and the importance of functional and non-functional requirements. A simple metrics system to measure success in software development will be presented.

{"abstract": "Model checking techniques for software product lines (SPL) are actively researched. A major limitation they currently have is the inability to deal efficiently with non-Boolean features and multi-features. An example of a non-Boolean feature is a numeric attribute such as maximum number of users which can take different numeric values across the range of SPL products. Multi-features are features that can appear several times in the same product, such as processing units which number is variable from one product to another and which can be configured independently. Both constructs are extensively used in practice but currently not supported by existing SPL model checking techniques. To overcome this limitation, we formally define a language that integrates these constructs with SPL behavioural specifications. We generalize SPL model checking algorithms correspondingly and evaluate their applicability. Our results show that the algorithms remain efficient despite the generalization.", "authors": ["Maxime Cordy", "Pierre-Yves Schobbens", "Patrick Heymans", "Axel Legay"], "n_citation": 58, "references": ["0278bce3-e509-4ae6-b130-87a283a4b819", "2bbe5f5c-aec9-428b-b3d1-d10934bab726", "36182b33-10d7-4c2d-8d57-2689f11991f3", "3b29bf8f-a515-4fb5-85ae-a46faab20c5a", "49bb7b2d-32a0-4335-a3b6-9d606685cd7f", "51dc0300-ad75-43cf-8918-43d69f45bc6f", "64fec467-4e81-4bf1-801d-1cd9a7b07744", "66573306-8d9a-4835-957c-90c831a9487b", "6c80a854-3cc1-47b3-bc58-b6434fba8649", "7294bf9c-3835-4e22-8b39-ec983c56ec2e", "737de1cf-5cf6-4496-87da-3523f4228eba", "81541435-ee9c-4e08-a47c-76e93e1697d0", "83cb0010-b854-4ca5-85c6-5e8619a1d4c9", "88224cef-f2cb-4f04-a2ce-3d8489733b3e", "a6af6a2a-7087-4dd3-aa37-94722a3313e6", "ca392089-1214-436e-bda5-1760e6af2226", "cc2dece9-5e35-495c-b5c4-7581d006ba02", "d2e955f4-754c-437a-938b-b6a5a005da0f", "f08cbffa-9467-4c74-a284-7db15837ac53", "f0fca1f9-e042-4c03-900f-0287c7dfe81f", "f1eecad9-9c5a-4e38-bbab-36657885c8ca", "fbab723e-0028-4406-a3a4-dcf27dd6554e"], "title": "Beyond boolean product-line model checking: dealing with feature attributes and multi-features", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "7f5327c7-4e03-426e-8339-24c8ed9068fd"}

The agents can be viewed as nodes in a graph and the relative measurements between agents as the graph's edges.

A DC motor-generator applies a positive or negative torque to the knee. The control system regulates the exchange of energy between the motor-generator and a supercapacitor. The central idea of the design is motivated by the mechanics, energy management, and sensor- based control that constitute human movement. We use biogeography-based optimization, which is an evolutionary algorithm, to optimize the system parameters, and we evaluate its performance with Simulink \u00ae models. We optimize three alternative prosthesis designs. Simulation results indicate that the prosthesis can be optimized to achieve knee angle tracking with an RMS error on the order of 0.2 degrees. I.

{"abstract": "Programmers need software documentation. However, documentation is expensive to produce and maintain, and often becomes outdated over time. Programmers often lack the time and resources to write documentation. Therefore, automated solutions are desirable.

I propose three specific research objectives to improving automatic documentation generation. I propose to study the similarity between source code and summary. Second, I propose studying whether or not including contextual information about source code improves summary quality.

{"abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has been applied to a wide range of motion control problems in robotics. In particular, policy gradient method (PGM) emerges as a powerful subset of RL that can learn effectively from one's experience. However, when the dynamics is stochastic and is short of samples for learning, the performance of PGM becomes inconsistent and heavily relies on the tweaking of the learning rate. In this work, we argue that this degeneration is mainly due to the high variance in the gradient. Through theoretical justifications, simulations and experiments, we verify that by applying a variance suppression, which is called local baseline, on the gradient, PGM can then be applied to some previously untouchable problems.", "authors": ["Tak Kit Lau", "Yun-Hui Liu"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["01e56f6a-9c64-4552-97ff-4237a90f5331", "0de9742f-53d2-429c-9d24-3ef703575ee7", "10faea31-cb77-4a47-8ec5-42f51c56c284", "2bb2337b-4056-41ee-a679-5b614a5c0043", "5275854d-43fd-4f9f-a741-d61b590a2bda", "692d17a3-eff8-460b-b2cb-2ce705955f78", "c65b38aa-bc41-4708-8236-695ceb207765", "e6a77cde-d33f-47c7-9717-dec0afbaff8c", "f233c96b-73ff-44fc-9b0f-d697b4aec248"], "title": "The importance of variance reduction in policy gradient method", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "7f7e26b4-d4b6-4e39-80f2-5661943fc357"}

{"abstract": "The input/output dynamic behavior of a biomolec-ular system is affected by interconnection to other downstream systems through impedance-like effects called retroactivity. In this paper, we study the effects of retroactivity at the interconnection between two transcriptional modules, focusing on stochastic behavior. In particular, we describe the system through the Master equation and develop a singular perturbation theory to obtain a reduced Master equation. We prove that the solution of the original Master equation converges fast to an e neighbor of the solution of the reduced Master equation, in which e is the singular perturbation parameter. Our analysis shows that the upstream system and the downstream one are statistically independent at the steady state. However, the interconnection slows down the dynamics of both the expectation and the variance of the output of the upstream transcriptional module.", "authors": ["Reza Ghaemi", "Domitilla Del Vecchio"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["aafcaaf7-c846-49ec-82ec-e40e784bd908"], "title": "Stochastic analysis of retroactivity in transcriptional networks through singular perturbation", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "7f91eb18-b27a-4483-8106-ffaaa6211806"}
{"abstract": "The use of curves to represent two-dimensional structures is an important part of many scientific investigations. For example, geographers use curves extensively to represent map features such as contour lines, roads, and rivers. Circuit layout designers use curves to specify the wiring between circuits. Because of the very large amount of data involved and the need to perform operations on this data efficiently, the representation of such curves is a crucial issue. A hierarchical representation consisting of binary trees with a special datum at each node is described. This datum is called a strip and the tree that contains such data is called a strip tree. Lower levels in the tree correspond to finer resolution representations of the curve. The strip tree structure is a direct consequence of using a special method for digitizing lines and retaining all intermediate steps. This gives several desirable properties. For curves that are well-behaved, intersection and point-membership (for closed curves) calculations can be solved in 0(log  n ) where  n  is the number of points describing the curve. The curves can be efficiently encoded and displayed at various resolutions. The representation is closed under intersection and union and these operations can be carried out at different resolutions. All these properties depend on the hierarchical tree structure which allows primitive operations to be performed at the lowest possible resolution with great computational time savings.  Strip trees is a linear interpolation scheme which realizes an important space savings by not representing all the points explicitly. This means that even when the overhead of the tree indexing is added, the storage requirement is comparable to raster representations which do represent most of the points explicitly.", "authors": ["Dana H.

{"abstract": "Aggregation is introduced as an abstraction which is important in conceptualizing the real world. Aggregation transforms a relationship between objects into a higher-level object. A new data type, called aggregate, is developed which, under certain criteria of \u201cwell-definedness,\u201d specifies aggregation abstractions. Relational databases defined as collections of aggregates are structured as a hierarchy of n-ary relations. To maintain well-definedness, update operations on such databases must preserve two invariants. Well-defined relations are distinct from relations in third normal form. It is shown that these notions are complementary and both are important in database design. A top-down methodology for database design is described which separates decisions concerning aggregate structure from decisions concerning key identification. It is suggested that aggregate types, and other types which support real-world abstractions without introducing implementation detail, should be incorporated into programming languages.", "authors": ["John Miles Smith", "Diane C.

{"abstract": "In this paper, a o\u00a8 novel strategy for a class of system identification problems is proposed. Similar to adaptive learning methods, the new algorithm is also built on a linearly parameterized model where system output is expressed as a linear combination of signals generated from measurements and system inputs. In contrast to existing methodology, the new method employs a set of functionals of the regressors instead of the regressors themselves to estimate the unknown parameters. The new adaptive learning algorithm is also applied to the state feedback and the output feedback of a standard Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC) structure. Stability and convergence properties of the new algorithm are studied in the this paper. Simulation results show that the new method exhibits a fast rate of convergence and the ability to converge even when the systems are not persistently excited. In addition, it is observed qualitatively in the simulations that the chattering effect in the system response and the control signal are suppressed in comparison to simulations using other conventional adaptive methods.", "authors": ["Yu Lei", "Andrew J.

{"abstract": "Affix grammars are two-level grammars which are similar to van Wijngaarden's two-level grammars used in the definition of Algol 68. Affix grammars are shown by Koster to be equal in power to van Wijngaarden grammars. They are much more suited to parsing than are the latter, however. Koster, the inventor of affix grammars, suggests a top-down scheme for parsing them, based on recursive procedures. This paper presents a bottom-up scheme for parsing them, based on an extension of Floyd Production Language (FPL). Included is an algorithm, similar to that of DeRemer's, for converting a large class of affix grammars into FPL. The paper concludes by discussing briefly the applicabilities of the conversion algorithm and affix grammars in general, and some possible extensions to Koster's definition of affix grammars.", "authors": ["David R.

{"abstract": "Control designs to facilitate increased utilization of wind powered electric generation face challenges from two directions. From the \u201csystem\u201d perspective of the grid, increased wind penetration carries responsibility for greater participation in grid frequency regulation, a function historically provided by traditional synchronous generators. From the \u201ccomponent\u201d perspective of the individual turbine, requirements for long mechanical life and low maintenance translate to a need for control imposing low stress on the drivetrain/gearbox. Recent literature has tended to treat these two separately, while the work here proposes and analyzes a distributed control design that jointly addresses both. To achieve the required flexibility, available actuation is assumed to be augmented by modest amounts of controllable power from battery storage, along with industry-standard power controls at the wind turbines themselves (i.e., the new control design focus is on the batteries, to supplement standard, existing controls on wind turbines). Novel features of the methodology include: (i) adoption of an \u201cexosystem\u201d state model representing wind speed disturbances; (ii) assurance that actuators remain within saturation limits for modeled disturbances (e.g., batteries within their maximum power capability); (iii) use of a modest number of phasor unit measurements at the distributed controllers to enhance observability in relevant modal subspaces.", "authors": ["Chaitanya A.

{"abstract": "Developing software is a complex, intrinsically intellectual, and therefore ephemeral activity, also due to the intangible nature of the end product, the source code. There is a thin red line between a productive development session, where a developer actually  does  something useful and productive, and a session where the developer essentially produces \"fried air\", pieces of code whose quality and usefulness are doubtful at best. We believe that well-thought mechanisms of gamification built on fine-grained interaction information mined from the IDE can crystallize and reward good coding behavior.   We present our preliminary experience with the design and implementation of a micro-gamification layer built into an object-oriented IDE, which at the end of each development session not only helps the developer to understand what he actually produced, but also praises him in case the development session was productive. Building on this, we envision an environment where the IDE reflects on the deeds of the developers and by providing a historical view also helps to track and reward long-term growth in terms of development skills, not dissimilar from the mechanics of role-playing games.", "authors": ["Roberto Minelli", "Andrea Mocci", "Michele Lanza"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["2fec0e43-2505-4054-91d8-10d65c0ded8f", "360a0c61-7f49-437d-98b5-66bc1e7e054b", "4456fae7-43d0-4426-bd36-6d962d7678c1", "662d8ae5-a35c-424c-8eab-092b1738a1c2", "90b2d362-c6c6-490b-8be2-b8b7384c9fe5", "a19edcdb-9da8-4f5d-8d6f-df86119cd2b0"], "title": "Free hugs: praising developers for their actions", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "801c5151-23b8-4fdc-90f5-6405690b936a"}

{"abstract": "Opportunistic networks (OppNets) are an interesting topic that are seen to have a promising future. Many protocols have been developed to accommodate the features of OppNets such as frequent partitions, long delays, and no end-to-end path between the source and destination nodes. Embedding security into these protocols is challenging and has taken a lot of attention in research. One of the attacks that OppNets are exposed to is the packet dropping attack, where the malicious node attempts to drop some packets and forwards an incomplete number of packets which results in the distortion of the message. To increase the security levels in OppNets, this paper presents an algorithm developed to detect packet dropping attacks, and finds the malicious node that attempted the attack. The algorithm detects the attack by using an indicative field in the header section of each packet; the indicative field has 3 sub fields - the identification field, the flag field, and the offset field. These 3 fields are used to find if a node receives the complete original number of packets from the previous node.

In decomposing numbers from the right on a CDC 6000 in particular, special techniques are possible [2].

Research has demonstrated that such deadlocks can be predicted through static analysis.

The current work combines both approaches: conducting static analysis to predict possible deadlocks and provide their corresponding fingerprints to Dimmunix. These fingerprints forewarn Dimmunix of all deadlock possibilities rather than it learn about them one at a time. For our experiments we use 8 deadlock programs that were developed based upon deadlock predictions from static analysis of the entire JRE by a tool called Stalemate.

Two other pairs of estimators are shown to be biased. Expressions for the transient-free statistics are obtained in terms of interval statistics.

{"abstract": "In an integrated development environment, the ability to manage the evolution of a software system in terms of logical abstractions, compositions, and their interrelations is crucial to successful software development. This paper presents a novel framework and infrastructure,  Molhado , upon which to build  object-oriented  software configuration management (SCM) services in a SCM-centered integrated development environment. Key contributions of this paper include a  product versioning  model, an  extensible, logical,  and  object-oriented system model , and a  reusable product versioning SCM infrastructure , that allow new types of objects to be implemented as extensions of the system model's basic entities. Versions and configurations of objects are managed at different levels of abstraction and granularity.

{"abstract": "To fulfill the increasing demand of business for the latest information, current data integration approaches are moving towards real-time updates. In the case of real-time data integration the updates occurring on the source systems need to be reflected in the data warehouse immediately. One important element in real-time data integration is the join of a continuous incoming data stream with a disk-based master data. In this context a stream-based algorithm called X-HYBRIDJOIN (Extended Hybrid Join) has been proposed earlier, with a favorable asymptotic runtime behavior. However, the absolute performance was not as good as hoped for. In this paper we present results showing that through properly tuning the algorithm, the resulting Tuned X-HYBRIDJOIN performs significantly better than that of the previous X-HYBRIDJOIN, and better as other applicable join operators found in literature. We present the tuning approach, based on measurement techniques and a revised cost model. To evaluate the algorithm's performance we conduct an experimental study that shows that Tuned X-HYBRIDJOIN exhibits the desired performance characteristics.", "authors": ["M.

{"abstract": "Air-turbine dental handpieces (ATDH) are used in most of dental practices as the main cutting tool. However, the speed of these handpieces is reduced while cutting a tooth; because no speed controller has been provided for them. This speed-reduction decreases the cutting efficiency of air-turbine handpieces. A review of literature indicated no study concerned with designing a speed controller for ATDH. Thus, in this paper, a control scheme is proposed for regulating the speed including \u2018measurement\u2019, \u2018actuation\u2019, and \u2018controller-design\u2019 stages. An accelerometer was employed to capture vibrations of the handpiece; and the frequency associated with the first peak in the spectrum was indicated to represent the speed. An on/off solenoid valve with pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique was employed to regulate the speed through controlling the input pressure to the handpiece. Changing the duty-cycle of the PWM pulses could vary the speed. A process model from the applied duty-cycle to the measured speed was obtained. This process model includes a linear dynamic and a nonlinear static part. Then, a proportional-integral- (PI) controller was selected, and the gains were tuned. The practicality and efficiency of the proposed control scheme with the PI controller was confirmed by experimental results.", "authors": ["Vahid Zakeri", "Siamak Arzanpour"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["e7651b57-aa26-47b5-bbc0-be23538f487a"], "title": "A speed regulating scheme for air-turbine dental handpieces", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "80cee7e3-11cb-4370-b228-3f5923af79da"}
{"abstract": "Over the last 15 years the increased availability of computers and the introduction of the RSA cryptosystem has led to a number of new and remarkable algorithms for finding the prime factors of large integers. Factoring numbers is an arithmetic problem so simple to understand that school children are asked to do it. While multiplying or adding two very large numbers is simple and can be done quite quickly, the age-old problem of trying to find a number that divides another number still has no simple solution. Computer science has reached a point where it is starting to custom tailor the design of computers toward solving specific problems. This pracnique will discuss some of the more recent algorithms for factoring large numbers and how networks of computers can be used to run these algorithms quickly.

The approach utilizes an attitude parametrization based on quaternions and consists of the following two stages. First an input-output linearization from the z position to the thrust is performed, followed by a second input-output linearization from the xy position to the control torques. This separation leads to a so called quasi-static feedback linearization that omits additional controller states. Since the translational dynamics depend only on the orientation of the thrust vector, the required attitude information can be described by only two degrees of freedom. This enables a model of reduced order for the translational dynamics which is decoupled from the yaw dynamics.

{"abstract": "Contracts are a popular tool for specifying the functional behavior of software. This paper characterizes the contracts that developers write, the contracts that developers could write, and how a developer reacts when shown the difference.     This paper makes three research contributions based on an investigation of open-source projects' use of Code Contracts. First, we characterize Code Contract usage in practice. For example, approximately three-fourths of the Code Contracts are basic checks for the presence of data. We discuss similarities and differences in usage across the projects, and we identify annotation burden, tool support, and training as possible explanations based on developer interviews. Second, based on contracts automatically inferred for four of the projects, we find that developers underutilize contracts for expressing state updates, object state indicators, and conditional properties. Third, we performed user studies to learn how developers decide which contracts to enforce. The developers used contract suggestions to support their existing use cases with more expressive contracts. However, the suggestions did not lead them to experiment with other use cases for which contracts are better-suited.     In support of the research contributions, the paper presents two engineering contributions: (1) Celeriac, a tool for generating traces of .NET programs compatible with the Daikon invariant detection tool, and (2) Contract Inserter, a Visual Studio add-in for discovering and inserting likely invariants as Code Contracts.", "authors": ["Todd W.

{"abstract": "Development of software-intensive products and services increasingly occurs by continuously deploying product or service increments, such as new features and enhancements, to customers. Product and service developers need to continuously find out what customers want by direct customer feedback and observation of usage behaviour, rather than indirectly through up-front business analyses. This paper examines the preconditions for setting up an experimentation system for continuous customer experiments. It describes the building blocks required for such a system. An initial model for continuous experimentation is analytically derived from prior work. The model is then matched against empirical case study findings from a startup company and adjusted. Building blocks for a continuous experimentation system and infrastructure are presented. A suitable experimentation system requires at least the ability to release minimum viable products or features with suitable instrumentation, design and manage experiment plans, link experiment results with a product roadmap, and manage a flexible business strategy. The main challenges are proper and rapid design of experiments, advanced instrumentation of software to collect, analyse, and store relevant data, and the integration of experiment results in both the product development cycle and the software development process.", "authors": ["Fabian Fagerholm", "Alejandro Sanchez Guinea", "Hanna M\u00e4enp\u00e4\u00e4", "J\u00fcrgen M\u00fcnch"], "n_citation": 60, "references": ["1c127262-accf-4e10-8400-1fb544f5bd6f", "1d568e5d-aa96-42a7-b346-88bfa88a7a84", "1ef6ec6f-cbbb-4126-9530-422c879095a6", "40470faf-b6d9-412a-80dd-2bd294e8f650", "45075947-5fb7-4b50-8f66-903f907a957c", "709884a8-615c-4283-aedf-3c3849f0ac71", "73591095-a76d-4862-94cb-24d4543c4a25", "885cfaf9-43e5-4101-9554-40962d09fe53", "91e5d897-0237-49d0-bfc4-8d25cb3d080c", "a50e0e7a-2de4-4167-a6b0-739936b98a09", "e23ec27f-13b0-4db0-afdb-d7cf05a96dd1", "f4593e9d-babb-43c6-ab3f-465df23afb55", "f55ba15e-33c9-463e-b403-100a8dd0a476", "f93e598d-0940-4fc7-ab46-9847e75445f8"], "title": "Building blocks for continuous experimentation", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "81759297-02bb-420e-b3be-9b7782a6d8db"}

{"abstract": "Crowdsourcing has had extraordinary success in solving a diverse set of problems, ranging from digitization of libraries and translation of the Internet, to scientific challenges such as classifying elements in the galaxy or determining the 3D shape of an enzyme. By leveraging the power of the masses, it is feasible to complete tasks in mere days and sometimes even hours, and to take on tasks that were previously impossible because of their sheer scale. Underlying the success of crowdsourcing is a common theme --- the microtask. By breaking down the overall task at hand into microtasks providing short, self-contained pieces of work, work can be performed independently, quickly, and in parallel --- enabling numerous and often untrained participants to chip in. This paper puts forth a research agenda, examining the question of whether the same kinds of successes that microtask crowdsourcing is having in revolutionizing other domains can be brought to software development. That is, we ask whether it is possible to push well beyond the open source paradigm, which still relies on traditional, coarse-grained tasks, to a model in which programming proceeds through microtasks performed by vast numbers of crowd developers.", "authors": ["Thomas D.

{"abstract": "Common wisdom in the automated data structure generation community states that declarative techniques have better usability than imperative techniques, while imperative techniques have better performance. We show that this reasoning is fundamentally flawed: if we go to the declarative limit and employ constraint logic programming (CLP), the CLP data structure generation has orders of magnitude better performance than comparable imperative techniques. Conversely, we observe and argue that when it comes to realistically complex data structures and properties, the CLP specifications become more obscure, indirect, and difficult to implement and understand than their imperative counterparts.

Our contribution here is to make explicit, and to question, certain assumptions that underlie current digital library efforts. We will argue that current efforts are limited by a largely unexamined and unintended allegiance to an idealized view of what libraries have been, rather than what they actually are or could be. Since these limits come from current ways of thinking about the problem, rather than being inherent in the technology or in social practice, expanding our conception of digital libraries should serve to expand the scope and the utility of development efforts.", "authors": ["David M.

{"abstract": "Introduction    Outsourcing as a means of meeting organizational information technology (IT) needs is a commonly accepted and growing practice; one that is continually evolving to include a much wider set of business functions: logistics, accounting, human resources, legal, and risk assessment. 3  Today firms of all sizes are rushing overseas to have their IT work performed by offshore vendors. Such change---the pundits argue---is merely the natural progression of first moving blue-collar work overseas followed by whitecollar work. IT jobs are most visible to us in the IT field, but the same is happening to other business functions/processes. With labor costs in India well below the U.S. and technical skills equal or better, the argument for offshoring is compelling. (Offshoring refers to the migration of all or a significant part of the development, maintenance and delivery of IT services to a vendor located in another country, typically in the developing world like India and China. The service provider hires, trains and manages the personnel. Alternatively, an organization might set up IT operations offshore but still controlled by the organization's management 2 ). Here, I seek to analyze some of the arguments underlying the notion of offshoring and implications for the IT field from a U.S. perspective. While I am aware that such an undertaking is unquestionably a thorny proposition, I feel that too little 'serious' thought has been given to this issue. Currently, we are plagued by hype (both positive and negative) but little critical reflection. Hopefully, this paper can begin to reverse this trend and shed light on the challenges we face.", "authors": ["Rudy Hirschheim"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["3ddf8245-810b-4404-881d-921589dd4e42"], "title": "Offshoring and the new world order", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2009, "id": "82321112-af1c-4b43-a751-ac88654ad236"}

{"abstract": "This paper examines the value of storage in securing reliability of a system with uncertain supply and demand, and supply friction. The storage is frictionless as a supply source, but it cannot be filled up instantaneously. The focus is on application to an energy network in which the nominal supply and demand are assumed to match perfectly, while deviations from the nominal values are modeled as random shocks with stochastic arrivals. Due to friction, the random shocks cannot be tracked by the main supply sources. Storage, when available, can be used to compensate, fully or partially, for the surge in demand or sudden drop in supply. The problem of optimal utilization of storage with the objective of maximizing system reliability is formulated as minimization of the expected discounted cost of blackouts over an infinite horizon. It is shown that when the stage cost is linear in the size of the blackout, the optimal policy is myopic in the sense that all shocks will be compensated by storage up to the available level of storage. However, when the stage cost is strictly convex, it may be optimal to curtail some of the demand and allow a small blackout in the interest of maintaining a higher level of reserve, which may help avoid a large blackout in the future. The value of storage capacity in improving reliability, as well as the effects of the associated optimal policies under different stage costs on the probability distribution of blackouts are examined.", "authors": ["Ali ParandehGheibi", "Mardavij Roozbehani", "Asuman E.

{"abstract": "The onward sweep of automatic processing of information is impeded by nine principal barriers: geography, cost, problem complexity, man-machine communication, inadequate sensors, lack of understanding, distance, time, and size. The main incentive for breaching these barriers is the universal need for processing information, ever more urgent as the greater part of human work activity changes from production to service.  Computer developments in hardware, programming, time-sharing, education, data communication, and displays are judged by how effectively they remove these barriers, and their barrier-smashing potentialities indicate continued rapid expansion. Problem-oriented languages are particularly effective over the entire front. Online computers and time-sharing also rate high by this measure. Education and increased understanding are basic to all progress with the computer.  This complex but powerful tool is the most important one available to  governments and scientists to use in studying the problems being created by the population explosion, and in analyzing possible solutions.", "authors": ["E.

{"abstract": "Crowdsourcing is an emerging and promising approach which involves delegating a variety of tasks to an unknown workforce - the crowd. Crowdsourcing has been applied quite successfully in various contexts from basic tasks on Amazon Mechanical Turk to solving complex industry problems, e.g. InnoCentive. Companies are increasingly using crowdsourcing to accomplish specific software development tasks. However, very little research exists on this specific topic. This paper presents an in-depth industry case study of crowdsourcing software development at a multinational corporation. Our case study highlights a number of challenges that arise when crowdsourcing software development. For example, the crowdsourcing development process is essentially a waterfall model and this must eventually be integrated with the agile approach used by the company. Crowdsourcing works better for specific software development tasks that are less complex and stand-alone without interdependencies. The development cost was much greater than originally expected, overhead in terms of company effort to prepare specifications and answer crowdsourcing community queries was much greater, and the time-scale to complete contests, review submissions and resolve quality issues was significant. Finally, quality issues were pushed later in the lifecycle given the lengthy process necessary to identify and resolve quality issues. Given the emphasis in software engineering on identifying bugs as early as possible, this is quite problematic.", "authors": ["Klaas-Jan Stol", "Brian Fitzgerald"], "n_citation": 65, "references": ["003136a2-6a65-40dd-a037-83b6538a6f8c", "0d3fd55f-36ca-4788-b7a6-92229a7d912d", "161bbc1b-bee5-494e-8f3e-4770bd66207d", "18bd355f-8b04-4afe-9240-82a99690ed35", "19895072-d2ec-404d-b561-415f5fed0d3b", "1dff0894-ca58-42de-bad8-955da57632d3", "1e7c551c-ea7b-4944-bae8-cad324455621", "1f28f42e-6b6d-497e-b967-2de4877f52f5", "23381899-4eef-4064-b721-895ea71616cf", "243029ab-87d6-4137-9970-ec09d444fd50", "24f8027e-6b52-4dc8-944d-0dba98267372", "2a0d5376-b235-49ee-afad-aa1112cd71fc", "2f120771-00bb-4350-8b47-5baa3ffa03ed", "37c854ab-691c-4416-aa0b-58b136014d45", "4034d553-8d7e-4426-a7db-86c104b02138", "4c2ecd7f-60eb-4c94-a2d7-767b637749b9", "521c30a1-a18e-42aa-b672-92d67098307e", "541641ab-a9d8-4aa8-ac1c-29d1bb1057a3", "54d9944f-3224-433e-bb14-661b0a39a0aa", "5fe65112-16a5-436e-a072-0f03a77d7a54", "60bb5575-5fcc-462e-87da-80c07b385692", "6ef2b150-1723-47cb-bff1-6ceafa71c755", "733c5450-3f32-4fb1-a327-ce0d122d0dcf", "7e778f51-edb8-4e10-8d87-f7993a531d95", "87c5a473-60a5-483e-a89e-cea551a22b6f", "92ced7c1-11a4-4898-8005-69564881c2e9", "952d0920-71f0-489e-93ea-452e2aa3e150", "9702e696-65e3-4057-b12b-ea159fabbf9e", "9748db53-c534-4e6e-b3ac-27d43b1a960c", "9c190f3b-ef74-4d05-a85a-cfaf4db6ada2", "9dfd418e-173e-4b47-a61a-55b507f0d952", "9e0067c4-9c83-44cc-9a5d-2d231702eac1", "a7d2ec63-588f-462e-a202-dc53e465a38e", "a931cd63-c360-423a-9888-ebe093b5ab61", "b866a8a8-4b7d-4737-a4c5-edf995d9fbf0", "b94df36a-8c4f-4d85-a920-3c4968f86fc0", "ba984295-5334-4fd1-8489-65abd5d9d2ea", "bbd513a6-4924-453c-8f69-57aacf5c683a", "bd689d21-09f8-4923-8da2-608b524d37d0", "c3b7a3c1-6bcd-4148-91e5-2e3e17f43e8a", "d3753361-af9a-41d8-b890-92678df73288", "d3aa2e19-71d1-43e9-8c42-eef8b281ca84", "dd4580ea-c007-487e-bc5e-0c5d500e7315", "e61f77a0-80bf-4cc9-995d-f4f8b6f11f92", "e6408ba0-3339-4bfb-82a9-5fd9dd39e839", "ea0c91f1-ce4b-45ae-939b-85ccc3f9acab", "f0055425-1f0a-49e3-b69b-fef9cce3c525", "f4325b1c-f31a-4369-b2e4-0487807e2ce0", "f6f6b459-5b2b-45a4-8057-b07320972ebc", "fc1e93bf-8fac-4bea-916c-20a011248767", "feb4ddca-de0f-4c73-a8da-c409ca377a0c", "fee1cfc2-f5ce-4b7c-9895-24c8efc9edc0", "ff5847a0-60a3-4968-984d-2db0b2eac791"], "title": "Two's company, three's a crowd: a case study of crowdsourcing software development", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "826dcc00-1f9f-4ff5-b7f6-78607d418a39"}

{"abstract": "The typical situation in software developing organizations can be characterized by two extremes: in some organizations or organizational units, software development processes are partly defined, whereas in organizations or organizational units where the processses are well defined, these processes are usually only valid at the project start. For design of a process that is able to fulfil the requirements, the author proposes an emergent process design (EPD) approach. The EPD approach guides the extraction and the adaptation of a project-specific process. This is done as follows. Initially, the project-specific process frame is extracted by tailoring one of the process variants provided in a process line. The first development is based on the tailored process frame. For further development iterations or projects that are to utilize this frame, the frame is adapted and refined to the project-specific process based on the logs of the performed tasks in the previous process iteration. In order to insure the desired quality of the final product, the project-specific process becomes more stringent over the course of the project.", "authors": ["Olga Jaufman"], "n_citation": 0, "references": [], "title": "Emergent process design", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2005, "id": "82cbabba-c78d-4b69-91f4-a6afa4683d09"}

{"abstract": "Modern computer systems are inherently nondeterministic due to a variety of events that occur during an execution, including I/O, interrupts, and DMA fills. The lack of repeatability that arises from this nondeterminism can make it difficult to develop and maintain correct software. Furthermore, it is likely that the impact of nondeterminism will only increase in the coming years, as commodity systems are now shared-memory multiprocessors. Such systems are not only impacted by the sources of nondeterminism in uniprocessors, but also by the outcome of memory races among concurrent threads.   In an effort to help ease the pain of developing software in a nondeterministic environment, researchers have proposed adding  deterministic replay  capabilities to computer systems. A system with a deterministic replay capability can record sufficient information during an execution to enable a replayer to (later) create an equivalent execution despite the inherent sources of nondeterminism that exist. With the ability to replay an execution verbatim, many new applications may be possible:    Debugging:  Deterministic replay could be used to provide the illusion of a  time-travel debugger  that has the ability to selectively execute both forward and backward in time.    Security:  Deterministic replay could also be used to enhance the security of software by providing the means for an in-depth analysis of an attack, hopefully leading to rapid patch deployment and a reduction in the economic impact of new threats.    Fault Tolerance:  With the ability to replay an execution, it may also be possible to develop hot-standby systems for critical service providers using commodity hardware. A virtual machine (VM) could, for example, be fed, in real time, the replay log of a primary server running on a physically separate machine. The standby VM could use the replay log to mimic the primary's execution, so that in the event that the primary fails, the backup can take over operation with almost zero downtime.", "authors": ["Derek R.

{"abstract": "The basic ideas of nondeterministic programming are critically reconsidered to single out a proper attitude and programming style for languages allowing direct control of nondeterministic features. The proposed attitude aims at retaining the purity of the nondeterministic formulation of search processes on one level (the  attempt  level), deferring the coordination of problem solving efforts to another (the  choice  level). The feasibility of recognizing these two levels is discussed, stressing that the structure to be managed at the choice level is a tree of contexts. The leaves are computational environments, each holding an alternative under inspection, while the other nodes are associated with choice points. According to the proposed programming style, a  generative function  is associated with each choice point, which expresses the desired choice strategy. The main advantage of this approach is the localization of the search strategies: Each nonterminal node of the tree keeps track of the state of the computation as it was when the choice point was last interrogated, holding at the same time the strategy to coordinate the available alternatives.

{"abstract": "Concurrent programs proliferate as multi-core technologies advance. The regression testing of concurrent programs often requires running a failing test for weeks before catching a faulty interleaving, due to the myriad of possible interleavings of memory accesses arising from concurrent program executions. As a result, the conventional approach that selects a sub-set of test cases for regression testing without considering interleavings is insufficient In this paper we present R e C on T est  to address the problem by selecting the new interleavings that arise due to code changes. These interleavings must be explored in order to uncover regression bugs. R e C on T est  efficiently selects new interleavings by first identifying shared memory accesses that are affected by the changes, and then exploring only those problematic interleavings that contain at least one of these accesses. We have implemented R e C on T est  as an automated tool and evaluated it using 13 real-world concurrent program subjects. Our results show that R e C on T est  can significantly reduce the regression testing cost without missing any faulty interleavings induced by code changes.", "authors": ["Valerio Terragni", "Shing Chi Cheung", "Charles Chuan Zhang"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["049aed6a-456d-4c19-aa00-e994dd18051c", "119162d6-0403-4980-8096-f6fa5d9fc228", "11b47a34-e765-4ba7-ad20-2be49b46e7fe", "1298c411-c80b-4510-b27c-9732bb1c1843", "136c4780-2f25-4068-90a5-aed6afaf2890", "16df46c4-e0b5-4809-a2cf-6571e98facca", "18ecef28-8978-4639-bc43-8e81064535a0", "198e0bba-d97a-4a85-a9a6-2d8ae4c7bb06", "1b1fd253-0723-4b10-be49-2560b74f0c7b", "1b54cd30-2ede-4d46-b224-53b33579e774", "1d1830c9-3800-477e-aa48-75c1aef6366b", "1d32af55-c049-4537-a5e6-56818c16c83c", "1ed7595f-48b7-4395-8d5b-12d94cb74ae5", "22d752e8-37f8-4d04-a952-442273436874", "230029dc-2417-4d40-98a4-bd0698f7c5f1", "26e76d44-fedc-42de-a1bd-523c3a45acd5", "28225458-58c1-4b5f-896e-02227f596430", "34c637dd-78b0-4b6e-9cd8-1defb114ba20", "34ceb3fb-197b-4c68-ab72-9de587254bae", "366eb599-a733-41b6-81ac-e0255ae6eae1", "3d50af37-6175-4608-bd89-2dcc4de2b16a", "4fc5dfcc-f896-4fbc-b3b8-0a5636213d88", "511eaf8e-45ce-40ca-9060-090a8eef1cc6", "55b99435-4dbe-4add-8f40-9278ec542a68", "62e24d3f-a586-4ef3-b4aa-54f093bb7ec3", "64e34383-e54b-4a18-9a99-b0e2a1598535", "66631f9e-7a16-4710-a06e-86c44780a20c", "66fd40f6-81c1-435a-85e9-0dbf3b04e763", "6acd1b5a-dd4c-4d6b-8619-a907e91a32ab", "6e8ea39b-5d8f-43e5-9663-84abb1b52da6", "7f2d36af-0ef4-423c-a22a-d660d8a0f6c7", "84d6b71c-7e30-41c0-9d8c-fcd5e44b2550", "89ef9b65-f9d0-42e6-94d6-2d341d675ca5", "8b9be692-831e-40e4-97eb-ceceb0a1c319", "9464be88-80de-463e-af0c-83562b7744ff", "9734c4c6-326a-4807-ace7-a3b7f371e51b", "9e7c78f7-e27d-4cd2-b5ab-3aa8efff435d", "aed2d24e-fe61-401b-952f-7bb97915430e", "b565507b-c68a-4844-a690-50e6231aa8dd", "be24756a-da45-40e3-8629-1c43f522336f", "c0183ac9-2586-40b4-ad76-cb577472e3b1", "c0bd4ff6-2f39-49a8-8b61-f59486a007cb", "d6289f8d-fbf9-45f3-a71a-bd2ecac4c0a9", "d6513692-83aa-4b8d-9691-de32226cfcdc", "d67678fa-b55a-49c4-a79c-cdd01f6b2a4f", "ed071177-c589-4020-9c8c-12d4e8053876", "f15d0ef1-865e-4537-8ce2-91a36d61d95d", "f7e3efab-4e70-466d-99c8-de98fdff01df", "f8fbf466-9a15-414a-a900-4a17aac1f106"], "title": "RECONTEST: effective regression testing of concurrent programs", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "83019b23-fa1d-441b-b3c7-b48e529010cb"}

{"abstract": "Agile development methods are being recognized as popular and efficient approaches to the development of software systems that have features such as a short delivery period and unclear requirements. They emphasize customer satisfaction, fast response to changes, and release in less time. According to a recent survey, SCRUM is one of the most popular methods that are currently being used. Some backlogs, especially high priority backlogs that are functional requirements of customers, are developed repeatedly at each sprint period. Despite the known advantages of SCRUM, however, its backlogs focus only on functional features. Thus, it is difficult to effectively reflect the softwares quality attributes. As known, the failure of a software project is caused by the non-satisfaction not of functional features but of quality attributes, such as performance, usability, and reliability. This paper introduces the ACRUM1 that is a quality attribute driven agile development method. The main characteristic of the proposed solution is that it is derived from values and practices of SCRUM to be compatible with the SCRUM process and to keep its agility intact. The effect of ACRUM was evaluated through an agile process evaluation checklist and applying it into a commercial project of Samsung Electronics. The results showed that ACRUM is more efficient than the legacy agile development process.", "authors": ["S.W.

{"abstract": "Reusing business process artefacts, in business process modelling, can accelerate the design activity and improve the quality of the resulting products. Among the variety of reusable artefact types proposed during the last decade, Semantic Business Process Pattern (SB2P) offers business patterns that encapsulate knowledge and expertise in a particular domain. The reuse of a SB2P provides for the adoption of commonly used practices while offering guidance on possible variations. This paper proposes a reuse method that assists a business process designer, first, in retrieving an appropriate SB2P from a repository, and then adapting it through a set of instantiation operators to meet its specific requirements. The retrieval method relies on both semantic and behavioural information encapsulated in the SB2P. In addition, the instantiation operators ensure the derivation of a business process design that respects a set of quality metrics. The reuse method is illustrated through an example.", "authors": ["Lobna Makni", "Nahla Zaaboub", "Han\u00eane Ben-Abdallah"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["131e0bbf-b171-4181-affd-a50bb07467a8", "19cfa713-6e94-47ac-ab11-e605e4a7f785", "1f017fe9-1d95-4b8e-b7e2-e34d49cc3f37", "21dd58c1-57ae-4987-b3c6-4f7dec8d2ec4", "23186a73-bd08-435d-b6db-883a0c1f1ef9", "44a266bf-bb97-4a63-8014-e6229283980c", "45e230ef-3372-420a-9b0d-e5c26c8ea5c4", "465f00a8-cb1e-4c5f-bfe4-da10f35e6df7", "47003faa-9486-4145-ae1d-da1f41605db7", "68be78e4-0df7-4412-b229-0f483894e7ef", "7753c1f8-3303-4ce6-a5c3-daac9f242d84", "79667dd4-2124-49c6-b575-8f7977fac4cf", "7ad9ca4a-229c-4bde-8156-9e8a67387d02", "7cd163f9-71ac-44a7-810d-0dcff00497f0", "7e61da26-f4bc-462c-851e-4d654d77f649", "8b694188-b53f-4824-b370-cf51358de8be", "a38c588c-3ee8-4141-ac41-e646a4e5650d", "e11cfdf7-0738-41d3-a8ec-0261480b0f86", "e9a81d37-ebdf-47b6-a2c8-63807c6afcf3", "ee140ce5-2740-47c0-b4c9-74ff4f8cbaa4", "f8970379-8d40-495d-a71e-84fbed46e822"], "title": "Reuse of Semantic Business Process Patterns", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "83292eb6-4a0c-405f-85bd-e008f7f17e96"}

{"abstract": "Summary form only given. Proposes an approach for enhancing aspect-oriented software development considering aspects as first-class design entities. The proposal puts together lines of research coming from different fields, namely: aspect-oriented frameworks, aspect models extending UML models, knowledge-driven framework documentation and agent-based planning. The concept of smart-weaving promotes essentially an early incorporation of aspects in the development cycle, so that designers are able to specify their designs by means of aspect models, reuse parts of these models, and also provide different strategies to map generic aspect structures to specific implementations. With this purpose, we have built an experimental environment called Smartweaver aiming to support this process. The kind of assistance provided by the tool relies on the Smartbooks method, a method extending traditional techniques for framework documentation. Smartbooks includes a special planning agent that is able to derive the sequence of activities that should be executed to implement a given functionality from a target framework.", "authors": ["Federico Trilnik", "J.

{"abstract": "Despite their proven benefits, useful, comprehensible, and efficiently checkable specifications are not widely available. This is primarily because writing useful, non-trivial specifications from scratch is too hard, time consuming, and requires expertise that is not broadly available. Furthermore, the lack of specifications for widely-used libraries and frameworks, caused by the high cost of writing specifications, tends to have a snowball effect. Core libraries lack specifications, which makes specifying applications that use them expensive. To contain the skyrocketing development and maintenance costs of high assurance systems, this self-perpetuating cycle must be broken. The labor cost of specifying programs can be significantly decreased via advances in specification inference and synthesis, and this has been attempted several times, but with limited success. We believe that practical specification inference and synthesis is an idea whose time has come. Fundamental breakthroughs in this area can be achieved by leveraging the collective intelligence available in software artifacts from millions of open source projects. Fine-grained access to such data sets has been unprecedented, but is now easily available. We identify research directions and report our preliminary results on advances in specification inference that can be had by using such data sets to infer specifications.", "authors": ["Hridesh Rajan", "Tien N.

{"abstract": "Management of quality of service performance and resources in a shared resource environment is vital to many business domains to achieve business objectives. These management systems provide agreed levels of quality of service to their clients while allocating limited available resources among them. It is well known that the behavior of such software systems illustrate nonlinear characteristics, imposing difficulties to model and control the system. This paper proposes a nonlinear model predictive control technique for managing the performance and resources in such a shared resource environment. In particular, a block-oriented Wiener model is utilized to represent the software system as a multi-input and multi-output model in series with static nonlinear components at the outputs. Then a predictive control system is designed by compensating the estimated nonlinearities with their inverse. The simulation results show that the proposed nonlinear model predictive control mechanism has significantly improved the performance and resource management at runtime over the linear predictive control counterpart.", "authors": ["Tharindu Patikirikorala", "Liuping Wang", "Alan Colman", "Jun Han"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["a3565736-3a19-4dfc-8f5e-85f6706a4aa3", "bbe7d023-e892-47a3-bb0f-b4a825849d7a", "ea047c7e-ddf3-4cbc-9d10-b22e6dfcb95b"], "title": "Managing performance and resources in software systems using nonlinear predictive control", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "83f0bccf-9b3c-417f-9f48-e99d9b9a7f97"}

{"abstract": "Developers of highly configurable performance-intensive software systems often use a type of in-house performance-oriented \"regression testing\" to ensure that their modifications have not adversely affected their software's performance across its large configuration space. Unfortunately, time and resource constraints often limit developers to in-house testing of a small number of configurations and unreliable extrapolation from these results to the entire configuration space, which allows many performance bottlenecks and sources of QoS degradation to escape detection until systems are fielded. To improve performance assessment of evolving systems across large configuration spaces, we have developed a distributed continuous quality assurance (DCQA) process called main effects screening that uses in-the-field resources to execute formally designed experiments to help reduce the configuration space, thereby allowing developers to perform more targeted in-house QA. We have evaluated this process via several feasibility studies on several large, widely-used performance-intensive software systems. Our results indicate that main effects screening can detect key sources of performance degradation in large-scale systems with significantly less effort than conventional techniques.", "authors": ["Cemal Yilmaz", "Arvind S.

Sales of enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, according to a 2004 China Computer World (CCW) research survey, totaled 1.19 billion yuan ($144 million U.S.) in the first half of 2004, up 29% over the same period a year earlier. Human resources software posted sales growth of 80.4% for the first half of 2004 over the same period a year earlier. On the other hand, customer relationship management software sales barely crossed the 200-million-yuan mark, up 2.2% over the same period a year earlier. Nonetheless, the CCW survey anticipated a customer relationship software boom in five years when Chinese companies have had enough time to digest their operational-level IT investments and move on to more sophisticated management software.

{"abstract": "Employee Stock Options (ESOs) are call options granted by a company to its employees on the stock of the company. ESOs are an important part of company compensation and the valuation of these options has become a focus attention in finance and accounting. ESOs have special characteristics, such as: they are not tradable; they can be exercised only after the vesting period; if employees leave the company during the vesting period then the ESOs are forfeited. So valuing these options using Black-Scholes framework is less appropriate. This paper extends the model proposed by Brisley and Anderson to account for the restricted set of possible exercise dates (Bermudan style) and the state-dependent employee exit rate. We analyze the optimal early exercise decision by risk neutral valuation model. Then the price of ESOs is computed using Monte Carlo method. The Monte Carlo method is flexible and easy to implement and modify.

{"abstract": "The negative impact of smells on the quality of a software systems has been empirical investigated in several studies. This has recalled the need to have approaches for the identification and the removal of smells. While approaches to remove smells have investigated the use of both structural and conceptual information extracted from source code, approaches to identify smells are based on structural information only. In this paper, we bridge the gap analyzing to what extent conceptual information, extracted using textual analysis techniques, can be used to identify smells in source code. The proposed textual-based approach for detecting smells in source code, coined as  TACO  (Textual Analysis for Code smell detectiOn), has been instantiated for detecting the Long Method smell and has been evaluated on three Java open source projects. The results indicate that TACO is able to detect between 50% and 77% of the smell instances with a precision ranging between 63% and 67%.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a rigorous mathematical development for the design of robust intelligent type-2 fuzzy control systems with regards to the disturbance rejection problem. The majority of the papers in the literature uses only type-1 fuzzy systems for the modeling of both plant ant controller. In the control structure presented in this paper, we use type-2 fuzzy systems, which are more generalized than their type-1 counterparts and particularly known for handling uncertainties. This work extends and generalizes the previous results for the design of robust intelligent control systems.

{"abstract": "Wind power represents one of the most promising sources of renewable energy, and improvements to wind turbine design and control can have a significant impact on energy sustainability. In this paper we make two primary contributions: first, we develop and present a actuated micro wind turbine intended for research purposes. While most academic work on wind turbine control has largely focused on simulated evaluations, most turbine simulators are quite limited in their ability to model unsteady aerodynamic effects induced by the turbine; thus, there is a huge value to validating wind turbine control methods on a physical system, and the platform we present here makes this possible at a very low cost. The second contribution of this paper a novel policy search method, applied to optimizing power production in Region II wind speeds. Our method is similar in spirit to Reinforcement Learning approaches such as the REINFORCE algorithm, but explicitly models second order terms of the cost function and makes efficient use of past execution data. We evaluate this method on the physical turbine and show it it is able to quickly and repeatably achieve near-optimal power production within about a minute of execution time without an a priori dynamics model.", "authors": ["J.

{"abstract": "Estimation of a convex function is an important shape restricted nonparametric inference problem with broad applications. In this paper, penalized splines (or simply P-splines) are exploited for convex estimation. The paper is devoted to developing an asymptotic theory of a class of P-spline convex estimators using complementarity techniques and asymptotic statistics. Due to the convex constraints, the optimality conditions of P-splines are characterized by nons-mooth complementarity conditions. A critical uniform Lipschitz property is established for optimal spline coefficients. This property yields boundary consistency and uniform stochastic boundedness. Using this property, the P-spline estimator is approximated by a two-step estimator based on the corresponding least squares estimator, and its asymptotic behaviors are obtained using asymptotic statistic techniques.", "authors": ["Jinglai Shen", "Xiao Wang"], "n_citation": 7, "references": ["8e6ef059-6603-4ec4-b33c-8613e1dca5cc", "cb17fb56-8bdf-4777-883f-ab031d4957a5"], "title": "Convex regression via penalized splines: A complementarity approach", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "84a3218f-7354-424a-ab2c-44551bf9864b"}

{"abstract": "Video transmission plays a very important role in traffic applications. Noise can be a big offence in affecting encoding efficiency because it can be present throughout an entire application. Noise has the technical definition for various anomalies and unnecessary variations that get built-in into a video signal. Noise reduction enables better video quality at lower bit rates by making the source look better and decrease the video complication prior to the any process. In this proposed method we adapted the spatial video denoising methods, where image noise are reduced and are is applied to each frame individually. Since there is a great deal of removing noise from video content, this paper has been devoted to noise detection and filtering methods that aims the removing unwanted noise without affecting the clarity of scenes which contains necessary information and rapid movement. The aim of this work is to produce precise segmentation of images using intensity information along with neighborhood relationships. Most of the results of color image segmentation are based on gray level image segmentation methods with different color representations were published. Image segmentation techniques such as histogram threshold, clustering in segmentation, region growing, edge detection, fuzzy methods, and neural networks can be extended to color images.", "authors": ["M.

{"abstract": "Gaining higher level evolutionary information about large software systems is a key challenge in dealing with increasing complexity and decreasing software quality. Software repositories such as modifications, changes, or release information are rich sources for distinctive kinds of analyses: They reflect the reasons and effects of particular changes made to the software system over a certain period of time. If we can analyze these repositories in an effective way, we get a clearer picture of the status of the software. Software repositories can be analyzed to provide information about the problems concerning a particular feature or a set of features. Hidden dependencies of structurally unrelated but over time logically coupled files exhibit a high potential to illustrate software evolution and possible architectural deterioration. In this tutorial, we describe the investigation of software evolution by taking a step towards reflecting the analysis results against software quality attributes. Different kinds of analyses (from architecture to code) and their interpretation will be presented and discussed in relation to quality attributes. This will show our vision of where such evolution investigations can lead and how they can support development. For that, the tutorial will touch issues such as meta-models for evolution data, data analysis and history mining, software quality attributes, as well as visualization of analysis results.", "authors": ["Harald C.

{"abstract": "The certificateless public key cryptography (CL-PKC) is a new paradigm of modern cryptography, which was proposed to simplify the certificate management problem of PKC and to avoid the key escrow problem of identity-based cryptosystem (IBC). In this paper, we proposed an efficient and secure certificateless strong designated verifier multisignature (CL-SDVMS) scheme using elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and bilinear pairings. The proposed CL-SDVMS scheme allows a group of signers to generate a common signature on the same message intended to a designated verifier for verification. The length of the final multisignature is independent of the number of signers and identical to the length of the individual signatures, and the verification time of the multisignature is the same as the time needs to verify any individual signature generated by a signer. In addition, our multisignature scheme can be verified by a designated verifier only; however, he cannot claim to a third-party that the signature is computed by the signers or himself. The proposed scheme satisfies the properties of singer's privacy protection, strongness, non-transferability and source hiding of an SDVS scheme and is unforgeable against the adversaries of different capabilities. The proposed CL-SDVMS scheme is useful where a single document needs to be authenticated by a set of persons and applicable in various applications like decision making processes, petitions, workflow systems etc.", "authors": ["Sk Hafizul Islam", "G.

{"abstract": "The software architecture community has recently gained an increasing interest in managing architectural knowledge. However, up until now there have been no attempts to obtain an overview of the work in the field. In this paper we present a preliminary review on current approaches to architectural knowledge manage- ment. To this end, we compare approaches known from literature and encountered in industry with knowledge management theory. We found that in reports from research and practice there appears to be a preference to use the codification strategy. However, our obser- vations of the software architecture industry show that organizations in general tend to use a personalization strategy unintentionally. This paper serves as a call for awareness of this gap between intention and real- ity, and questions the biased focus on intentional cod- ification alone.

This paper surveys the most likely changes in the programming task and in the nature of software over the short term, the medium term, and the long term.  In the short term, the focus is on gains in programmer productivity through improved tools and integrated development environments. In the medium term, programmers will be able to take advantage of libraries of software components and to make use of packages that generate programs automatically for certain kinds of common systems. Over the longer term, the nature of programming will change even more significantly as programmers become able to describe desired functions in a nonprocedural way, perhaps through a set of rules or formal specification languages. As these changes occur, the job of the application programmer will become increasingly analysis-oriented and software developers will be able to attack a large number of application areas which could not previously be addressed effectively.", "authors": ["Anthony I.

{"abstract": "Android smartphones are becoming increasingly popular. The open nature of Android allows users to install miscellaneous applications, including the malicious ones, from third-party marketplaces without rigorous sanity checks. A large portion of existing malwares perform stealthy operations such as sending short messages, making phone calls and HTTP connections, and installing additional malicious components. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to detect such stealthy behavior. We model stealthy behavior as the program behavior that mismatches with user interface, which denotes the user's expectation of program behavior. We use static program analysis to attribute a top level function that is usually a user interaction function with the behavior it performs. Then we analyze the text extracted from the user interface component associated with the top level function. Semantic mismatch of the two indicates stealthy behavior. To evaluate AsDroid, we download a pool of 182 apps that are potentially problematic by looking at their permissions. Among the 182 apps, AsDroid reports stealthy behaviors in 113 apps, with 28 false positives and 11 false negatives.", "authors": ["Jianjun Huang", "Xiangyu Zhang", "Lin Tan", "Peng Wang", "Bin Liang"], "n_citation": 126, "references": ["00f4c1d6-7224-4c69-8bf7-08f1478594dc", "287c8148-98a2-472c-965a-60d42c2c0873", "4c34f825-f7dd-473b-ac67-876091f50bca", "5d2c01a9-d272-41f6-9be4-fa923a6bd568", "603ea791-f240-4695-881f-b0e7ed037e2c", "9b603fab-bb35-4a07-a49e-922b80f25ccf", "a89e5138-61e5-4269-b161-3883833984eb", "d226eb31-3043-449c-927f-81a41c252b73", "d33c0cc9-37e3-4091-b4b7-4a047bfceeb0", "da82e048-1d80-4bc5-984a-3746904f65b2", "e12440a9-0ad7-41e3-8309-dabebc30b9d0", "f17f28d1-b6d8-468f-a07d-5ddc5d5c17ef"], "title": "AsDroid: detecting stealthy behaviors in Android applications by user interface and program behavior contradiction", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "862bcf81-881d-4bce-8ede-14267a36856b"}

{"abstract": "Despite the vast body of work on self-adaption, no systematic study has been performed on the claims associated with self-adaptation and the evidence that exists for these claims. As such an insight is crucial for researchers and engineers, we performed a literature study of the research results from SEAMS since 2006 and the associated Dagstuhl seminar in 2008. The study shows that the primary claims of self-adaptation are improved flexibility, reliability, and performance of the system. On the other hand, the tradeoffs implied by self-adaptation have not received much attention. Evidence is obtained from basic examples, or simply lacking. Few systematic empirical studies have been performed, and no industrial evidence is reported. From the study, we offer the following recommendations to move the field forward: to improve evaluation, researchers should make their assessment methods, tools and data publicly available; to deal with poor discussion of limitations, conferences/workshops should require an explicit section on limitations in engineering papers; to improve poor treatment of tradeoffs, this aspect should be an explicit subject of reviews; and finally, to enhance industrial validation, the best academy-industry efforts could be formally recognized by the community.", "authors": ["Danny Weyns", "M.

{"abstract": "Developers of data-intensive applications are increasingly using persistence frameworks such as EJB, Hibernate and JDO to access relational data. These frameworks support both transparent persistence for individual objects and explicit queries to efficiently search large collections of objects. While transparent persistence is statically typed, explicit queries do not support static checking of types or syntax because queries are manipulated as strings and interpreted at runtime. This paper presents  Safe Query Objects , a technique for representing queries as statically typed objects while still supporting remote execution by a database server. Safe query objects use object-relational mapping and reflective metaprogramming to translate query classes into traditional database queries. The model supports complex queries with joins, parameters, existentials, and dynamic criteria.

{"abstract": "In this work, we explore a methodology to compute the empirical eigenfunctions for the order-reduction of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs) system with time-varying domain. The idea behind this method is to obtain the mapping functional, which relates the time-evolution scalar physical property solution ensemble of the nonlinear parabolic PDE with the time-varying domain to a fixed reference domain, while preserving space invariant properties of the raw solution ensemble. Subsequently, the Karhunen-Lo'eve decomposition is applied to the solution ensemble with fixed spatial domain resulting in a set of optimal eigenfunctions that capture the most energy of data. Further, the low dimensional set of empirical eigenfunctions is mapped (\u201cpushed-back\u201d) on the time-varying domain by an appropriate mapping resulting in the basis for the construction of the reduced-order model of the parabolic PDEs with time-varying domain. Finally, this methodology is applied in the representative cases of calculation of empirical eigenfunctions in the case of one and two dimensional model of nonlinear reaction-diffusion parabolic PDE systems with analytically defined domain evolutions. In particular, the design of both mappings which relate the raw data and function spaces transformations from the time-varying to time-invariant domain are designed to preserve dynamic features of the scalar physical property and we provide comparisons among reduced and high order fidelity models.", "authors": ["Mojtaba Izadi", "Stevan Dubljevic"], "n_citation": 5, "references": [], "title": "Computation of empirical eigenfunctions of parabolic PDEs with time-varying domain", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "8681af17-6a84-4b8a-8756-dfa15c39d015"}

Every agent holds a belief that represents her opinion on how likely it is for each of several possible states to be the true one. At each time period, agents receive private signals, and also observe the beliefs of their neighbors in a social network. They then update their beliefs by integrating the information available to them in a boundedly rational fashion. We show that in spite of agents' making new private observations perpetually and the myopic and local updating rule employed by them, agents will eventually reach consensus in their beliefs.

{"abstract": "Classical verification techniques rely on the assumption that the model of the system under analysis is completely specified and does not change over time. However, most modern development life-cycles and even run-time environments (as in the case of adaptive systems), are implicitly based on incompleteness and evolution. Incompleteness occurs when some parts of the system are not specified. Evolution concerns a set of gradual and progressive changes that amend systems over time.     Modern development life-cycles are founded on a sequence of iterative and incremental steps through which the initial incomplete description of the system evolves into its final, fully detailed, specification. Similarly, adaptive systems evolve through a set of adaptation actions, such as plugging and removing components, that modify the behavior of the system in response to new environmental conditions, requirements or legal regulations. Usually, the adaptation is performed by first removing old components, leaving the system temporarily unspecified-incomplete-, and then by plugging the new ones.

{"abstract": "Before discussing the future I want to talk about the past, which I find a source of disappointment. One of the things which prompted me to give the lecture its title was that a number of people who should know better have recently given tongue and pen to the statement that \u201cnew, second generation computers are with us\u201d and that these machines are better than anything which has been thought of before. The first part of this lecture will attempt to disabuse you of this idea for, far from thinking that any second generation computer exists, I think that we are only just seeing the growing up of first generation computers. To justify this statement I remark that, in 1946-7, I worked with the late John von Neumann on the logical and physical design of computing machines. Von Neumann wrote, at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, two reports [1, 2] on aims and objectives to which we may look to see the type of computer which was envisaged at that time. This computer was in fact a machine having, in retrospect, certain rather interesting characteristics. The most obvious of these is speed of operation and this was desired to be such that a 40 bit addition or subtraction would take about 10 micro-seconds. There is no computing machine commercially available in this country which achieves this addition time. The multiplication time of the von Neumann machine varied from 400 micro-seconds for the crudest scheme to 50 micro-seconds for a more sophisticated logical device which still made no use of the steam-roller electronics to be seen in at least one machine of the present day, which achieves a rather worse performance.

{"abstract": "\"If-Then\" classification rules are one of many types of knowledge formats mined by data mining algorithms. These rules known as classifiers are evaluated based on objective and subjective metrics. Support, coverage, confidence, precision, recall, sensitivity and specificity are objective metrics which are used in measuring the accuracy of a classifier. Subjective measures like interest, surprise and comprehensibility are more user-oriented. Users prefer classifiers which are accurate, interesting and comprehensible. Hence mining classification rules with specific properties is considered as a multi objective optimization problem. Multi objective problems choose classifiers using optimization strategies which take the metric values as a vector or as a single functional value of the metrics taken together. Depending upon the values in the fitness vector the individuals may be dominators or pure dominators. In the current study an Extended Multi Objective Cultural Algorithm (EMOCA) framework is proposed for mining dominators and pure dominators taking coverage and confidence as optimization metrics and pure Pareto domination strategy to minimize the number of rules. The performance of dominators versus pure dominators in classifying unknown data instances and in producing a compact set of rules is compared using bench mark data set and the results reported.", "authors": ["Sujatha Srinivasan", "Sivakumar Ramakrishnan"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["209c3944-f226-4134-bd68-5e7f397aaa15", "3922214f-efe1-4c85-ad73-e10416b9074a", "420d5840-2fb4-4fa4-810d-9b27972169f9", "5309d352-98ab-4f15-8e74-b7e837bb0760", "57e99685-aa60-4f95-9806-7ec0a602f40b", "8d3c7f17-a7d2-40d2-966e-936219fa9030", "9c685ed8-ceee-451b-b9ba-e6f57bfe2c26", "c490b341-7653-48a3-9f8d-24ad8ad2bf4a", "e4ebd28d-15f5-4ded-a358-8417c2874d37", "eb1fa3dc-494a-4ed2-aea8-ebf78c5333c8", "fe365ba4-a6c9-4f8a-9820-c0064413b0c8"], "title": "Dominators vs pure dominators on the accuracy of a classifier with a multi objective cultural algorithm", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "86f3c579-64a9-4c08-8175-59b13d956cc9"}

In this paper we show that a forward-in-time Riccati-based control law stabilizes the system if the dynamics of the quasi-dual system are asymptotically stable.

{"abstract": "Cloud Computing has emerged as a promising technology to provide computing resources as public utility.

It saves the organizations form the complications of building infrastructure and hence the organization can concentrate on the quality of services and products to be delivered. Though the features like cost effectiveness and scalability have made cloud popular, at the same time, the features like multi-tenancy has refrained some of the organizations dealing with confidential information, from adopting cloud. This is because in the changed computing paradigm, the information of the client is present in the vendor's premises. This implies less control over the data. For educational institutes, which need to secure the confidentiality and privacy of data, a private cloud can be a good solution. Hence we propose private cloud architecture for educational institute which can provide Infrastructure as a Service to the students and teachers without compromising the confidentiality of information.

{"abstract": "Introduction    Computer science applications are becoming more and more network centric, ubiquitous, knowledge intensive, and computing demanding. This trend will result soon in an ecosystem of pervasive applications and services that professionals and end-users can exploit everywhere. Recently, collections of IT services and applications, such as Web services and Cloud computing services, became available opening the way for accessing computing services as public utilities, like water, gas and electricity.   Key technologies for implementing that perspective are Cloud computing and Web services, semantic Web and ontologies, pervasive computing, P2P systems, Grid computing, ambient intelligence architectures, data mining and knowledge discovery tools, Web 2.0 facilities, mashup tools, and decentralized programming models. In fact, it is mandatory to develop solutions that integrate some or many of those technologies to provide future knowledge-intensive software utilities. The Grid paradigm can represent a key component of the future Internet, a cyber infrastructure for efficiently supporting that scenario.   Grid and Cloud computing are evolved models of distributed computing and parallel processing technologies. The Grid is a distributed computing infrastructure that enables coordinated resource sharing within dynamic organizations consisting of individuals, institutions, and resources. In the area of Grid computing a proposed approach in accordance with the trend outlined above is the Service-Oriented Knowledge Utilities (SOKU) model that envisions the integrated use of a set of technologies that are considered as a solution to information, knowledge and communication needs of many knowledge-based industrial and business applications. The SOKU approach stems from the necessity of providing knowledge and processing capabilities to everybody, thus supporting the advent of a competitive knowledge-based economy. Although the SOKU model is not yet implemented, Grids are increasingly equipped with data management tools, semantic technologies, complex work-flows, data mining features and other Web intelligence approaches. Similar efforts are currently devoted to develop knowledge and intelligent Clouds. These technologies can facilitate the process of having Grids and Clouds as strategic components for supporting pervasive knowledge intensive applications and utilities.   Grids were originally designed for dealing with problems involving large amounts of data and/or compute-intensive applications. Today, however, Grids enlarged their horizon as they are going to run business applications supporting consumers and end-users. To face those new challenges, Grid environments must support adaptive knowledge management and data analysis applications by offering resources, services, and decentralized data access mechanisms. In particular, according to the service-oriented architecture (SOA) model, data mining tasks and knowledge discovery processes can be delivered as services in Grid-based infrastructures.   Through a service-based approach we can define integrated services for supporting distributed business intelligence tasks in Grids. Those services can address all the aspects that must be considered in data mining and in knowledge discovery processes such as data selection and transport, data analysis, knowledge models representation and visualization. We worked in this direction for providing Grid-based architectures and services for distributed knowledge discovery such as the Knowledge Grid the Weka4WS toolkit, and mobile Grid services for data mining.   Here we describe a strategy and a model based on the use of services for the design of distributed knowledge discovery services and discuss how Grid frameworks, such those mentioned above, can be developed as a collection of services and how they can be used to develop distributed data analysis tasks and knowledge discovery processes using the SOA model.", "authors": ["Domenico Talia", "Paolo Trunfio"], "n_citation": 58, "references": ["05a734ff-1720-4c7d-8b64-1f7211fef671", "1d5fda85-fc9a-49f9-9b24-6255e204986f", "76aa7177-9704-4cc8-ae1e-69e5e00ecbe2", "8ef2b044-8fbd-461e-ae13-e2885bbbdbc1", "9726dd4c-d85a-40f6-8f63-111ae18e92f2", "b3e0f603-a699-44c3-a23d-b00f905ece2e", "b45b32ff-8bd1-4616-aa3b-cd35092a8847", "c3bb0be5-5598-4a78-939f-94c3ff2231b2", "e6b38b1a-572c-4952-bd2b-a646b369bb41", "f759246b-0edd-41c3-aac4-cb8ad6a726f4", "ff19ee6e-637a-4470-90fe-e6c8c2aa56d6"], "title": "How distributed data mining tasks can thrive as knowledge services", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2010, "id": "873ed690-d499-4c0c-812d-7602a14c1791"}

{"abstract": "In our prior work on compensation of state-dependent delays we considered globally stabilizable, forward complete systems, and designed controllers that achieve local stabilization for delay functions of the state that are arbitrary nonnegative-valued smooth functions. In this paper we remove the global assumptions and achieve the same results for plants that are locally stabilizable in the absence of delay. More specifically, we provide an affirmative answer to the question: Can nonlinear, locally stabilizable plants in the absence of input delay be stabilized by predictor-feedback in the presence of a state-dependent input delay? The key design challenge of predictor-feedback design in globally stabilizable plants is the determination of the predictor state, since the prediction horizon, that depends on the solutions of the system, is not a priori known. In the case of locally stabilizable plants, one is faced with an additional challenge: not only does the control signal have to reach the plant in finite time, but it has to reach it within the region of attraction of the delay-free plant. We resolve this challenge by providing an estimate of the time when the control signal reaches the plant. We also provide an example of a system which is neither globally stabilizable nor locally exponential stabilizable in the absence of the delay.", "authors": ["Nikolaos Bekiaris-Liberis", "Miroslav Krstic"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["004ab25d-ab5f-479c-b72b-b4a32106f9f6", "1459c2bd-c1b5-4ed3-846e-2d01aecebbe0", "1c943450-1665-4747-a62a-87f26eda7ce4", "2fb4e729-5244-44f8-b10f-383bf0166656", "301f587a-d1d2-4a41-b8e9-933a20c6fb42", "33d09be3-aae2-47ee-a231-f05c21c94c9a", "45c41a2e-0d29-454f-9b19-9b9bb034babb", "7027dc08-e52e-4609-888c-924d51e56289", "7144070e-e156-4f21-9358-415539485c9c", "7189ca8a-e859-4848-a594-81cf6da97566", "99f94727-1c80-47b4-8a32-42d273893c43", "ac2e8959-4c7b-4787-931a-34dfa0196b94", "d1566b3a-b17e-4d17-a2cd-ee090618e5d9", "dbc8957a-ec6a-4e9c-8685-7ce4f940140d"], "title": "Compensation of state-dependent delays under local stabilizability assumption", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "876ad234-40f1-4c78-b091-75dc9d6f44a6"}
{"abstract": "A discretization method is proposed for continuous -time, non-autonomous, and nonlinear systems. The concept of continualization is used to derive a sufficient condition for a given discrete-time system to be an exact discretization of a continuous-time system. The proposed discretization method is based on an approximate solution to this condition, which is computed using Peano-Baker series. As an example, an inverted pendulum subjected to high-frequency excitation is considered. Simulation results show that the proposed method has good performances even with a relatively large sampling interval. I. INTRODUCTION Numerical simulations and on-line computations of nonlinear continuous-time systems, for which no complete solutions are known, require conversion of their governing equations into ones in discrete-time formats. A number of researchers have worked on this topic in a variety of fields, including engineering systems and control (1-4). While accurate discretization methods, such as Runge-Kutta schemes, are available for off-line simulations, those that lead to on-line computable algorithms, such as those used for digital control or prediction, are still relatively rare. Some discretization methods, such as multi-step schemes, make the order of difference equations higher than that of the original differential equations, and can lead to numerical instabilities unless a sufficiently small sampling interval is used. The simplest and widely-applicable discretization method for on-line computation is the forward-difference model. However, this model has a performance that is usually poor unless a sufficiently small sampling interval is used. In some cases this model yields dynamics that differ from those of continuous-time systems even for a small sampling interval. While some better discretization methods have been proposed (5-6), they are mainly intended for autonomous nonlinear systems. Non-autonomous systems contain time-varying parameters and functions that cannot be treated properly as constants within a sampling interval. This makes the relationship between continuous-time systems and their discrete-time models more complicated, and the discretization methods for non-autonomous systems more difficult, even for linear systems. Studies on this issue have been limited practically to linear (7) and a few nonlinear (8) systems. Therefore, at present, the forward difference method is virtually the only on-line computable discretization method that is applicable to a wide range of nonlinear systems", "authors": ["Triet Nguyen-Van", "Noriyuki Hori", "Meyer Nahon"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["4074258c-4d2d-4e8c-9724-3758b2e39f10", "65b5792a-1158-4559-a19f-96ba1df257c0", "a7582d8c-2c44-4aa8-8027-7a144c234dbd"], "title": "A discrete-time model of nonlinear non-autonomous systems", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2014, "id": "876e096f-a109-47b5-8821-604ad798183a"}

{"abstract": "Defect prediction techniques could potentially help us to focus quality-assurance efforts on the most defect-prone files. Modern statistical tools make it very easy to quickly build and deploy prediction models. Software metrics are at the heart of prediction models; understanding how and especially why different types of metrics are effective is very important for successful model deployment. In this paper we analyze the applicability and efficacy of process and code metrics from several different perspectives. We build many prediction models across 85 releases of 12 large open source projects to address the performance, stability, portability and stasis of different sets of metrics. Our results suggest that code metrics, despite widespread use in the defect prediction literature, are generally less useful than process metrics for prediction. Second, we find that code metrics have high stasis; they don't change very much from release to release. This leads to stagnation in the prediction models, leading to the same files being repeatedly predicted as defective; unfortunately, these recurringly defective files turn out to be comparatively less defect-dense.", "authors": ["Foyzur Rahman", "Premkumar T.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we introduce an approach called as adaptive weight-based cross-correlation method to estimate the disparity map for a pair of underwater images. A majority of the existing stereo correspondence algorithms assume that the corresponding color values are similar to each other. However, it is not in the case of underwater images; variations in corresponding color values are very high due to factors such as, attenuation and scattering of light in underwater environment. The attenuation and scattering of light cause variations in the measured color of each scene point at its projections on the two images, which leads to radiometric variations between a pair of images. We employ comprehensive color image normalization method to normalize the input color images. The conventional correlation methods compute the disparity at a given point depends only on intensity values within a local window, but these techniques are sensitive to illuminative variations and relatively lower performance in the featureless regions. Therefore, instead of intensity value, we use color dependent adaptive weights computed for each pixel lies within support window, and the cross-correlation measure between the support window is employed to estimate the disparity. The experiments are evaluated qualitatively, and the result reveals that our method outperforms the conventional correlation methods under conditions such as variations in illumination and blur.", "authors": ["Kumar P.

The goals of this paper are to document the main reasons given for moving developer support to Stack Overflow, and then to collect and analyze data from a group of software projects that have done this, in order to show whether the expected quality of support was actually achieved. The analysis shows that for all four software projects in this study, two of the desired quality indicators, developer participation and response time, did show improvements on Stack Overflow as compared to mailing lists and forums. However, we also found several projects that moved back from Stack Overflow, despite achieving these desired improvements. The results of this study are applicable to a wide variety of software projects that provide developer support using social media.", "authors": ["Megan Squire"], "n_citation": 19, "references": ["09dced28-4ad9-47a3-a2b8-4c7190cf58ea", "0df40bf4-73a1-427b-9562-99386ff1f433", "13ea7ea4-90ba-4287-ae75-de35d799221c", "9876c390-bf9b-489a-81d6-b17ae7a00878", "ac496ab1-6ee4-4c21-a770-0e6adb9edf63", "d89eedaf-207f-43ea-831f-631dca6d396c", "f7ebfca6-f5ff-432a-ba8d-85e728d743e4"], "title": "Should we move to stack overflow?: measuring the utility of social media for developer support", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "87be2115-dc57-4e28-96a3-8f1ff12881b4"}
{"abstract": "Web caching is used to reduce the network traffic by caching web pages at the proxy server level. Nowadays caching alone is not sufficient because of World Wide Web has evolved rapidly from a simple information-sharing mechanism. This mechanism offer only static text and images to a rich assortment of dynamic and interactive services, such as video/audio conferencing, e-commerce and distance learning. Web is demanding to improve the cache performance. If we use the prefetching technique with caching then the performance of cache is improved. Prefetching fetches objects that are likely to be accessed in the near future and store them in advance thus the response time of the user request is reduced. In this paper, our main objective is to give a new framework to improve performance of web proxy server using web usage mining and prefetching scheme. Further, we cluster the user according to their access pattern and usage behavior with the help of K-Means algorithm and then Apriori algorithm is applied to generate rules for prefetching pages. This cluster based approach is applied on proxy server web log data to test the results using LRU and LFU prefetching schemes.", "authors": ["Nanhay Singh", "Arvind Panwar", "Ram Shringar Raw"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["010793c8-fedb-49ee-88bc-1e20f8bae870", "1d7a3238-67c8-45a1-a6a3-9ebbce2f646a", "2fdf0cfb-c1c7-45be-8d64-13f7e82182af", "714bf6ea-6a85-4c82-95f0-9164236bf8b2", "731476cc-0c0f-464b-b397-30192a249ebf", "8c5aacae-f812-42ce-87d7-98c7b18ecb59", "b011cae2-68ba-4784-b2da-71948c8e618f", "cdb94f9d-715a-48d9-8e91-e0dc03bf455f", "d7f24430-55cd-4647-94ee-5a8b6f91c477", "d92cbd50-3466-42a8-af48-ad5cf6079b10", "decd8f3b-6af9-4c93-bc39-f0d975d1f6e8"], "title": "Enhancing the performance of web proxy server through cluster based prefetching techniques", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "87bf6a0f-52a2-46e8-8917-5db4343653a9"}

{"abstract": "Biological systems have shown great abilities for navigating dense and uncertain environments with variable winds or currents. These animals have unique sensors that allow them to detect the local flowfield and adjust their motor controls accordingly. One approach to leveraging biological sensing capabilities for engineered systems is to understand the sensing from a theoretical perspective. In this paper, flowfield observability and estimation is addressed in the framework of detecting vortices in the flow around a flapping airfoil. An unsteady potential flow model is developed, and the flowfield is measured using velocity sensors placed on the surface of the airfoil. The observability characteristics are identified using two methods, which reveal that for a set of surface velocity sensors, nonzero pitch and heave controls are required to achieve full state observability of airfoil velocities, angle-of-attack, and vortex locations and strengths. These interesting results indicate that wing flapping increases environment observability for animals with wing-mounted velocity sensors. The observability results are demonstrated in simulation with an unscented Kalman filter to estimate a discrete number of vortices in the wake of the flapping foil. Although the filter assumes only a small number of vortices to be estimated, the UKF is able to capture the structure of the wake vorticity.", "authors": ["Brian T. Hinson", "Kristi A.

{"abstract": "This paper describes a model-based control design for a solid oxide fuel cell and gas turbine (SOFC/GT) combined cycle system. One-step ahead predictive control is formulated to (1) meet the power demand effectively, (2) handle the multiple constraints of the hybrid system, and (3) minimize the fuel consumption. An SOFC/GT control strategy with two sequential optimization loops is proposed. The primary controller is designed to achieve the system net power, the targeted fuel utilization, and high fuel economy by manipulating the fuel cell current and the anode fuel flow rate. The secondary controller minimizes the fuel cell temperature variation during transients by adjusting the generator load. Simulation results show that the control strategy is capable of achieving fast load transitions while maintaining the fuel utilization within the feasible range. The one-step ahead prediction control is shown to provide the benefits of on-line optimization without incurring large computation burden.", "authors": ["So-Ryeok Oh", "Jing Sun", "Herbert Dobbs", "Joel King"], "n_citation": 4, "references": [], "title": "Model-based predictive control strategy for a solid oxide fuel cell system integrated with a turbocharger", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "87d75d98-ad4f-4e2b-9bbd-5e46ac232d53"}

Furthermore, this formulation is extended to cross machines and it shows that these semantic features can be structured in a unified mathematical framework. In this framework, an algorithm of supervised learning is formulated for generating semantic features in the setting of linear discriminant analysis (LDA).

{"abstract": "Cognitive radio technology allows the unlicensed users to utilize spectrum by sensing it reliably. The main obstacles in this sensing are fading and shadowing effects which are overcome using cooperative strategies as: amplify-and-relay (AR) and detect-and-relay (DR). In these strategies, noise received at relay is also amplified and relayed along with the signal, which limits their detection performance at the detector or the end user. In this paper, wavelet denoising (WD) is used to denoise the received signal before energy detection as well as before relaying the signal, and therefore, improving the detection performance. A Chi-square approximation using the cumulants is used to compute the probabilities, and an inverse mapping pseudo-code is utilized to calculate the threshold values at a given false alarm rate. The agreement of analytical and simulation results show that AR and DR (with WD) strategies perform better than plain AR and DR (without WD) in terms of detection probability.", "authors": ["Navneet Garg", "Aditya Trivedi"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["5b3d355e-f43b-4bd1-b505-7338c5e67a7d", "af7258d3-1e53-4b04-bb06-540ffa3f40b8", "b2b81099-86e4-42c7-9b40-a2e34ccbb72a", "bdbf984d-bb13-48c9-972e-78b0e1af287a", "d1ba534e-3f80-4366-bb83-be16006f9e18", "f7a8c242-fc5e-4e36-b02d-2df1d7ab8a69"], "title": "Improved cooperative sensing strategies using wavelet denoising", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "87e90a3b-aa49-4448-9f2d-ed9252186bf7"}

First, this approach maximizes the network's utility, as a function of the signal to interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), by considering adaptively the changes in the three most important network characteristics, that is, the total consumed power, the effective bandwidth and the average user throughput.

{"abstract": "Large software systems have a large number of components and are developed over a long time period frequently by a large number of people. We describe a framework approach to evolving such systems based on an integration of product and process modelling. The evolving system is represented as a Product Tower, a hierarchy of components which provides views of the product at multiple levels of refinement. The evolution process is component based with the cooperation between components being mediated by the Product Tower. This ensures that the evolution process is scaleable and that it maintains, and evolves, the design model. We illustrate our approach with an example, outlining an evolution both of the product and of the process. The reflexive facilities of the process are shown to be key in ensuring the framework's ability to evolve.", "authors": ["R.M.

{"abstract": "This paper introduces a novel methodology for self correction scheme based fast multi criterion exploration and automated architectural synthesis of data dominated applications. The four major novel contributions of the paper are as follows: a) Introduction of two new algorithms that is able to efficiently tackle conditions when the user provided high level constraint values are invalid in nature. This is done using an algorithm to validate the user constraints as well as an algorithm to self rectify the user constraints value automatically if the final Pareto optimal set is found vacant b) Introduction of a novel input format for data flow graph applications and its custom representation c) Introduction of a novel algorithm that is capable to perform automated architectural synthesis using techniques to convert from scheduling to circuit interconnection phase. These new algorithms have been incorporated into a multi criterion design space exploration framework d) New experimental results are reported for the results obtained through proposed multi criterion exploration approach and its speed improvement compared to recent approach. The proposed method, when applied to High Level Synthesis (HLS) benchmarks, yielded speed improvement of more than 90 % compared to recent DSE approach without sacrificing quality of final solution.", "authors": ["Anirban Sengupta"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["171a09d3-b1c9-4d02-9464-1ca2350fdaa2", "5193a353-d6a9-4500-94cc-45f471d88076", "55756e48-f3cd-48ef-a6dd-77b0b61d2648", "6ce93193-a69f-4869-9b90-6bc15cd44f63", "967413b5-3563-418b-a466-dcb2a88db70b"], "title": "A methodology for self correction scheme based fast multi criterion exploration and architectual synthesis of data dominated applications", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "88d07d09-82c5-47d0-aae6-6d3990bf0f82"}

The work presented in this paper aims to contribute to a software engineering process which is driven by security, risk and compliance management considerations.   We concentrate on a part of this approach that focusses on the question how one can use software engineering methods and tools to enforce that the configuration of a system enforces the security policies that arise from business compliance regulations. We present tool support for Model-based Compliance Engineering, i.e. for the model-based development and analysis of software configurations that ensures compliance with security policies. It allows one to check UML models of business applications and their configuration data for adherence to security policies and compliance requirements.

{"abstract": "This paper addresses itself to the problem of analyzing data generated by computer simulations of economic systems. We first turn to a hypothetical firm, whose operation is represented by a single-channel, multistation queueing model. The firm seeks to maximize total expected profit for the coming period by selecting one of five operating plans, where each plan incorporates a certain marketing strategy, an allocation of productive inputs, and a total cost.  The results of the simulated activity under each plan are subjected to an  F -test, two multiple comparison methods, and a multiple ranking method. We illustrate, compare, and evaluate these techniques. The paper adopts the position that the particular technique of analysis (possibly not any one of the above) chosen by the experimenter should be an expression of his experimental objective: The  F -test tests the homogeneity of the plans; multiple comparison methods quantify their differences; and multiple ranking methods directly identify the one best plan or best plans.", "authors": ["Thomas H.

{"abstract": "The advent of service-oriented architectures has strongly facilitated the development and deployment of large-scale distributed applications. The middleware for orchestrating applications that consist of several distributed services has to be inherently distributed as well, in order to provide a high degree of scalability and to avoid any single point of failure. Self-healing execution of composite services requires replicated control metadata and instance data in a way that does not affect adaptivity and elasticity of the middleware. In this paper, we present OSIRIS-SR, a decentralized approach to self-healing composite service execution in a distributed environment. OSIRIS-SR exploits dedicated node monitors, organized in a self-organizing Safety Ring, for the replication of control data. Moreover, OSIRIS-SR leverages virtual stable storage for managing composite service instance data in a robust way. We present the architecture of OSIRIS-SR's Safety Ring and discuss how it provides self-healing composite service execution.

{"abstract": "The General Intensional Programming System (GIPSY) has been built around the Lucid family of intensional programming languages that rely on the higher-order intensional logic (HOIL) to provide context-oriented multidimensional reasoning of intensional expressions. HOIL combines functional programming with various intensional logics to allow explicit context expressions to be evaluated as first-class values that can be passed as parameters to functions and return as results with an appropriate set of operators defined on contexts. GIPSY's frameworks are implemented in Java as a collection of replaceable components for the compilers of various Lucid dialects and the demand-driven eductive evaluation engine that can run distributively. GIPSY provides support for hybrid programming models that couple intensional and imperative languages for a variety of needs. Explicit context expressions limit the scope of evaluation of math expressions (effectively a Lucid program is a mathematics or physics expression constrained by the context) in tensor physics, regular math in multiple dimensions, etc., and for cyberforensic reasoning as one of the use-cases of interest. Thus, GIPSY is a support testbed for HOIL-based languages some of which enable such reasoning, as in formal cyberforensic case analysis with event reconstruction.

{"abstract": "Reaction systems can be represented by first-principles models that describe the evolution of the states (typically concentrations, volume and temperature) by means of conservation equations of differential nature and constitutive equations of algebraic nature. The resulting models often contain redundant states since the various concentrations are not all linearly independent; indeed, the variability observed in the concentrations is caused by the reactions, the mass transferred between phases, the inlet and outlet streams. A minimal state representation is a dynamic model that exhibits the same behavior as the original model but has no redundant state. This paper considers the material balance equations associated with an open fluid-fluid reaction system that involves S l  species, R independent reactions, p l  independent inlets and one outlet in the first fluid phase (e.g. the liquid phase) and S g  species, p g  independent inlets and one outlet in the second fluid phase (e.g. the gas phase). In addition, there are p m  species transferring between the two phases. The (S l +S g )-dimensional model is transformed to q = R + 2p m  + p l  + p g  +2 variant states and S l  +S g  -q invariant states. Then, using the concept of accessibility of nonlinear systems, the conditions under which the transformed model is a minimal state representation are derived. It will be shown that the minimal number of concentration measurements needed to reconstruct the full state without kinetic information is R + p m . The simulated chlorination of butanoic acid is used to illustrate the various concepts developed in the paper.", "authors": ["Nirav Bhatt", "Michael Amrhein", "Balasubrahmanya Srinivasan", "Philippe M\u00fcllhaupt", "Dominique Bonvin"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["390c4de6-bfff-4c2f-819d-5a28e420673d", "d64d5981-3c4e-41a0-bb54-12ced7fa31a4"], "title": "Minimal state representation for open fluid-fluid reaction systems", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "8922804e-2262-45e1-8e55-36752c9e6c4c"}
{"abstract": "Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce has great potential to create new efficiencies for industries and their supply chains. While Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) over private networks has been used extensively for data interchange among large enterprises, it has had limitations of cost and rigid format specification that have precluded widespread adoption. Further, due to its batched nature, EDI is not well-suited to intensive real-time information exchange and application integration needed for supply chain activities such as collaborative forecasting and inventory management. A number of supply chains now use just-in-time manufacturing processes and require quick access to information received from partner enterprises that EDI does not support. EDI does provide the connectivity and structured data interfaces needed for exchange of business information in one-to-one relationships, but it does not support process standards that would specify how IT applications at dynamic partnering enterprises need to process this data. Data interchange using the Internet infrastructure has emerged as a viable platform for commerce, particularly due to the eXtensible Markup Language (XML) specification for document markup that eliminates the need to find a common application interface (API) for integrating inter-enterprise applications. XML-based dialogs among applications at different enterprises can define business processes between trading partners. A continuing obstacle to widespread B2B commerce over the Internet, using XML documents as the payload, is the lack of business standards that would lay out the document schemas and the conditional choreography of document exchanges needed to complete a business process extended across multiple enterprises [2]. Without such standards, there is no common vocabulary to describe products, there is low visibility in the supply chain as sell-through information is difficult to aggregate, there", "authors": ["Sanjay Gosain", "Arvind Malhotra", "Omar A.

It is shown that the only statistic of HB[1] trees (AVL trees) that is a function of the size of the tree is the time to search for an item in the tree. For sufficiently large trees, the execution times of all procedures for maintaining HB[1] trees are independent of the size of the tree. In particular, an average of .465 restructures are required per insertion, with an average of 2.78 nodes revisited to restore the HB[1] property; an average of .214 restructures are required per deletion, with an average of 1.91 nodes revisited to restore the HB[1] property. Moreover, the execution times of procedures for maintaining HB[k] trees, for k > 1, are also independent of the size of the tree except for the average number of nodes revisited on a delete operation in order to restore the HB[k] property on traceback. The cost of maintaining HB[k] trees drops sharply as the allowable imbalance (k) increases.

The guidance law based on nonsingular terminal sliding mode guarantees finite time convergence of interceptor to the desired impact angle.

{"abstract": "Various data gathering techniques using mobile collectors have been developed for energy saving in wireless sensor network. In the sensor field, a mobile collector may traverse within the transmission range of each sensor node to collect data directly from them without any relay. But as the velocity of a mobile collector is low, the data gathering latency may arises which is not desire for many time sensitive applications. To minimize data gathering latency, local data may be aggregated using multi hop transmissions and those collected data may be uploaded to the mobile collector. But, if the number of local relay hop is arbitrarily large then it may increase consumption of energy on packet relays and thus the overall efficiency of mobile data gathering may be reduced. Also, sensor has the limited buffer capacity to store data. So, the relay hop count should be constrained to a certain level to limit the energy consumption at sensors. In this work we have proposed a data collection point based approach that establishes a balance between the energy savings and data gathering latency, which makes an adjustment between the relay hop count for local data aggregation and the moving tour length of the mobile collector. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach and provides better average relay hop count than other mobile data gathering schemes of same type.", "authors": ["Srijit Chowdhury", "Chandan Giri"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["2afe61a9-e975-4f62-930e-1606242d19f9", "2b49290c-0234-4956-9821-ab4e2589553e", "3fcb8e17-ffb2-4c15-87e2-2389f1bad598", "7ad6c4b1-80e8-4387-8dc6-64a90b02a7b1", "83b292ff-fab6-468d-b8aa-0392cdf42e52", "89fdcc3d-8d1a-4e43-bf16-0649009ea671", "af1af1c2-2fe2-49cc-9fea-d6f5faf11eaa"], "title": "Data collection point based mobile data gathering scheme with relay hop constraint", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "898cbc8b-f6a9-4c6e-b6a4-7f086a915bc9"}
{"abstract": "The rapid advances in the field of Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) are expected to enrich the quality of people\u2019s lives. BCI connects computer actions with neural inputs\u2014signals indicating the user\u2019s intentions, desired actions, attention, thoughts, memories, and emotions. BCI applications present significant challenges for computer science and software engineering research: an avalanche of neural signals will make their way as direct input into software systems. Given the differences between neural inputs and behavioral ones, the integration of neural inputs will require special approaches, and not simply adding yet more user interface channels to pre-existing software systems. This paper explores the challenges of designing and implementing self-adaptive software systems that could synergize brain states. After framing the problem, its rationale and possible solutions, in this paper we argue that the software engineering community ought to investigate how to incorporate neural inputs into software systems.

{"abstract": "In the 1940s, television and radio combinations like the one on the left were the precursors of today's \"entertainment centers .\" About 25 years later, black and white television gave way to color. The next leap, high resolution television coupled with CD quality stereo may be coming soon. Last April, in the deep hours of the night, NBC, Channel 4 in New York City, announced a test: viewers would witness the first broadcast of the Sarnoff Research Center's Advanced Compatible Television system. The program of choice: the Saint Patrick's Day Parade. Researchers at the Sarnoff Center in Princeton, NJ, watched the signal, which emanated from WNBC at the World Trade Center in New York, on experimental high-definition monitors. The Sarnoff group, along with ABC and General Electric's consumer electronics division, has invested $60 million to develop a system that has twice the lines of regular TV screens (1050), scans at the same rate (29.97 frames per second), and enhances the current standard signal. A planned two-step approach to advanced television, the second phase would provide greater detail to those who bought wide-screen monitors, but it still would be compatible with today's TVs.  The Sarnoff system is one of 20 advanced television research projects under way in this country, including those of the Zenith Electronics Group in cooperation with AT&T Microelectronics, Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Advanced Television Research Program, the New York Institute of Technology, the Del-Ray Group, and North American Philips. Many have applied for matching funds from DARPA, which has earmarked $30 million for the next three years\u2014half slated for transmission research and half for display technology. As of August 1989, five companies had been granted money for display technology. Newco Inc. of San Jose, CA, Raychem Corporation of Menlo Park, CA, Texas Instruments Inc. of Dallas, TX, and Projectavision Inc. of New York will receive money for projection display systems. Photonics Technology Inc. of Northwood, OH, was selected for flat panel display technology.

{"abstract": "In this paper we study the problem of real-time optimal distributed partitioning for perimeter patrolling in the context of multi-camera networks for surveillance. The objective is to partition a given segment into non-overlapping sub-segments, each assigned to a different camera to patrol. Each camera has both physical mobility range and limited speed, and it must patrol its assigned sub-segment by sweeping it back and forth at maximum speed. Here we first review the solution for the centralized optimal partitioning. Then we propose two different distributed control strategies to determine the extremes of the optimal patrolling areas of each camera. Both these strategies require only local communication with the neighboring cameras but adopt different communication schemes, respectively, symmetric gossip and asynchronous asymmetric broadcast. The first scheme is shown to be provably convergent to the optimal solution. Some theoretical insights are provided also for the second scheme whose effectiveness is validated through numerical simulations.", "authors": ["Riccardo Alberton", "Ruggero Carli", "Angelo Cenedese", "Luca Schenato"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["123872f0-bca5-46ee-b0ae-0b67374f7772", "12ce53f7-0d63-4918-8fca-8a3d2c1dfdbf", "31e48f90-3ccd-4b05-afa2-d8cbe1f0b2de", "f455fb4e-dca1-41d0-8e94-865d8f0dbfe9", "f52ad42a-ca63-4443-a9f1-2fd6298a0192", "faef8551-ed26-4b62-b150-d9a0a6561033"], "title": "Multi-agent perimeter patrolling subject to mobility constraints", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "89cc414a-4ecc-4f21-bdc8-e5a7cc5a4595"}

{"abstract": "Introduction    The idea of doing things that can improve something is an extremely popular concept in American culture. For example, I found the phrase,  make a difference , in 129 million Web pages in a Yahoo! search in July 2009. The concept typically applies to impacts at local levels because, until recently, few people had opportunities to do things that could positively affect substantial numbers of people throughout the country in which they live or even throughout the world.   After dot com bubble burst, many investors found that the slogan that \"the Internet changes everything\" did not apply to many of the requirements for having a successful business. However the Internet really does provide opportunities for those who create knowledge to share it with more people who can use it to advantage, and share it more quickly than through other means.   Of course, this potential capability to share materials is limited by people's abilities to find useful information in the billions of pages on the Internet. Yahoo reported indexing over 19 billion pages in 2005. (Perhaps responding to criticism of the estimates, 1  the leading search engine companies no longer publish counts of pages indexed. Although no one really knows how big the \"haystack\" is, the simile about \"finding a needle\" is quite applicable to the Internet.)   Nevertheless there are two aspects of innovative materials that work in favor of their being found:   \u2022 The goals of search engine companies.   \u2022 The nature of knowledge.", "authors": ["Ralph D.

{"abstract": "Test automation, which involves the conversion of manual test cases to executable test scripts, is necessary to carry out efficient regression testing of GUI-based applications. However, test automation takes significant investment of time and skilled effort. Moreover, it is not a one-time investment: as the application or its environment evolves, test scripts demand continuous patching. Thus, it is challenging to perform test automation in a cost-effective manner. At IBM, we developed a tool, called ATA [1], [2], to meet this challenge. ATA has novel features that are designed to lower the cost of initial test automation significantly. Moreover, ATA has the ability to patch scripts automatically for certain types of application or environment changes. How well does ATA meet its objectives in the real world? In this paper, we present a detailed case study in the context of a challenging production environment: an enterprise web application that has over 6500 manual test cases, comes in two variants, evolves frequently, and needs to be tested on multiple browsers in time-constrained and resource-constrained regression cycles. We measured how well ATA improved the efficiency in initial automation. We also evaluated the effectiveness of ATA's change-resilience along multiple dimensions: application versions, browsers, and browser versions.

These high performance systems require correspondingly more complex and aggressive active control loops to meet the increased demand in instrument sensitivity.

Business management, marketing, and accounting subjects were added to the new curriculum, and students made information technology (IT) business plans using their knowledge of software engineering and business management. The IT business plans were submitted to various contests held by public newspaper companies and the federation of economic organizations in Japan. As a result, in the 10 years of the contest-based learning implementation, 20 teams have received awards in various IT business plan contests. We investigated 10 persons who had experience submitting business plans.

{"abstract": "Technological innovations---such as the telephone, television, and the Internet---enable new capabilities that may create long-lasting changes in organizational structure, conduct, and performance. E-commerce currently accounts for a small portion of the U.S. economy, and an even smaller portion of the economies of other developed countries. Hence, marketers imperfectly understand the long-run ramifications of e-commerce for the behavior of buyers and sellers, organizational conduct and performance, the function and evolution of markets, and public policy. For example, there are differences between traditional and computer-mediated buying environments, with the latter characterized by increased information flows, interactivity, reduced information asymmetry between buyers and sellers, and a shift away from geographically based competition.

{"abstract": "Software engineering lacks underpinning scientific theories both for the software it produces and the processes by which it does so. We propose that an approach based on information theory can provide such a theory, or rather many theories. We envision that such a benefit will be realised primarily through research based on the quantification of information involved and a mathematical study of the limiting laws that arise. However, we also argue that less formal but more qualitative uses for information theory will be useful.   The main argument in support of our vision is based on the fact that both a program and an engineering process to develop such a program are fundamentally processes that transform information. To illustrate our argument we focus on software testing and develop an initial theory in which a test suite is input/output adequate if it achieves the channel capacity of the program as measured by the mutual information between its inputs and its outputs. We outline a number of problems, metrics and concrete strategies for improving software engineering, based on information theoretical analyses. We find it likely that similar analyses and subsequent future research to detail them would be generally fruitful for software engineering.", "authors": ["David Clark", "Robert Feldt", "Simon M.

Wasserstein distance which defines a metric on the manifold of probability density functions is used as tool for the performance and the stability measures. Starting with Gaussian distribution to represent the initial state uncertainties, the probability density function of the system state evolves into mixture of Gaussian, where the number of Gaussian components grows exponentially. To cope with computational complexity caused by mixture of Gaussian, we prove that there exists an alternative probability density function that preserves exact information in the Wasserstein level.

{"abstract": "Backtracting  is a well-known technique for solving combinatorial problems. It is of interest to programming methodologists because (1) correctness of backtracking programs may be difficult to ascertain experimentally and (2) efficiency is often of paramount importance. This paper applies a programming methodology, which we call  control structure abstraction , to the backtracking technique. The value of control structure abstraction in the context of correctness is that proofs of general properties of a class of programs with similar control structures are separated from proofs of specific properties of individual programs of the class. In the context of efficiency, it provides sufficient conditions for correctness of an initial program which may subsequently be improved for efficiency while preserving correctness.", "authors": ["Susan L.

We also report the results of a controlled experiment, with 59 end-user subjects, to investigate the usefulness of this approach.

{"abstract": "It is generally agreed that to meet these objectives and achieve integration an IPSE should be built round a kernel or infrastructure of common services.  Coherence is then achieved if the infrastructure provides services to tools which relieve the toolwriter of the need to code, for example, user interface handling. Not only does this aid uniformity, but of course it also offers economic leverage.  Control of the environment resides in the kernel and it is not possible for tools to ignore the controls and prejudice the integrity of the project data.  Sharing is achieved because the project data and its structure reside in the database which is under the control of the kernel.  Early efforts to build such an IPSE were based on the STONEMAN model, where the kernel was the KAPSE. The crucial interface in this architecture is the KAPSE interface, which offers services to all tools. We did not sufficiently realise, however, that there is a major economic problem in designing a new interface from scratch. All tools which are to be used in an environment must, by definition, conform to this interface definition. This means that all the tools have to be specially written to use the new interface, and it became apparent that no single organisation could or should expect to provide a complete new tool kit in this way. Rather one wants an open market in software tools, in the same way that it is hoped Ada will lead to an open market in software components. The more recent history of IPSE efforts, therefore, has been an attempt to resolve the conflict between the desire for integration and the need for environments to accept a wide range of tools from various sources.   Perhaps the most ambitious project taking this approach is ASPECT, a project within the UK Alvey programme, which is currently delivering prototypes for evaluation. ASPECT aims to provide a highly functional Open Tool Interface covering coherence, control and sharing. It does this by treating the Open Tool Interface as a special case of an adaptable interface which provides user-defined views of the underlying kernel. This approach depends heavily on the notions of views developed in the relational database world.", "authors": ["Anthony Hall"], "n_citation": 50, "title": "Tool interfaces in integrated project support environments", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 1987, "id": "8ac41fa4-bdee-4eb4-8533-c86003fad609"}
{"abstract": "An iterative redesign algorithm is proposed to integrate the design of the structural parameters and a linear parameter varying (LPV) controller for a wind turbine. The LPV controller is designed for a lumped model of the wind turbine with five degrees-of-freedom consisting of blades, drivetrain and the tower. The controller is scheduled in real-time based on the mean wind speed. The controller objective is to track an optimal power generation trajectory and minimize the H \u221e  performance index from the wind turbulence disturbance to the controlled output vector. The solution of the problem is formulated as an iterative sequential controller/structure redesign to obtain the values corresponding to a local optimal performance index. Each step of the iterative procedure is formulated as a linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization problem that can be solved efficiently using available LMI solvers. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the algorithm in converging to a local optimal solution and improving the overall performance of the system in FAST closed-loop responses via the integrated design.", "authors": ["Farzad A.

The central idea is to calculate the vertices of the state space polytopes, and to construct the pieces of the piecewise affine control law from only the vertices. We show that information calculated at the vertex suffices to infer the control laws that surround a given vertex. Consequently, it is not necessary to computationally construct and evaluate points in the interior of the polytopes.

{"abstract": "Resource-constrained devices are becoming ubiquitous. Examples include cell phones, Palm Pilots and digital thermostats. It can be difficult to fit the required functionality into such a device without sacrificing the simplicity and clarity of the software. Increasingly complex embedded systems require extensive brute-force testing, making development and maintenance costly. This is particularly true for system components that are written in assembly language. Static checking has the potential of alleviating these problems, but until now there has been little tool support for programming at the assembly level. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a static checker for interrupt-driven Z86-based software with hard real-time requirements. For six commercial microcontrollers, our checker has produced upper bounds on interrupt latencies and stack sizes, as well as verified fundamental safety and liveness properties. Our approach is based on a known algorithm for the model checking of pushdown systems and produces a control-flow graph annotated with information about time, space, safety and liveness. Each benchmark is approximately 1000 lines of code, and the checking is done in a few seconds on a standard PC. Our tool is one of the first to give an efficient and useful static analysis of assembly code.

By employing the dynamic programming method, the in-wheel motor actuation torque distributions and optimally-varied vehicle velocity are simultaneously obtained to minimize the EGV energy consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed energy management strategy can greatly reduce the EGV energy consumption and thus maximize its travel distance before a recharging in comparison to a trivial equal-actuation strategy.", "authors": ["Xiaodong Li", "Yan Chen", "Junmin Wang"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1ed3c23a-f61e-455b-8595-f69c1e788dd7", "2861be6d-166d-4787-ac35-847f55b4e075", "6fd95a85-2644-4fb4-ae5e-593db6202fbf", "7ff42d86-fad3-4505-8d37-3c9e1a720f1e", "9d974bfc-36fd-4d32-946f-7bf5fa6c982b", "bae8be4a-2f11-4bed-97ad-e922ab94500c", "c2c3d93a-7d76-44c5-8f35-dd418af5c585", "f63fea7f-0557-406e-a3eb-2be271683ba6", "f678fbf4-2072-4fc0-aae3-1b1448b5a893"], "title": "In-wheel motor electric ground vehicle energy management strategy for maximizing the travel distance", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "8b289023-bd1f-4ccb-84d1-2082d3e12d64"}

This figure increased 508% to 8,070 in 1986\u2014a larger percentage increase than any other major discipline. The 1970s and 1980s have also been an era in which computer science has experienced major theoretical and technological advances. The period has been marked by severe faculty shortages which are only now beginning to ease. Complicating matters further, the discipline is so young that it is still in the process of defining its intellectual framework [3]. Considering all of these factors, it is not surprising that there is a considerable amount of diversity and flux among computer science master's programs.

The available navigation information is an acoustic position measurement and a Doppler log speed measurement. Both measurements are studied in detail and modeled statistically. A kinematic model is assigned to the ROV with its driving noise from a Gaussian mixture, and a particle filter is suggested to estimate ROV position and velocity. The advantages of using a particle filter in this ROV navigation scheme are: 1) to make full use of all available information to improve the estimation performance, such as the speed measurement that is a nonlinear function of the states; 2) the particle filter makes good use of a Gaussian mixture as the driving noise, which makes the ROV kinematic model more realistic in both high and low frequency ranges; 3) a good estimate of the ROV velocity vector is achieved. The algorithm of the particle filter is presented and verified through a simulation based on real data.

{"abstract": "Higher demand for good quality, more reliable and cleaner electrical power has driven the focus towards more robust generation, transmission and distribution framework. It has been envisioned that, a more intelligent grid capable of taking fast and reliable decisions is the need of the hour The Smart Grid. Through intercommunicating devices at every level, the smart grid is expected to take power management to a new level of sophistication and efficiency. The communication network for connecting all these devices is of paramount importance to enable two way information exchange, and reliable and fast automated control. It needs to comply with critical demands of throughput and delay. Use of wireless links is set to be handicapped by ever increasing spectrum scarcity. In order to build up the reliable network, use of Cognitive Radio (CR) provides a feasible solution, by accessing a wider range of spectra through Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA). In this paper we present a CR based Wireless Sensor and Actuator Network (WSAN) model for distribution grid automation. Random appearances of Primary User (PU) have been modeled for DSA implementation. The performance of CR model is compared with legacy Wi-Fi model to evaluate its feasibility for adaptation to the demanding smart grid communication requirements.", "authors": ["Mirza Sami Baig", "Srinit Das", "Pachamuthu Rajalakshmi"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["239a053d-b927-4a2c-8588-3d6c13b2fc84", "510353a5-4acc-4eb0-9ce7-e5b39326dc00", "6a247d2e-5a4f-49ea-815c-bca6e59232c7", "71891347-d90a-47fa-962f-43ffcc5a41f2", "76f06d45-bde4-4aad-b5a1-a64e4c6f308e", "ae2c07fd-413b-4a71-84f1-93ee9c678317", "e13f2ff5-260f-4270-a66f-ab273a6bf582", "f1e74152-3f7c-4c44-b628-cdf47a17587f"], "title": "CR based WSAN for Field Area Network in Smart Grid", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2013, "id": "8bb74fc5-b187-4145-8411-166c1e95d8fc"}

{"abstract": "The participation of individual users in online communities is one of the most noted features in the recent explosive growth of popular online communities ranging from picture and video sharing (Flickr.com and YouTube.com) and collective music recommendation (Last.fm) to news voting (Digg. com) and social bookmarking (del.icio.us). Unlike traditional online communities, these sites feature little message exchange among users. Nevertheless, users' involvement and their contribution through non-message-based interactions have become a major force behind successful online communities. Recognition of this new type of user participation is crucial to understanding the dynamics of online social communities and community monetization.   The new communication features in online communities can be best summarized as Ballot Box Communication (BBC), which is an aggregation mechanism that reflects the common experience and opinions among individuals. By offering a limited number of choices such as voting, rating and tagging, BBC creates a new medium to effectively reveal the interests of mass population (see Table 1). Compared with traditional Computer Mediated Communication (CMC) such as email, Web publishing, and online forums, BBC influences user preferences by simplifying the mass sharing of individual preferences.   These technologies offer new ways for information consumers to be involved in community activities. In traditional online communities, users only have two levels of participation: \"watching from the sidelines\" or \"playing in the game,\" for example, they are either passive readers or active participants in conversations. However, BBC presents a new choice -- \"shouting from the stands\" -- in which each user can express his opinion through BBC and their collective preferences can be heard as a dominant voice. For instance, Digg readers can vote on news and promote it to the front page for millions of visitors to see.   In spite of the increasing significance of non-message-based online communication, very little is known about BBC-enabled communities. As entrepreneurs build and manage new online communities, they have no choice but to look for the \"right\" technologies by trial-and-error. Not surprisingly, the result is hit-or-miss: some of the grandest failures of the dot com bust featured online communities. Only after costly failures, it has been recognized that not all technologies can benefit the growth and sustainability of a community.   Extant theories on online communities and communication networks may offer some guidance on understanding of the emergence of new online communities (such as YouTube). Whitaker et al. identify online communities as \"intense interactions, strong emotional ties and shared activities.\" In addition, Monge and Contractor define communication networks as \"the patterns of contact that are created by the flow of messages among communicators through time and space.\" Both study the social interaction aspect of communities such as user commenting and discussing. However, the nonsocial interaction aspect, which is the focus of BBC and often dominant in contemporary online communities, has not received much attention.", "authors": ["Mu Xia", "Yun Huang", "Wenjing Duan", "Andrew B.

{"abstract": "One of the major concerns for designing VLSI circuits has been the amount of power dissipated by these circuits. Hence, adiabatic techniques such as ECRL and PFAL for low power circuit design came into being. This paper proposes design of basic gates using these two techniques.

{"abstract": "Issue tracking systems play a central role in ongoing software development; they are used by developers to support collaborative bug fixing and the implementation of new features, but they are also used by other stakeholders including managers, QA, and end-users for tasks such as project management, communication and discussion, code reviews, and history tracking. Most such systems are designed around the central metaphor of the \"issue\" (bug, defect, ticket, feature, etc.), yet increasingly this model seems ill fitted to the practical needs of growing software projects; for example, our analysis of interviews with 20 Mozilla developers who use Bugzilla heavily revealed that developers face challenges maintaining a global understanding of the issues they are involved with, and that they desire improved support for situational awareness that is difficult to achieve with current issue management systems. In this paper we motivate the need for personalized issue tracking that is centered around the information needs of individual developers together with improved logistical support for the tasks they perform. We also describe an initial approach to implement such a system \u2014 extending Bugzilla \u2014 that enhances a developer's situational awareness of their working context by providing views that are tailored to specific tasks they frequently perform; we are actively improving this prototype with input from Mozilla developers.", "authors": ["Olga Baysal", "Reid Holmes", "Michael W.

{"abstract": "In recent years, researchers have intensively investigated various topics in test-case prioritization, which aims to re-order test cases to increase the rate of fault detection during regression testing. The total and additional prioritization strategies, which prioritize based on total numbers of elements covered per test, and numbers of additional (not-yet-covered) elements covered per test, are two widely-adopted generic strategies used for such prioritization. This paper proposes a basic model and an extended model that unify the total strategy and the additional strategy. Our models yield a spectrum of generic strategies ranging between the total and additional strategies, depending on a parameter referred to as the p value. We also propose four heuristics to obtain differentiated p values for different methods under test. We performed an empirical study on 19 versions of four Java programs to explore our results. Our results demonstrate that wide ranges of strategies in our basic and extended models with uniform p values can significantly outperform both the total and additional strategies. In addition, our results also demonstrate that using differentiated p values for both the basic and extended models with method coverage can even outperform the additional strategy using statement coverage.", "authors": ["Lingming Zhang", "Dan Hao", "Lu Zhang", "Gregg Rothermel", "Hong Mei"], "n_citation": 69, "references": ["00f2ef8f-2230-4ab0-9cad-5f6f009ace4a", "02e0342a-33d3-4d3f-9f1d-b14081edbc39", "065f1e1d-0aa3-4bbf-9175-3ab19ac598fe", "0bd7b323-b8a6-4324-a5df-436dcf10804b", "0ed73fc7-0a43-4035-baeb-2ae130c184d5", "17df70e7-0407-455e-a2e5-eee26012f400", "1d79213f-ba17-4cb7-90fb-59132ae38391", "1f454005-a014-4688-8ab5-8a735617eb6b", "29392886-b35a-429c-a211-e5dbe9f3d0cf", "32004ab1-98ef-47c0-8cd9-5f2b5daad0e5", "392c42e1-b894-4c08-a2a2-d9f1481c5d3a", "49c8e6b2-7a77-4342-88b6-d7ce11027135", "50ff973a-0fa1-4dde-9d05-3d0737431b69", "53577a95-d855-41b3-9ac2-6287b4f0262b", "58a77f39-fd3c-4379-9f04-5fdac60a736f", "5ca853a0-5405-4126-917b-a17941ee4a08", "6153e1a3-0c17-49d6-bde9-240db2a42c40", "67fdaffd-21ee-439e-b6ac-6142e3386e6d", "86c1046e-96e9-4990-8486-cf3b1f31ca73", "89b78c9b-9dfe-4ba9-84b7-4f49f39576e9", "8ba5783c-0839-4264-acd5-f856ea8cfc20", "bd6a3420-d02e-4d21-a212-0087161afe89", "c51eb132-a39c-4aee-a440-193d712ae5a5", "d1f64331-5040-4415-9934-7ff1b54b9396", "d5a730d1-2b10-4434-a00f-a1a99df4c72d", "e2ec071b-5819-4522-9c78-9c37601fffc6", "e8fa5f96-11a1-4c46-88dc-98bd13872ada", "f5e3e6fa-565f-400d-8895-e1e671628c7c", "f8fbf466-9a15-414a-a900-4a17aac1f106", "fae6805c-b379-4d11-972d-76644b22601c", "fd2ab972-8790-4d67-b1cc-9659a9a67a96"], "title": "Bridging the gap between the total and additional test-case prioritization strategies", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2013, "id": "8bdda8b4-786b-4431-a825-28dd9d7ec0f1"}

{"abstract": "Over the past years, research on specifying, designing and developing secured information systems (IS) has been very active. Some contributions have focused on integrating security aspects, mainly access control mechanisms, at the implementation phase. Others pay a particular attention to the capture and analysis of security requirements. However, to our knowledge, no method addresses the whole problem of the specification of security requirements and their transformation through all the phases of the IS development life cycle. We argue that better Secured IS can be obtained if security issues are taken into account at an earlier phase of the system life cycle and integrated with functional aspects along the whole life cycle. This paper is a step forward to a comprehensive security conceptual meta-model encompassing the main security properties such as availability, integrity, confidentiality, and accountability. It integrates functional and non-functional requirements. It includes social, organizational as well as informational aspects.

{"abstract": "Google App Engine (GAE) is one of the most popular PAAS type cloud platform for database transaction systems. When we plan to run those systems on GAE, performance prediction is one of the obstacles, since only a little performance information on GAE is available. In addition, the structure of GAE is not opened to general public. This paper proposes a Colored Petri Net (CPN) based simulation framework, based on the performance parameters obtained through the measurement by user written programs. The framework is build focusing on the application structure, which consists of a series of GAE APIs, and GAE works as a mechanism to produce the probabilistic process delay. The framework has high modularity to plug-in any kinds of applications easily.", "authors": ["Sachi Nishida", "Yoshiyuki Shinkawa"], "n_citation": 50, "title": "CPN based GAE performance prediction framework", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "8c00cbdf-6b7c-49ba-a7e3-8dfa574a179b"}
{"abstract": "In the mind of the average computer user, the problem of generating uniform variates by computer has been solved long ago. After all, every computer :system offers one or more function(s) to do so. Many software products, like compilers, spreadsheets, statistical or numerical packages, etc. also offer their own. These functions supposedly return numbers that could be used, for all practical purposes, as if they were the values taken by independent random variables, with a uniform distribution between 0 and 1. Many people use them with faith and feel happy with the results. So, why bother?  Other (less naive) people do not feel happy with the results and with good reasons. Despite renewed crusades, blatantly bad generators still abound, especially on microcomputers [55, 69, 85, 90, 100]. Other generators widely used on medium-sized computers are perhaps not so spectacularly bad, but still fail some theoretical and/or empirical statistical tests, and/or generate easily detectable regular patterns [56, 65].  Fortunately, many applications appear quite robust to these defects. But with the rapid increase in desktop computing power, increasingly sophisticated simulation studies are being performed that require more and more \u201crandom\u201d numbers and whose results are more sensitive to the quality of the underlying generator [28, 40, 65, 90]. Sometimes, using a not-so-good generator can give totally misleading results. Perhaps this happens rarely, but can be disastrous in some cases. For that reason, researchers are still actively investigating ways of building generators. The main goal is to design more robust generators without having to pay too much in terms of portability, flexibility, and efficiency. In the following sections, we give a quick overview of the ongoing research. We focus mainly on efficient and recently proposed techniques for generating uniform pseudorandom numbers. Stochastic simulations typically transform such numbers to generate variates according to more complex distributions [13, 25]. Here, \u201cuniform pseudorandom\u201d means that the numbers behave from the outside as if they were the values of i.i.d. random variables, uniformly distributed over some finite set of symbols. This set of symbols is often a set of integers of the form {0, . . . , m - 1} and the symbols are usually transformed by some function into values between 0 and 1, to approximate the U(0, 1) distribution. Other tutorial-like references on uniform variate generation include [13, 23, 52, 54, 65, 84, 89].", "authors": ["Pierre L'Ecuyer"], "n_citation": 319, "references": ["1077d7cc-fd2c-4ce2-98fc-15af1e10035c", "136fa990-dd6a-43c5-a07c-d34007827294", "29c593e2-6811-440d-b195-872b25fe4085", "3332ba3d-68b5-4dea-9b1a-c6c2ddb06c53", "4476738b-6f99-41fc-85f1-f371b1ab348c", "48a829fd-7c8f-4bb7-b481-ae23d55570a2", "56f2637e-65cb-47fe-a568-a4651f23198f", "570da24d-c834-41ee-b1f1-735a89aeedf2", "57c43038-5c59-4feb-99f9-3b5e9d78c4d9", "57c9bc22-64f1-44f5-859f-7a4d40e42293", "5a14cd24-e3ad-4cba-9918-2d4390f35a0b", "5cd88902-4295-4ce8-b141-5ba27848a0e4", "5dfca62b-5d53-4d1e-9a16-9ccc6009af81", "63edf703-cdfd-4c49-bf64-c1c47b146244", "6dccbad7-d7ec-42b2-bbc7-8046469244d2", "6ef0ef9f-0dcd-4ae6-a36e-4f37d2cbb64e", "821ba182-0a01-4473-a61b-95b7d40809be", "8435eaff-0b6f-4300-893d-43a64ad0a411", "ab421de9-79db-4fa2-97a5-f2437bc3cc46", "e0ef0025-9444-4eac-ae3d-1e946ba46c78", "e0f42caa-2022-4a7c-8f2c-3182b3f6d319", "e71f8fa9-6bb9-429c-a53d-d65bef42a568", "ecf3e240-3974-48f8-b634-3478271794c7", "f2aa80ad-e0e0-48b8-bd7c-ca4668cfdfbe"], "title": "Random numbers for simulation", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 1990, "id": "8c0603d4-b6fd-4468-8c1f-7b5e08a0342d"}

{"abstract": "A state observer is proposed for rigid body at- titude motion with a given attitude dynamics model. This observer is designed on the state space of rigid body attitude motion, which is the tangent bundle of the Lie group of rigid body rotations in three dimensions, SO(3), and therefore avoids instability due to the unwinding phenomenon seen with unit quaternion-based attitude observers. In the absence of mea- surement noise and disturbance torques, the observer designed leads to almost global finite-time stable convergence of attitude motion state estimates to the actual states for a rigid body whose inertia is known. Almost global finite-time stability of this observer is shown using a Morse function as part of a Lyapunov analysis; this Morse function has been previously used for almost global asymptotic stabilization of rigid body attitude motion. Numerical simulation results confirm the analytically obtained stability properties of this attitude state observer. Numerical results also show that state estimate errors are bounded in the presence of bounded measurement noise and bounded disturbance torque. I. INTRODUCTION This paper presents a nonlinear observer for attitude and angular velocity states of a rigid body. The attitude dynamics of the rigid body is assumed to be given by Euler's equation with a known external torque, known body inertia, and a bounded but unknown disturbance torque. The observer de- sign presented here exhibits almost global finite-time stable convergence of state estimates to actual states in the absence of measurement noise and disturbance torque. This gives it fast convergence as well as robustness to bounded distur- bance torques and bounded measurement noise. Since most unmanned and manned vehicles can be accurately modeled as rigid bodies, the attitude dynamics of such vehicles when operated in uncertain or poorly known environments, can be subject to unknown but bounded disturbance torques. Therefore, fast convergence of state estimates and robustness of the observer to such unknown disturbances is essential for feedback control of such vehicles. The attitude is described directly on the Lie group of rigid body orientations in this observer design, without using local coordinates or unit quaternions for attitude representation. The attitude and angular velocity observer designed here assumes that attitude and angular velocity have been deter- mined from available measurements. Attitude is determined from direction or angle measurements while angular velocity measurements are usually obtained directly through rate gyros. The problem of attitude determination from a set of three or more vector measurements is commonly set up as", "authors": ["Jan Bohn", "Amit K.

{"abstract": "Testing and demonstrating context aware services can be extremely difficult Context-aware services inherently need information such as the position oftheir users, but it is complicated to gather and supply services with information of that kind. Obviously, one needs to do this when the services are up and running, but it may help to simulate the context information while the services are under development or for demonstration purposes. Even though the simulated context information is not real, the services and the routines that gather and receive the context information can be. This enables systems to be developed with less regard for constraints that stem from using actual sensor technology while also keeping the core functionality of services separate and ready for real-world deployment. One can image two types of simulation tools: those that simulate a set of values as a part of a test suite, and those that allow interactive testing of services in semirealistic circumstances. We have chosen the latter approach because it has the added advantage of allowing us to demonstrate services. QuakeSim is a tool that interactively simulates context information in real time.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a framework for fault-tolerant control of a modernizing electric power grid. The motivation for the new development hinges on the potential benefits of utilizing fast control devices and high sample rate measurement devices to enhance the grid's resilience beyond that offered by the traditional protection devices. A set of quantifiable security indices based on a fault-coverage concept is used for selection of control actions and the times to exert them. Viewed as a discrete state stochastic process, the grid's long-run availability is shown to be an increasing function of the security indices, whereas the security indices are decreasing functions of the level of uncertainty in the grid state information, the the level of imprecision of its dynamic model. An example of an aggregated two-area power system is used to demonstrate the principle and the computation involved in achieving a minimum risk control. It also illustrates how uncertainties cause delay in control actions and reduction in the critical clearance time in order to maintain a prescribed level of security.", "authors": ["N.

{"abstract": "Introduction    A paradox is becoming obvious to both information systems (IS) academics and executives: U.S. demand for IS graduates is increasing, but graduation numbers from university IS programs are flat or in decline. As a result, many CIOs are devoting increasing proportions of their organizations' resources to recruiting IS graduates, through outreach programs to both students and faculty. In spite of these efforts, however, many CIOs report continuing frustrations in attracting enough newly-minted IS talent.   Complicating the picture is a temporal shift in the nature of entry-level IS jobs. Based on a 2006 study that interviewed 104 senior IS managers, skills associated with business domain knowledge, project management, and client-facing tasks (for example, systems analysis and design) are becoming quite important at the entry level. A second study identified a lack of leadership skills and indicated that team work, collaboration, and communication skills need to be enhanced in IS undergraduates. Industry also prefers that academic programs impart this higher level business and leadership knowledge using more experiential learning models. While some level of technical knowledge -- particularly in the areas of programming, architecture/ standards and security -- is still desired, firms are attempting to hire entry-level IS personnel who have been trained in areas that go well beyond the technical.   Jobs previously viewed as entry-level---largely technical and programming-related---are now more likely to be outsourced overseas. An earlier model, in which new hires were expected to spend some time programming while learning the firm's business processes and applications portfolio, is quickly becoming outmoded. Early on, new hires are expected to perform at a higher level of complexity, quickly understanding the business domain and driving projects to completion. Programming and other technical work may well be done in another country.   As the number and nature of IS jobs evolve, the demand and supply curves change. On the demand side, it is expected that the number of IS jobs in non-IS organizations will start growing rapidly due to retirement of the babyboom generation. In fact, the U.S. Department of Labor predicts that growth in occupations such as database administrators, computer software engineers, and systems administrators will be much faster than most other jobs between 2004 and 2014. As IS enrollments have declined over the last five years at most universities, a \"looming shortage\" of IS professionals is on the horizon (See Figure 1).   Unfortunately, many students and parents seem to harbor misperceptions -- sometimes referred to believing in \"myths\" - about the IS discipline, and this may be impacting enrollments. One misperception is related to the state of \"off shoring\"; perhaps relying on media reports, many students and parents have apparently overestimated the impact on U.S.-based IS jobs and salaries. Another misperception appears to be that the IS profession is not an exciting one, and many students and parents seem to equate IS jobs with \"coding.\" Of course, few MIS graduates are actually assigned programming duties, with most focusing instead on tasks such as design and project management.   The supply-demand gap, troubling on its face, may be even more problematic if the IS graduates do not possess the skills that are being demanded by industry. Simply attracting more students will not adequately address all of the looming workforce issues. Thus, IS programs must simultaneously increase their throughput and ensure that they are inculcating a skills set that is of value to employers.   To that end, we have attempted to answer these two questions:   \u2022 How are IS programs evolving to address the changing nature of IS entry level positions?   \u2022 What are IS programs doing to attract more students into the discipline?   To address these two questions, we studied the IS curricula of undergraduate business programs ranked in the Top 50 by the  U.S. News and World Report  in 2006 or 2007. 57 schools appeared in that ranking in either 2006 or 2007; of those 57, 47 offer an undergraduate degree in IS. We contacted all 47 schools with IS programs. At least one senior faculty member or administrator at 32 of these schools participated in a 30 minute, telephone-based structured interview. Interview questions addressed curricular changes within the past five years, curricular changes currently in process, involvement of an advisory board, and marketing.   We now turn to a discussion of the findings from our study.", "authors": ["John H. Benamati", "Zafer D. Ozdemir", "H.

{"abstract": "A series of three laboratory experiments were conducted to assess the influence of graphical and color-enhanced information presentation modes on decision quality, decision making time, use of information, and user perceptions. The experimental design allowed for the unconfounded study of line graphs and color using a variety of information presentation designs for the same decision making task. Based on the findings of these studies, propositions about the impact of graphics and color on individual decision makers are presented. The influence of presentation mode on human performance and the perceived value of information is related to how well it supports the solution approach to a particular task. The benefits of graphics are limited to reducing decision making time but only when the graphical report has been designed to directly assist in solving the task. Multicolor reports aid in decision making, but only in specific circumstances, that is, their benefits are not pervasive. It appears that color is more advantageous when associated with graphical reports, for certain decision maker types, during learning periods, and in time constrained environments.", "authors": ["Izak Benbasat", "Albert S.

{"abstract": "Aiming at the control of a continuously variable hydraulic semi-active damper, in this paper a dynamic feedforward control approach is combined with a feedback component. In order to track reference forces from higher level suspension controllers, in practice, the damper current inputs are mainly calculated by means of static damper characteristics. Thereby, dynamic effects of the damper force generation are neglected. By taking the dynamic damper behavior into account, the model used in the proposed feedforward control component describes the damper behavior considerably better than the state of the art. Moreover, the additional feedback element further improves the precision of the actual provided damping force. The new concept is validated in real-time experiments on a quarter-car test rig for a semi-active suspension system. Using a skyhook law, its performance is analyzed in comparison to the static characteristic-based control. As better force tracking is provided, the proposed model-based strategy is able to improve ride comfort and ride safety simultaneously.", "authors": ["Enrico Pellegrini", "Sebastian Spirk", "Nils Pletschen", "Boris Lohmann"], "n_citation": 1, "references": [], "title": "Experimental validation of a new model-based control strategy for a semi-active suspension system", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "8cdb0dda-6965-4f7d-973f-3c20955b6a57"}

The disadvantage of this approach is, obviously, that the cost associated with implementing usability improvements in a fully implemented system are typically very high and prohibit improvements with architectural impact. In this tutorial, we present the insights gained, techniques developed and lessons learned in the EU-IST project STATUS (SofTware Architectures That supports USability).

{"abstract": "Comparing and contrasting a set of software libraries is useful for reuse related activities such as selecting a library from among several candidates or porting an application from one library to another. The current state of the art in assessing libraries relies on qualitative methods. To reduce costs and/or assess a large collection of libraries, automation is necessary. Although there are tools that help a developer examine an individual library in terms of architecture, style, etc., we know of no tools that help the developer directly compare several libraries. With existing tools, the user must manually integrate the knowledge learned about each library. Automation to help developers directly compare and contrast libraries requires matching of similar components (such as classes and functions) across libraries. This is different than the traditional component retrieval problem in which components are returned that best match a user's query. Rather, we need to find those components that are similar across the libraries under consideration. In this paper, we show how this kind of matching can be done.", "authors": ["Amir Michail", "David Notkin"], "n_citation": 67, "references": ["16d2d9ba-01bc-499c-9466-f14176c66452", "5645c540-1759-441f-849f-aafcc594227e", "65e9d883-cc87-4505-ab64-99a181371d6f", "ad4e5d17-79fe-49c4-82d9-eea9d917d31d", "c1254026-0066-4ea3-a860-35d1b7394602", "ce38a1fc-c0bb-483a-bcbe-13c56d522588", "d74d3622-8232-4873-890b-02bb66fe5e68", "e4866318-8f8b-480a-8c9b-1862b2d0e314", "f65a199c-431a-411e-9e4b-cff188bbaaf2"], "title": "Assessing software libraries by browsing similar classes, functions and relationships", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 1999, "id": "8cf789fb-e948-4dbd-a947-3dc70cd0405f"}
{"abstract": "This paper presents an adaptive controller which maintains consistent ignition timing control of a gasoline homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine with high dilution in the presence of uncertainty or unknown variation in plant parameters such as exhaust runner wall temperature and cylinder charge properties. The control of the combustion timing is based on manipulating the charge temperature through internal dilution, which is achieved by controlling the lift of a secondary opening of the exhaust valve, also known as the rebreathing lift. The adaptive controller is designed based on a simplified bilinear parametric model which contains only the cycle-to-cycle combustion timing dynamics. Implementation of the designed adaptive controller requires feedforward information of the injected fuel and feedback information of the combustion timings when 50% and 90% of energy is released. It is shown through convergence analysis and closed-loop simulation of a full-order engine model that the adaptive controller is able to drive the combustion timing CA 50  to desired set-points by stabilizing the bilinear dynamics when plant parameters are changing.", "authors": ["Chia-Jui Chiang", "Chih-Cheng Chou", "Jian\u2010Hong Lin"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["e6b5ae7e-63c0-4e52-a739-f2434214959c"], "title": "Adaptive control of homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engines", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "8d05c0e7-6ebd-4c1e-b132-fbddb6d7cb8f"}

In this work, project and realization of a full hybrid electric bike (HEB) are presented. The main idea, borrowed from the more explored 4-wheel world, is to use the possible energy fluxes between cyclist and motor in order to improve the efficiency of the primary engine (the human body) being completely self-sustaining and grid-independent (differently to all the other EPACs). Collected biometric data that lead to the algorithm design are presented in detail focusing particularly on human metabolic efficiency measurement.

{"abstract": "While aircraft envelope control has become widespread, vehicle envelope control is still in its infancy. With the ability to estimate sideslip angle and friction coefficient through new methods, stability control systems can assimilate this information for a more complete view of the car's planar dynamics. This paper presents a vehicle envelope controller centered around a computationally simple sliding surface control scheme, in which a cooperative design between the vehicle envelope and the controller mitigates negative aspects of the sliding surface controller while allowing the driver full access to the stable vehicle states. Finally, the sliding surface control scheme is augmented by a proportional control law that eliminates the remaining undesirable effects. The combined control law and envelope are verified with experimental results, using steer-by-wire as a control input.", "authors": ["Carrie G. Bobier", "J.

This allows automatic identification of patterns that are expensive and represent practical optimisation opportunities. To evaluate the practicality of this analysis with a real world large-scale object-oriented application we completed a case study with the developers of letterboxd.com --- a social network website for movie goers.

{"abstract": "Introduction    Tagging, or using keywords to add metadata to shared content, is gaining much popularity in recent years. Tags are used to annotate various types of content, including images, videos, bookmarks, and blogs, through web-based systems such as Flickr, YouTube, del.icio.us, and Technorati, respectively. The popularity of tagging is attributed, at least in part, to the benefits users gain from effective sharing and from organization of very large amounts of information.   As tagging receives increasing attention in both research and business communities, studies have found that users vary substantially in their tag usage, and suggested several factors that motivate user tagging. However, to date no quantitative study has assessed the strength of the effects of each motivation on levels of tag usage. This is surprising, since user participation is critical to the sustainability of content sharing communities, and a collaborative tagging system cannot succeed without higher level of user contribution. In what follows, we address this gap, by studying the strength of relationships between several motivations and users' tagging levels on Flickr, a prominent Web 2.0 photo sharing community.   Currently, there are more than 35 million Flickr users, who have so far uploaded more 3 billion photos. Each Flickr user can upload images and make them viewable by self, by designated friends and family, or by all Flickr users. Flickr users can annotate images with tags - unstructured textual labels; and usually images are tagged only by the user who uploaded them.8 These tags make the images searchable by the uploading user, as well as by others. In addition, each user can designate other users as \"contacts,\" people whose photos the user follows (contacts are often reciprocal).   To understand what underlies tagging, we need to find out what motivates sharing in online environments, and in particular, what motivates tagging. Furthermore, we need to measure the degree to which different motivations affect tagging activity. While some studies has identified individual-level motivations for tagging, other studies have looked solely at the social level, focusing on the social presence as a driver of tagging.", "authors": ["Oded Nov", "Chen Ye"], "n_citation": 82, "references": ["17fbbb03-8b91-4ea6-af29-9fc8fd1f4364", "1a4b7dd6-c11f-4fd1-9454-aeb6f3420d2a", "3639c242-f03d-4c1a-a9e1-20c2d929d284", "4bf6c55f-34b3-4ba9-b8ef-5b63b1800e4d", "a3b13590-9e04-4b69-a909-d81ae5769032", "ac91d9f8-f4c6-485f-80c1-bcf1fd802cb0", "b13e4021-9b29-4cd4-862e-546af213eadd", "b3a9af20-344a-436c-b09d-b4e7ac490fc9"], "title": "Why do people tag?: motivations for photo tagging", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2010, "id": "8e36ab76-9e07-4334-a555-8ea45ec376f9"}

{"abstract": "In current CNC machines, each axis is generally controlled by an individual controller, which tries to minimize the axial position tracking error. However, eliminating the tracking errors of each individual axis in multi-axis feed drive systems may not guarantee the desired contouring accuracy. Tracking errors in individual driving axis result in tool tip contour error and tool orientation contour error during five-axis machining. Based on the conventional definition of the tool orientation contour error, which is defined as deviation in the normal direction from the desired orientation in spherical coordinates, even if the tool tip contour error and tool orientation contour error are very small, a mismatch between the tool tip position and tool orientation causes an overcut or undercut when these errors are treated independently. In order to avoid this mismatch, this paper presents a new definition of the actual tool orientation contour error that considers the synchronization between the tool tip contour error and tool orientation contour error.

{"abstract": "Source code browsing is an important part of program comprehension. Browsers expose semantic and syntactic relationships (such as between object references and definitions) in GUI-accessible forms. These relationships are derived using tools which perform static analysis on the original software documents. Implementing such browsers is tricky. Program comprehension strategies vary, and it is necessary to provide the right browsing support. Analysis tools to derive the relevant cross-reference relationships are often difficult to build. Tools to browse distributed documents require extensive coding for the GUI, as well as for data communications. Therefore, there are powerful motivations for using existing static analysis tools in conjunction with WWW technology to implement browsers for distributed software projects. The CHIME framework provides a flexible, customizable platform for inserting HTML links into software documents using information generated by existing software analysis tools. Using the CHIME specification language, and a simple, retargetable database interface, it is possible to quickly incorporate a range of different link insertion tools for software documents, into an existing, legacy software development environment. This enables tool builders to offer customized browsing support with a well-known GUI. This paper describes the CHIME architecture, and describes our experience with several re-targeting efforts of this system.", "authors": ["Premkumar T. Devanbu", "Yih-Farn Chen", "Emden R.

An analysis of the model's logical and empirical structure reveals a number of problems in its formulation that help to account for the fact that its principal tenets have not been independently validated. The model is shown to be an \u201cevolutionistic\u201d theory within the theories of evolution in the social sciences, focusing on assumed directions of growth and an implied end state toward which growth proceeds, and suffering from problems inherent in such theories.

{"abstract": "In this paper we deal with the solution of very large instances of the design distribution problem for distributed databases. Traditionally the capacity for solving large scale instances of NP-hard problems has been limited by the available computing resources and the efficiency of the solution algorithms. In contrast, in this paper we present a new solution approach that permits to solve larger instances using the same resources. This approach consists of the application of a systematic method for transforming an instance A into a smaller instance A' that has a large representativeness of instance A. For validating our approach we used a mathematical model developed by us, whose solution yields the design of a distributed database that minimizes its communication costs. The tests showed that the solution quality of the transformed instances was on the average 10.51% worse than the optimal solution; however, the size reduction was 97.81% on the average.

The objective of this work is to answer the question:  do systems follow a set of identifiable evolutionary patterns?  In this paper we use software volatility to describe the lifecycle evolution of a portfolio of 23 software systems. We show by example that a vector of software volatility levels can represent lifecycle behavior of a software system. We further demonstrate that the portfolio ' s 23 software volatility vectors can be grouped into four distinguishable patterns. Thus, we show by example that there are different patterns of system lifecycle behavior, i.e. software evolution.", "authors": ["Evelyn J. Barry", "Chris F. Kemerer", "Sandra A.

{"abstract": "Object-oriented techniques promise to improve the software design and programming process by providing an application-oriented view of programming while facilitating modification and reuse. Since the software design crisis is particularly acute in parallel computation, these techniques have stirred the interest of the scientific parallel computing community. Large-scale applications of ever-growing complexity, particularly in the physical sciences and engineering, require parallel processing for efficiency. Since its introduction in the 1970s, Fortran 77 has been the language of choice to model these problems, due to its efficiency, its numerical stability, and the body of existing Fortran codes. However, the introduction of object-oriented languages provides new alternatives for parallel software development. Fortran 90 adds modern extensions (including object-oriented concepts) to the established methods of Fortran 77. Alternatively, object-oriented methodologies can be explored through languages such as C++, Eiffel, Smalltalk, and many others. Our selection among these required a language that was widespread and supported across multiple platforms (particularly supercomputers) with strong compiler optimizations. C++, while not a \u201cpure\u201d object-oriented language, was our choice, since it meets these criteria.", "authors": ["Charles D. Norton", "Boleslaw K. Szymanski", "Viktor K.

{"abstract": "An elementary outline of the theorem-proving approach to automatic program synthesis is given, without dwelling on technical details. The method is illustrated by the automatic construction of both recursive and iterative programs operating on natural numbers, lists, and trees.  In order to construct a program satisfying certain specifications, a theorem induced by those specifications is proved, and the desired program is extracted from the proof. The same technique is applied to transform recursively defined functions into iterative programs, frequently with a major gain in efficiency.  It is emphasized that in order to construct a program with loops or with recursion, the principle of mathematical induction must be applied. The relation between the version of the induction rule used and the form of the program constructed is explored in some detail.", "authors": ["Zohar Manna", "Richard J.

{"abstract": "Recently, there has been extensive research on mobile devices and stream cipher to increase security. The Rabbit stream cipher was selected for the final eSTREAM portfolio organized by EU ECRYPT and as one of algorithms of the ISO/IEC 18033-4 Stream Ciphers on ISO Security Standardization. As the Rabbit evaluated the complexity of side-channel analysis attack as 'medium' in a theoretical approach, the method of correlation power analysis attack and the feasibility of a practical power analysis attack in the experiments are described in this paper. We also propose a countermeasure with random masking and hiding schemes for linear operation. We construct the algorithm of the countermeasure with an additional operating time of 24% with 12.3% increased memory requirements to maintain high-speed performance.

{"abstract": "Software in recent scenario has been highly susceptible to various attacks and threats. Reverse engineering is one of the key technique by which an intruder can understand the inner working of the software. Software protection techniques have be established in order to provide security and authentication to the software. But most of the existing software protection techniques do not provide reliable security against various attacks. Cryptographic approaches are observed to be very efficient in providing security and authentication to the software. Encryption of the code in the software has received much attention in the software engineering domain and various researches are being done in that area. This paper proposes a novel software protection code encryption scheme based on the index table. This approach uses a novel and efficient encryption technique for encryption the indexed table. The encryption technique used is the quasigroup approach which provides least resemblance of the original data when encrypted. The performance of the proposed approach is evaluated based on the time cost and space cost and it is observed that the proposed approach provides significant results and performance.", "authors": ["N.

{"abstract": "Introduction    Global Software Development (GSD) is increasingly becoming the normal practice in the software industry, readily evidenced by U.S. estimates that the value of the offshore software development market has increased 25-fold over the past 10 years, to the extent that one-quarter of U.S. spending on application development, integration and management services is expected to go off-shore according to recent predictions. There are many potential benefits that can arise from GSD. The most frequently cited one is that of reduced development costs due to the salary savings possible. Also, GSD can lead to reduced development duration due to greater time zone effectiveness as companies practice the so-called 'follow-the-sun' software development model. GSD also affords new opportunities for cross-site modularization of development work, potential access to a larger and better-skilled developer pool, and the possibility of greater innovation, learning and transfer of best practices. Finally, GSD can facilitate closer proximity to markets and customers.   However, GSD also introduces a number of challenges in relation to communication, coordination and control of the development process. These arise due to the distances involved in three dimensions -- geographical, temporal, and socio-cultural (See Figure 1). As a consequence, much research and practice has focused on trying to find ways to overcome the GSD challenges identified in Figure 1. In the literature to date, the potential benefits of GSD are usually just mentioned very briefly, if they are mentioned at all, and the realization of these benefits seems to be more or less taken for granted. The primary focus instead is on how the problems inherent in GSD might be addressed. Here, we reverse this trend and focus instead on the benefits and the extent to which they are actually being realized in practice in three global companies practicing GSD.", "authors": ["Eoin \u00d3 Conch\u00fair", "P\u00e4r J. \u00c5gerfalk", "Helena Holmstr\u00f6m Olsson", "Brian Fitzgerald"], "n_citation": 171, "references": ["1707f36d-f496-4dfb-a6f4-7db49d5f94d0", "2a0d5376-b235-49ee-afad-aa1112cd71fc", "5a1d1ae4-b359-45d9-8c21-50cbfa5e2a78", "8eaa9d14-71ff-4cf1-8038-abd9b62f4c6e", "c16c76e5-7c99-4393-8729-1c8afca30d3d", "cd94bee2-2629-44ac-95c0-36dfc640a314", "cecbf5fd-148a-4de9-ae11-b3be17a004d1"], "title": "Global software development: where are the benefits?", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2009, "id": "8f2bfa86-b0c8-4af3-90e1-4365cf82e228"}

{"abstract": "In order to advance software engineering research, agencies should fund pilot studies for calibrating software design productivity impacts of potential technology advances. We need a predictive model of technology impacts in order to advocate technology programs and to select individual projects that provide most benefit to society. Current software cost estimation models can provide a starting point, but in the long run are inadequate because they are based on current methods and technologies for software development. Ultimately, the predictive models need to be rooted in fundamental factors affecting productivity, ranging from cognitive facility of different programming language paradigms, mathematical underpinnings for reuse and compositional approaches, and organizational psychology for large development projects. Such a productivity model would enable development of metrics for individual facets of software design productivity, and an understanding of how even narrow technology advances contribute to overall software design productivity.", "authors": ["Michael R.

{"abstract": "For biological experiments aiming at calibrating models with unknown parameters, a good experimental design is crucial, especially for those subject to various constraints, such as financial limitations, time consumption and physical practicability. In this paper, we discuss a sequential experimental design based on information theory for parameter estimation and apply it to two biological systems. Two specific issues are addressed in the proposed applications, namely the determination of the optimal sampling time and the optimal choice of observable. The optimal design, either sampling time or observable, is achieved by an information-theoretic sensitivity analysis. It is shown that this is equivalent with maximizing the mutual information and contrasted with non-adaptive designs, this information theoretic strategy provides the fastest reduction of uncertainty.", "authors": ["Xiao Lin", "Gabriel Terejanu"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["9fd46124-acfa-4e15-874d-a1d37b5f7114", "cbdad2e1-bd20-44c4-89fe-fa2289724abf", "ec92ecd9-70e1-4aa7-a893-003cd9675e8f"], "title": "Model-Driven Data Collection for Biological Systems", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2014, "id": "8f6ddb38-5aa4-437e-b060-dc3302f1c823"}

{"abstract": "Energy efficiency is a significant area of research in mobile ad hoc networks. The mobile nodes are uncertain and may lead to failure of nodes. The uncertainty of mobile nodes is mainly due to their mobility, draining of battery power and energy consumption. One way of handling this uncertainty is to prevent nodes from failure through the Load Balancing Factor (LBF). This can be achieved by the clustering technique which increases throughput and reduces delay. In this paper, load balancing among clusters is proposed for the AHP-Entropy-TOPSIS based Clustering Protocol (AETCP) to handle uncertain mobile nodes. The AETCP is based on a multicriterion decision-making method which was proposed earlier. The AETCP is the integration of the Analytic Hierarchy Process, Entropy and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution. The predefined energy threshold is applied to the mobile nodes to take part in cluster-head nodes' election using the AETCP. Simulations were carried out by applying the LBF and the predefined energy threshold to the AETCP, and better results achieved in terms of the average cluster size, reaffiliation rate, energy, load balancing factor, throughput and delay.", "authors": ["R.

{"abstract": "The implementation and continuous support of a software product at a customer with evolving requirements is a complex task for a product software vendor. There are many customers for the vendor to serve, all of whom might require their own version or variant of the application. Furthermore, the software application itself will consist of many (software) components that depend on each other to function correctly. On top of that, these components will evolve over time to meet the changing needs of customers. To alleviate this problem we propose to alleviate the software release and deployment effort and reduce risks associated with it. This will be achieved by explicitly managing typical knowledge about the software product, such as configuration and dependency information, thereby allowing software vendors to improve the customer configuration updating process. The proposed solution of knowledge management at both the customer and vendor site, is validated through industrial case studies.", "authors": ["Slinger Jansen"], "n_citation": 1, "references": ["0309c435-090a-4661-82b1-2ef04f26f118", "2e6851b6-05a8-4267-a8d8-3ac4661de7e6", "30d6ff25-514a-44e0-af9d-e5b7db229a3e", "3c06da69-03a4-47b0-9ba3-1b922f14b20f", "4a7429d0-c3f1-44fe-abf3-f9f9e2c9480f", "51eb3a79-972c-40b4-a235-3a31740ef01b", "6b76c163-595b-4dc6-b35e-05ebd2610673", "6dff95ca-7ccc-4de9-a68c-2051ba6fb3fe", "8971d5e3-22dc-441d-9709-1697852dfbd4", "9070b212-d66f-4387-aec3-9c22e949e0f6", "b4233527-ce6c-4ed8-947a-7e46a973eba4", "cb35a63b-eb06-4e08-a84b-021432d33654", "d8404405-078d-4b96-be8c-6f9ae5daedc4", "f61fe4de-5c59-4a30-8831-7b572237caf2"], "title": "Improving the customer configuration update process by explicitly managing software knowledge", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2006, "id": "8f8d1903-9c31-4509-b631-9df61906f70a"}

{"abstract": "Domain-specific languages hold the potential of automating the software development process. Nevertheless, the adoption of a domain-specific language is hindered by the difficulty of transitioning to different language syntax and employing a separate translator in the software build process. We present a methodology that simplifies the development and deployment of small language extensions, in the context of Java. The main language design principle is that of language extension through unobtrusive annotations. The main language implementation idea is to express the language as a generator of customized AspectJ aspects, using our Meta-AspectJ tool. The advantages of the approach are twofold. First, the tool integrates into an existing software application much as a regular API or library, instead of as a language extension. This means that the programmer can remove the language extension at any point and choose to implement the required functionality by hand without needing to rewrite the client code. Second, a mature language implementation is easy to achieve with little effort since AspectJ takes care of the low-level issues of interfacing with the base Java language.", "authors": ["Shan Shan Huang", "Yannis Smaragdakis"], "n_citation": 25, "references": ["ed3d90ed-e8f5-413e-ba63-808be731aefb"], "title": "Easy language extension with meta-aspectJ", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2006, "id": "8fc5be04-7776-4a6a-81d4-9a9ce0e1e8d6"}

{"abstract": "In order to improve the quality of a software system, software defect prediction aims to automatically identify defective software modules for efficient software test. To predict software defect, those classification methods with static code attributes have attracted a great deal of attention. In recent years, machine learning techniques have been applied to defect prediction. Due to the fact that there exists the similarity among different software modules, one software module can be approximately represented by a small proportion of other modules. And the representation coefficients over the pre-defined dictionary, which consists of historical software module data, are generally sparse. In this paper, we propose to use the dictionary learning technique to predict software defect. By using the characteristics of the metrics mined from the open source software, we learn multiple dictionaries (including defective module and defective-free module sub-dictionaries and the total dictionary) and sparse representation coefficients. Moreover, we take the misclassification cost issue into account because the misclassification of defective modules generally incurs much higher risk cost than that of defective-free ones. We thus propose a cost-sensitive discriminative dictionary learning (CDDL) approach for software defect classification and prediction. The widely used datasets from NASA projects are employed as test data to evaluate the performance of all compared methods. Experimental results show that CDDL outperforms several representative state-of-the-art defect prediction methods.", "authors": ["Xiao-Yuan Jing", "Shi Ying", "Zhi-Wu Zhang", "Shan-Shan Wu", "Jin Liu"], "n_citation": 18, "references": ["00f2ca1e-0b3b-45c4-b7b8-d3f182b65012", "012214ad-ce33-4edb-b92b-9c5107196cd6", "02e0342a-33d3-4d3f-9f1d-b14081edbc39", "1dd46ab0-13e9-4cc9-a605-e1a3c81583e4", "21ffae8e-2406-4e5e-b1e1-e6a0f9a82bf1", "380c9c81-58cf-4ca6-ad04-f56e299ca5a3", "38f68332-6bc9-4998-a344-759cfda2fba0", "3a47e149-98d1-4083-8dfd-a45c2b527a6f", "49ef490b-4a92-424d-b64f-ad237cb59247", "4e0d2792-5f82-4e13-812c-781172f92e40", "4ec29d6b-fb27-4bb1-8926-e70de71cbebe", "52fce2c5-8ed5-407a-a2d4-6aecbf84ca50", "5ea14016-59e8-4298-9a1a-c121b915af20", "63320e3d-4a70-4948-bfb7-8c502422a64a", "688d96cf-89c7-4d8f-b882-ae07ded70bbd", "7236dbb7-f0b2-4e28-bb7c-6de187c32d64", "75a60b19-6ae0-435e-a030-694c3b7dc9d8", "76038dc2-5d9e-4d63-9e20-2cd45106cbf1", "7c790617-fc17-43ce-920c-f626acea1330", "7ca35a30-f496-490d-bf55-c3f1abf99178", "84533113-18af-4d21-bc4c-5fa9fd503958", "8641b4ee-59c1-494d-adb3-b6d1919bbbac", "914cbe50-34d2-4648-9676-38e0b448ecf4", "92f40b3b-f8f0-4e02-931d-ad8b0cddba8d", "9605fd6e-63a8-44fd-b9a7-63e6cddf5a30", "a755a7d8-4a2d-49f4-8cb4-c77a1c5d9b88", "aa793d26-18bd-498d-95d6-f61fbba5cf1a", "b47503b8-8e21-4b6b-8e2d-3da52f79fbbb", "b89566a9-a192-4aa4-8338-5dd99f394454", "bb24d529-ae23-4491-bf13-74ba7a116080", "bb3c38fa-c2b0-4d4f-8c9d-ca1884343474", "bc6b7ee6-074d-4c01-bf34-0ac5daf0ffce", "c2fd78d3-f379-421b-a912-c8cf13403933", "cc3f59af-aef1-4a6c-be79-472f7b1dcde0", "cf8ede63-496b-4335-a910-e95dbd0aa70b", "d3f4500c-b3a6-4b21-a469-68a2e20dd416", "d5a44f14-60d8-4dd8-98a2-f805830df6cd", "d5d085fe-d0c9-43b8-82da-ddff89a44367", "da236a5b-d7a4-423c-a344-a5afe9b444a0", "e29d7656-50a5-4821-96a3-1c0c89db07ea", "e4854822-0cec-4aca-934a-50a866c51176", "eaeea321-4362-4084-a0dc-95e949b559be", "eeeeb5ab-ee6b-4eed-ac97-2c8984109e99", "f6b5dc7f-3364-4407-8b8f-c06ce0683635", "f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6", "f6e6c2ed-23a7-4e7d-916c-c48760cc5b18"], "title": "Dictionary learning based software defect prediction", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "8fcd13e5-6517-428b-aa40-d3a35176add8"}

{"abstract": "Accurate battery power capability estimation is a key to battery life and performance in electric and hybrid vehicles. If power capability is predicted to be higher than actual, battery life is reduced and there is potential for vehicle shutdown. If power capability is predicted lower than actual, the customer may experience slower acceleration, lower top speed, and reduced usable electric drive range. In this paper an approach is proposed to estimate lithium-ion battery charge and discharge power capabilities online. First a simplified Randles circuit model is used to represent a battery cell. Then an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is constructed to estimate the model parameters and voltage across the RC network. Algorithms to calculate the charge and discharge power capabilities are presented. Both desktop simulation and pack level vehicle data are shown to support the correctness and accuracy of the proposed algorithms.", "authors": ["R.

{"abstract": "The ACM Committee on Computer Education for Management, supported by a National Science Foundation Grant, is established to appraise the state of the art and to develop a series of recommendations for improving computer education for management. To provide the Committee with material for its study of curricular needs, five regional meetings in the United States were held in 1970, at each of which a broad cross section of invited academicians and practitioners considered the state of curricula in business schools. Three topics were covered: curricula for the general manager; computer-related material in required and functional courses; and curricula for students concentrating on computer-based information systems.  An analysis of the minutes of the meetings revealed a common set of experiences which raised similar pedagogic and economic issues. This presentation gives a summary of the discussions; a condensation of the pedagogic and substantive concerns raised; and consideration of the resource allocation issues involved.  Preliminary to the Committee's recommendations for improving computer education for management, this report has been prepared to provide the participants and the administrators of their institutions with background information for the ongoing task of course development.

{"abstract": "An analog implementation of a damping and tracking control algorithm is presented in this paper. Integral resonant control complemented with a high gain integral action is implemented using analog circuitry. Field programmable analog array (FPAA) is used for implementing the high bandwidth Integral Resonant Control (IRC) scheme while analog integrator is used to implement the high gain integral action on the lateral axis of the high-speed nanopositioner. In this paper, the controller is designed to accommodate systems with time delay arising due to capacitive sensing. The improvement in the lateral scanning bandwidth of a high-speed flexure based scanner for a commercial scanning probe microscope is presented. It is shown that by damping the resonant modes of the lateral axis, the scanning speed can be increased from 65 Hz to 200 Hz. The high gain integral feedback improves the tracking performance of nanopositioner and overcomes the hysteresis. Open loop and closed loop scanning performances are compared up to 200 Hz line rates. Limitations and suggestions for improvement of the nanopositioner performance are discussed.", "authors": ["Sachin P. Wadikhaye", "Bharath Bhikkaji", "S. O.

{"abstract": "In organizations, a gap commonly exists between business goals and business processes. While several approaches provide modeling solutions in each of these two areas, their relationships are often not defined well enough to be used in the software development process. This paper aims to better fill this gap through the introduction of a pattern-based framework that helps construct business processes from organization goals while maintaining traceability relationships between the two. How to extract patterns, which are composed of goal templates, process templates, and their relationships, is briefly presented. The framework, which includes a collection of patterns for a particular domain, is formalized as a profile of the User Requirements Notation, a standard modeling language that supports goals, scenarios, and links between them. A method for the use of such framework is defined and then illustrated through a case study involving an adverse event management system that targets the improvement of patient safety in healthcare organizations.", "authors": ["Saeed Ahmadi Behnam", "Daniel Amyot", "Gunter Mussbacher"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["15a08ea9-a40d-487c-aecc-1b38b39d7e96", "2640e7f3-37cd-4c2f-a11f-0e2ea093d7a0", "44b264bf-39e5-47ac-a2a9-cf2b4d88018b", "46ed8cfc-9750-46a8-8492-e4702c5dfb1b", "59c4a697-9e34-4a9a-99a8-c3b435b3f1f0", "60febb2d-fb11-4b12-9f1c-7fec27a37bb7", "6ca4397f-8d0c-4e7f-ae18-6c6ff5487ff7", "93cb9069-4644-4291-a77d-6cdf1ed9ada9", "c1cb12fa-4652-436f-b1b9-5388560b6edf", "cd863925-8313-4ee0-81f2-9688c2559ee4", "fac86b5d-de78-4185-9f40-b8309796f067", "fb1885b5-8fba-4b7b-aafb-af24a8711fa9"], "title": "Towards a Pattern-Based Framework for Goal-Driven Business Process Modeling", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2010, "id": "9039aed4-d5cb-44b0-b672-f2e8f64f735d"}
{"abstract": "DC Motors have taken a great evolution from older brushed DC motors to today's BLDC motor. It has wide range of applications and hence it needs to have a better lifetime with higher efficiency. So for giving a higher efficiency, better lifetime and to get a better performance Brushless DC motors are developed. This brushless DC motor provides a greater efficiency with its complexity for controlling as a tradeoff, i.e. to get a better efficiency the complexity of the controlling systems increases. The BLDC motor needs the help of sensor to estimate its rotor position details to get controlled by the controlling circuit, which will directly affects the cost of the system. Now the sensorless controlling mechanisms have been developed which have made the cost lesser and provides better stability.

{"abstract": "A plethora of aspect mechanisms exist today. All of these diverse mechanisms integrate concerns into artifacts that exhibit crosscutting structure. What we lack and need is a characterization of the design space that these aspect mechanisms inhabit and a model description of their weaving processes. A good design space representation provides a common framework for understanding and evaluating existing mechanisms. A well-understood model of the weaving process can guide the implementor of new aspect mechanisms. It can guide the designer when mechanisms implementing new kinds of weaving are needed. It can also help teach aspect-oriented programming (AOP). In this paper we present and evaluate such a model of the design space for aspect mechanisms and their weaving processes. We model weaving, at an abstract level, as a concern integration process. We derive a weaving process model (WPM) top-down, differentiating a reactive from a nonreactive process.

{"abstract": "This paper quantifies the transient power losses incurred in re-synchronizing a network of generators and loads. The power system is represented using a network preserving model with loads and asynchronous generators modeled as frequency dependent power injections, which we refer to as 'first-order oscillators'. Coupling these models with the swing equations of traditional generators leads to a mixed-oscillator system. The power flows used to maintain network synchroniza- tion induce resistive (real power) losses in the system, which we quantify through an H2 norm that is shown to scale with network size. Our results also show that given a fixed network size, this H2 norm is the same for first-order, second-order and mixed-oscillator systems, provided that the damping coefficients are all equal. Therefore, if the renewable power generators being added to a power network can be controlled so that their effective dampings match those of the existing generators, they will not increase transient power losses in the system.", "authors": ["Emma Sj\u00f6din", "Dennice F.

Using large and varied datasets stretching over a duration of ten years, we set out to train, test and validate our system in order to either contradict or confirm efficient market hypothesis. Our results reveal a significant improvement over the efficient market hypothesis for majority companies and thus strongly challenge it. Technical parameters and algorithms operating upon them are shown to have a significant impact upon the end-predictive power of the system, thus bolstering claims of their efficacy. Moreover, sentiment analysis results also show a strong correlation with future market trends. Lastly, the superiority of supervised non-shallow learning architectures is illustrated via a comparison of results obtained through a myriad of optimization and clustering algorithms.", "authors": ["Mansoor Ahmed", "Anirudh Sriram", "Sanjay Singh"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["1203b4ec-4c10-4d3c-9050-6f8e8002e5ed", "7565eb7f-f8ff-4cbe-9a11-3556366298ec", "7cbe677b-1c87-442f-9db6-140cde80ed07", "cbc6f809-97b9-4d77-b8a0-3c9efe32c06c"], "title": "Towards a generic framework for short term firm-specific stock forecasting", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2014, "id": "909f8093-eb78-4ce1-8687-df4a0af2fbf3"}

{"abstract": "We provide tight upper and lower bounds, up to a constant factor, for the number of inputs and outputs (I/OS) between internal memory and secondary storage required for five sorting-related problems: sorting, the fast Fourier transform (FFT), permutation networks, permuting, and matrix transposition. The bounds hold both in the worst case and in the average case, and in several situations the constant factors match. Secondary storage is modeled as a magnetic disk capable of transferring P blocks each containing B records in a single time unit; the records in each block must be input from or output to B contiguous locations on the disk. We give two optimal algorithms for the problems, which are variants of merge sorting and distribution sorting. In particular we show for P = 1 that the standard merge sorting algorithm is an optimal external sorting method, up to a constant factor in the number of I/Os. Our sorting algorithms use the same number of I/Os as does the permutation phase of key sorting, except when the internal memory size is extremely small, thus affirming the popular adage that key sorting is not faster. We also give a simpler and more direct derivation of Hong and Kung's lower bound for the FFT for the special case B = P = O(1).", "authors": ["Alok Aggarwal", "S.

The systems considered consists of subsystems interconnected in a graph structure. This graph represents a communication structure of the system and hence governs the structure of the admissible controller, meaning that distributed controllers are considered. The objective of the synthesis is to obtain such admissible controllers that optimize a given performance. The method is scalable with respect to the size of the system and is therefore suitable for large-scale systems. Distributed controllers are suboptimal with respect to centralized ones and it is desirable to measure the amount of performance degradation.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a novel nonlinear control approach for underactuated overhead crane systems, which guarantees both fast trolley positioning and sufficient payload swing eliminating performances. The controller is applicable to both regulation control and trajectory tracking control. Via the utilization of a payload position-like signal, the nonlinear coupling behavior between the actuated trolley horizontal motion and the unactuated payload swing is artificially enhanced. Specifically, by constructing an elegant error signal, the controller is put forward, and the overall crane dynamics is transformed into an interconnected system consisting of two subsystems with respect to (w.r.t.) the constructed error signal and the payload swing, respectively. Subsequently, both subsystems are proven to be input-to-state stable (ISS); by invoking the small gain theorem, we further show that the overall interconnected system is ISS, all of which are supported by Lyapunov techniques. LaSalle's invariance theorem is utilized to prove that the system state is driven to the equilibrium point.

{"abstract": "To suppress two-dimensional load sway caused by the horizontal boom motion of a rotary crane, both horizontal and vertical boom motions are generally used. However, it would be more energy efficient and safer if a control scheme were developed that only used horizontal boom motion, eliminating the need for any vertical boom motion. In addition, if we can suppress load sway without the need to measure it, reduction in the cost of sensors can be achieved. Furthermore, use of simple velocity trajectory patterns such as an S-curve acceleration/deceleration pattern, which are widely used in industrial automation systems, may provide cost-effective implementation of controllers.

{"abstract": "The Network Simulation Testbed (NEST) is a graphical environment for simulation and rapid-prototyping of distributed networked systems and protocols. Designers of distributed networked systems require the ability to study the systems operations under a variety of simulated network scenarios. For example, designers of a routing protocol need to study the steady-state performance features of the mechanism as well as its dynamic response to failure of links or switching nodes. Similarly, designers of a distributed transaction processing system need to study the performance of the system under a variety of load models as well as its response to failure conditions. NEST provides a complete environment for modeling, execution and monitoring of distributed systems of arbitrary complexity.  NEST is embedded within a standard UNIX environment. A user develops a simulation model of a communication network using a set of graphical tools provided by the NEST generic monitor tools. Node functions (e.g., routing protocol) as well as communication link behaviors (e.g., packet loss or delay features) are typically coded by the user in C; in theory, any high-level block-structured language could be supported for this function. These procedures provided by the user are linked with the simulated network model and executed efficiently by the NEST simulation server. The user can reconfigure the simulation scenario either through graphical interaction or under program control. The results of an execution can be graphically monitored through custom monitors, developed using NEST graphical tools.  NEST may thus be used to conduct simulation studies of arbitrary distributed networked systems. However, unlike pure simulation tools, NEST may also be used as an environment for rapid prototyping of distributed systems and protocols. The actual code of the systems developed in this manner can be used at any development stage as the node functions for a simulation. The behavior of the system may be examined under a variety of simulated scenarios. For example, in the development of a routing protocol for a mobile packet radio network, it is possible to examine the speed with which the routing protocol responds to changes in the topology, the probability and expected duration of a routing loop. The actual code of the routing protocol may be embedded as node functions within NEST. The only modifications of the code will involve use of NEST calls upon the simulated network to send, receive or broadcast a message. Thus NEST is particularly useful as a tool to study the performance behavior of real (or realisticly modeled) distributed systems in response to simulated complex dynamical network behaviors. Such dynamic response is typically beyond the scope of analytical techniques restricted to model steady-state equilibrium behaviors.  Traditional approaches to simulation are either language-based or model-based. Language-based approaches (e.g., Simula, Simscript) provide users with specialized programming language constructs to support modeling and simulation. The key advantage of these approaches is their generality of applications. These approaches, however, are fundamentally limited as tools to study complex distributed systems: First, they separate the tasks of modeling and simulation from those of design and development. A designer of a network protocol is required to develop the code in one environment using one language (e.g., C), while simultaneously developing a consistent simulation model (e.g., in Simscript). The distinctions between the simulation model and the actual system may be significant enough to reduce the effectiveness of simulation. This is particularly true for complex systems involving a long design cycle and significant changes. Second, these approaches require the modeler to efficiently manage the complexity of scheduling distributed system models (under arbitrary network scenarios).  Model-based approaches (e.g., queuing-network simulators such as IBM's RESQ [12]) provide users with extensive collections of tools supporting a particular simulation-modeling technique. The key advantage of model-based approaches is the efficiency with which they may handle large-scale simulations by utilizing model-specific techniques (e.g., fast algorithms to solve complex queuing network models). Their key disadvantage is a narrower scope of applications and questions that they may answer. For example, it is not possible within a pure queuing-network model to model and analyze complex transient behaviors (e.g., formation of routing loops in a mobile packet radio network). The model-based approach, like the language-based approaches, suffers from having simulation/testing separated from design/development. It has the additional important disadvantage of requiring users to develop in-depth understanding of the modeling techniques. Designers of distributed database transaction systems are often unfamiliar with queuing models.  NEST pursues a different approach to simulation studies: extending a networked operating system environment to support simulation modeling and efficient execution. This environment-based approach to simulation shares the generality of its modeling power with language-based approaches. NEST may be used to model arbitrary distributed interacting systems. NEST also shares with the language-based approach an internal execution architecture that accomplishes very efficient scheduling of a large number of processes. However, unlike language-based approaches, the user does not need to be concerned with management of complex simulation scheduling problems. Furthermore, NEST does not require the user to master or use a separate simulation language facility; the processes of design, development and simulation are fully integrated. The user can study the behavior of the actual system being developed (at any level of detail) under arbitrary simulated scenarios. The routing protocol designer, for example, can attach the routing protocol designed (actual code with minor adjustments) to a NEST simulation and study the system behavior. As the system changes through the design process, new simulation studies may be conducted by attaching the new code to the same simulation models. NEST can thus be used as an integral part of the design process along with other tools (e.g., for debugging).  In similarity to model-based approaches, NEST is specifically targeted toward a limited scope of applications: distributed networked systems. NEST supports a built-in customizable communication network model. However, this scope has been sufficiently broad to support studies ranging from low-level communication protocols to complex distributed transaction processing systems, avionic systems and even manufacturing processes.  The environment-based approach to simulation offers a few important attractions to users:    1. Simulation is integrated with the range of tools supported by the environment.    The user can utilize graphics, statistical packages, debuggers and other standard tools of choice in the simulation study.    Simulation can become an integral part of a standard development process.     2. Users need not develop extensive new skills or knowledge to pursue simulation studies.    3. Standard features of the environment can be used to enhance the range of applicability.    NEST simulation is configured as a network server with monitors as clients. The client/server model permits multiple remote accesses to a shared testbed. This can be very important in supporting a large-scale multisite project.    In this article we describe the architecture of NEST, illustrate its use, and describe some aspects of NEST implementation. We will also feature its design and provide examples of NEST applications.", "authors": ["Alexander Dupuy", "Jed Schwartz", "Yechiam Yemini", "David F.

{"abstract": "Dynamic languages, such as JavaScript, give programmers the freedom to ignore types, and enable them to write concise code in short time. Despite this freedom, many programs follow implicit type rules, for example, that a function has a particular signature or that a property has a particular type. Violations of such implicit type rules often correlate with problems in the program. This paper presents Type Devil, a mostly dynamic analysis that warns developers about inconsistent types. The key idea is to assign a set of observed types to each variable, property, and function, to merge types based in their structure, and to warn developers about variables, properties, and functions that have inconsistent types. To deal with the pervasiveness of polymorphic behavior in real-world JavaScript programs, we present a set of techniques to remove spurious warnings and to merge related warnings. Applying Type Devil to widely used benchmark suites and real-world web applications reveals 15 problematic type inconsistencies, including correctness problems, performance problems, and dangerous coding practices.", "authors": ["Michael Pradel", "Parker Schuh", "Koushik Sen"], "n_citation": 28, "references": ["029a1e9b-fa5e-4709-9278-6f3ea9e3a9fc", "048ad9e5-0cf6-4c62-a085-cb63a63c2000", "0c447e07-e1d4-47a2-ba2b-6ba4d02e017c", "0f371f2f-ee51-44b6-b83c-885c66b7c6ae", "2ed548cc-a319-474e-b235-3991ae1a06a9", "3bf4c152-6e00-4fb0-b61c-8dc7db33dade", "3d100a72-9e26-4da7-81e0-efe03a94dd39", "41215425-d90a-4edb-b181-fcc672fc62e6", "4647bb7d-534c-4250-8c5b-c5d359fc7394", "5a1c71de-8cc2-4b76-8c60-8a9d9f4dfb99", "6137dfb6-d80c-4b85-9622-c1f48842c1ae", "6463cd03-0aa4-4dd6-b28c-8ec329cf2491", "66f8529a-a607-48e4-aaf5-002db75a9b20", "68115839-f44d-4655-bde6-775e57a86791", "6be6141c-2f87-4bfe-91e0-c25eac475a8d", "6db05ba2-87fb-4ffe-b563-c8d871d8e613", "76d9cce3-6d3f-4cc3-b623-d1c54d7d1eed", "7f660026-0244-49dc-b719-cc778c09e003", "807f69ea-8506-40ec-80af-9f1eb253860c", "82a842cc-8e69-4fd1-86d6-d319410e2932", "854f5c9f-db4c-4634-95c1-4ba2397da0ea", "886e2160-0b42-43d9-8f60-7f15fa6c80e1", "89a9b46a-7807-4b23-bccd-c18c3e0d4b87", "8dc294cf-1d89-428c-ace5-410fd5d8ec0a", "9bac6c52-4080-4e1e-b9db-959502ab93d4", "9c3794c6-d8eb-40f3-97a0-1aa6989049b1", "9e0c8d20-5181-4100-bee0-91b5f0ea9f6f", "a8c447f0-f31e-4268-a057-71c6017cd302", "afe1eec0-73c3-4a1a-bf01-1a89798e7d90", "b0b2f3b0-fcd4-4c1c-890a-ff2c219e5573", "b637dc4e-2a7c-4390-bc6c-daa285d63e8d", "c0cd9d8b-354f-4f56-a03f-0099397a45d4", "ca6ed2bc-fbe4-4a54-a79f-d8d2220d68b4", "dcdf965f-d02c-41ba-8f44-a325ab01965c", "deab4263-07ac-49ef-88b2-3e667146ecec", "e8a48be6-2e41-4977-86f0-625f991ba421", "fe0623a1-45fe-48c6-b0b7-9a2ad8313a53"], "title": "TypeDevil: dynamic type inconsistency analysis for JavaScript", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "914b8660-033f-45f1-a7e3-f4798faccb25"}

{"abstract": "Bug localization refers to the process of identifying source code files that contain defects from descriptions of these defects which are typically contained in bug reports. There have been many bug localization techniques proposed in the literature. However, often it is hard to compare these techniques since different evaluation datasets are used. At times the datasets are not made publicly available and thus it is difficult to reproduce reported results. Furthermore, some techniques are only evaluated on small datasets and thus it is not clear whether the results are generalizable. Thus, there is a need for a platform that allows various techniques to be compared with one another on a common pool containing a large number of bug reports with known defective source code files. In this paper, we address this need by proposing our Bug lOcalization experimental plATform (BOAT). BOAT is an extensible web application that contains thousands of bug reports with known defective source code files. Researchers can create accounts in BOAT, upload executables of their bug localization techniques, and see how these techniques perform in comparison with techniques uploaded by other researchers, with respect to some standard evaluation measures. BOAT is already preloaded with several bug localization techniques and thus researchers can directly compare their newly proposed techniques against these existing techniques. BOAT has been made available online since October 2013, and researchers could access the platform at: http://www.vlis.zju.edu.cn/blp.", "authors": ["Xinyu Wang", "David Lo", "Xin Xia", "Xingen Wang", "Pavneet Singh Kochhar", "Yuan Tian", "Xiaohu Yang", "Shanping Li", "Jianling Sun", "Bo Zhou"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["015144cf-6836-40be-9bb6-741211a00d4b", "30d4f0ad-89c2-4c3e-8330-295a5cc80502", "46925b7f-d9a9-400a-a88d-7aa45706c725", "6aec772b-ed45-4adc-b53f-c3dba2be760e", "92b2e4a7-52bc-4e95-af3d-c624af0a962c", "e0783c00-90b9-4849-a650-114ffb62cf17", "f4b437b8-fff2-4419-95f6-ff73b2fd72a5", "ffcf3d51-ef21-4f9e-bd08-82ff98fa1c15"], "title": "BOAT: an experimental platform for researchers to comparatively and reproducibly evaluate bug localization techniques", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "915703ad-f011-4a22-ba14-a764a2389f18"}

{"abstract": "In typical adaptive control using fuzzy function approximators, the centers of the decoding membership functions become adaptive parameters. As with any direct adaptive control, drift of adaptive parameters to large magnitudes can eventually lead to bursting behavior. Previous methods proposed for robust training utilize a mathematical modification of the update law, and may sacrifice significant performance to eliminate the risk of bursting. This paper proposes taking advantage of the local nature of fuzzy membership functions to design an introspective algorithm. At the moment the trajectory leaves a domain, the algorithm decides whether to keep the Lyapunov-stable adaptive update made during the domain activation, or discard it (depending on whether the error was decreased over the domain or not).

{"abstract": "In this paper, we address an unfairness problem that exists among vehicles of distinct mean velocities in a Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) network used for drive-thru Internet applications. A vehicle moving with higher velocity has less chance to communicate with the Road Side Unit (RSU), as compared to the slow moving vehicle, due to its shorter residence time in the coverage area of RSU. Accordingly, the data transfer of a higher velocity vehicle gets degraded significantly, as compared to that of the vehicle with lower velocity, resulting in unfairness among them. In this paper, our aim is to resolve this unfairness problem by assigning Transmission Opportunity (TXOP) limits according to vehicle's mean velocity. Using an analytical model, we prove that tuning TXOP limit proportional to mean velocity can ensure fairness among vehicles belonging to distinct classes of mean velocities, in the sense of equal chance of communicating with RSU. Analytical results are validated using extensive simulations.", "authors": ["V. P. Harigovindan", "A. V.

{"abstract": "Data sets contain very large amount of information, which is not an easy task for the users to scan the entire data set. The researcher's initial task is to formulate a realistic explanation for the use of sampling in his research. Sampling has been often suggested as an effective tool to reduce the size of the dataset operated at some cost to accuracy. It is the the process of selecting a representative part of a data set for the purpose of determining parameters or characteristics of the whole data set. Due to sampling we overcome the problems like; i) in research it is not possible to collect and test each and every element from the data base individually; and ii) study of sample rather than the entire dataset is also sometimes likely to produce more reliable results. This paper focuses on different types of sampling strategies applied on hybrid higher order neural network classifier (HHONC) rather than artificial neural network which is having several limitations. To overcome such limitations HHONC have been used. Here sampling technique has been applied on four real, integers and categorical dataset such as breast cancer, pima Indian diabetes, leukaemia and lung cancer data set prior to classification. The main objective of this paper is an empirical comparison of different sampling strategies for classification which gives more accuracy.", "authors": ["Prem Pujari Pati", "Kaberi Das", "Debahuti Mishra", "Shruti Mishra", "Lipismita Panigrahi"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["7ed8784e-83cd-4c08-baaa-af8091d9e876", "d2b930b0-9a01-4557-8482-bb72ec28f0fb", "d6f660eb-2c47-4de1-ba58-3783878e401f", "e6fe2321-f88c-4f5c-ba46-ef4e00a3d895"], "title": "Sampling correctly for improving classification accuracy: a hybrid higher order neural classifier (HHONC) approach", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "923aaf7a-ff9f-4d2d-85ff-437cb78093a5"}

The experiment itself involved redesigning and reimplementing portions of an existing communication system. The paper compares the project team's design, based on traditional top-down structured design methods, with an alternative design based on information hiding.   The project was intended to monitor how a typical industrial software team might adapt to using Ada on realistic embedded application projects. Just as important, however, were the insights gained on how to use Ada in system design.   Although the team used virtually every novel feature of Ada, they produced a design remarkably similar to that produced by the original implementors of the system, who used Fortran and Assembler.

The swarm formation is maintained through artificial potential together with fuzzy sliding mode control (FSMC). The fuzzy parameters associated with the FSMC are estimated using an adaptive algorithm derived using Lyapunov stability theory. The adaptive FSMC thus proposed is intended to compensate for the modeling uncertainties existing in practical applications. It is shown that the proposed FSMC is able to avoid the chattering phenomenon completely as observed in conventional sliding mode control and hence the center of the swarm will become stationary.

{"abstract": "Properties of the thermoforming process, such as its nonlinear, time-varying dynamics and actuator constraints, make its control challenging. An iterative control technique along with model predictive control (MPC) is presented in this paper on 2D control of the thermoforming process. This approach utilizes not only incoming information from the ongoing cycle, but also the information stored from the past cycles. To deal with constraints as well as non-repetitive disturbances in the process, the MPC technique is incorporated to update the control law within the cycle. To exploit the repetitive nature of the heating phase of the process, a cycle-to-cycle iterative learning control technique direction is proposed. The iterative learning strategy is useful for achieving desired temperature despite model mismatch and disturbances. Even though the proposed multi-zone temperature controller can handle a multivariable process, the large number of computations makes it difficult to apply to large systems such as a thermoforming machine. To reduce the computational burden, the control laws are computed offline using multi-parametric programming.", "authors": ["Md.

{"abstract": "A design pattern documents a reference design for the solution to a recurring problem encountered in object-oriented software development. The fundamental theme of design patterns is to encapsulate the concepts that vary. Software practitioners generally take it for granted that achieving the pattern theme would lead to extensible software. Is such a conjecture legitimate? A direct validation of the conjecture is difficult because it requires an objective measurement of extensibility, which is still an open controversial concept. In this paper, we examine the conjecture indirectly by exploring if there is any relation between the pattern theme and the Open-Closed Principle, which has been advocated by many to achieve extensible object-oriented software. We conducted an experiment based on 98 postgraduate students in a software engineering course. The experiment suggested that the satisfaction of the pattern theme generally lead to the conformance to the Open-Closed principle. However, three exception cases were found. We look into these few exceptions and provide some analyses.", "authors": ["T.H.

{"abstract": "Systematic reuse of large-scale software components promises rapid, low cost development of high-quality software through the straightforward integration of existing software assets. To date this promise remains largely unrealized, owing to technical, managerial, cultural, and legal barriers, One important technical barrier is architectural mismatch. Recently, several component integration architectures have been developed that purport to promote large-scale reuse. Microsoft's OLE technology and associated applications are representative of this trend. To understand the potential of these architectures to enable large-scale reuse, we evaluated OLE by using it to develop a novel fault-tree analysis tool. Although difficulties remain, the approach appears to overcome architectural impediments that have hindered some previous large-scale reuse attempts, to be practical for use in many domains, and to represent significant progress towards realizing the promise of barge-scale systematic reuse.", "authors": ["Kevin J.

The acceptance of such a system depends to a large degree on the quality of its user interface. Prototyping is an excellent means for generating ideas about how a user interface can be designed, and it helps to evaluate the quality of a solution at an early stage. We present the basic concepts behind user interface prototyping, a classification of tools supporting it and a case study of nine major industrial projects. Based on our analysis of these projects we present the following conclusions: prototyping is used more consciously than in recent years. No project applied a traditional life-cycle approach, which is one of the reasons why most of them were successful.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a method to design an optimal dynamic contract between a principal and an agent, who has the authority to control both the principal's revenue and an engineered system. The key characteristic of our problem setting is that the principal has very limited information: the principal has no capability to monitor the agent's control or the state of the engineered system. The agent has perfect observations. With this asymmetry of information, we show that the principal can induce the agent to control both the revenue and the system processes in a way that maximizes the principal's utility, if the principal offers appropriate real-time and end-time compensation. We reformulate the dynamic contract design problem as a stochastic optimal control of both the engineered system and the agent's future expected payoff, which can be numerically solved using an associated Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation. The performance and usefulness of the proposed contract are demonstrated with an indirect load control problem.", "authors": ["Insoon Yang", "Duncan S. Callaway", "Claire J.

A second example then describes how using the most frequently entered state as the regenerative state reduces the chance of making a costly error in a preliminary simulation run.

{"abstract": "A recently introduced technique called Advanced Disturbance Rejection Control (ADRC) lays out the principles of designing controllers for nonlinear systems without explicitly knowing the system model. In this paper, we study ADRC in the presence of a single output measurement delay, which may destabilize the observer segment of the ADRC and in turn destabilize the overall nonlinear system. We develop tools to select the controller gains of this observer, which concerns the linear control design, so that the observer can be made asymptotically stable for a range of delays including the output delay. A case study is presented to demonstrate the control implementation on a nonlinear system.", "authors": ["Rifat Sipahi"], "n_citation": 3, "references": ["0dcb2c37-a47f-490c-ae9b-e2738bda93c6", "113efe85-9386-4899-8aa3-9fd3f1f30bc7", "45e695fd-fbe0-4d5c-a65a-902d09bfac9b", "4acdb4cb-f921-4b79-9dd4-dfcde601dc3e", "852a57ad-5cd4-40f1-b25f-870b17ef897c", "8c36c440-4f0b-4d26-9157-fa32eeb326f2", "ca50486b-2d4a-4d4c-af15-404857dac5e1", "dcf0f3c4-70f1-4c28-9c96-76a8cdd51094", "f0cd3b82-8b3a-41a3-90d1-5490ae9c40af", "f71ea588-f5cf-4690-999a-41b8f84c7046", "f8a4ba28-c6a1-42e3-a961-e14d70ba8fa0", "f8ca1757-78b4-463f-8716-da3e315cf896"], "title": "Model-free approach to controlling nonlinear systems with single output delay", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "9371d18b-0af1-48a2-a15b-2f2a9927c12b"}
{"abstract": "The state of object-oriented is evolving rapidly. This survey describes what are currently thought to be the key ideas. Although it is necessarily incomplete, it contains both academic and industrial efforts and describes work in both the United States and Europe. It ignores well-known ideas, like that of Coad and Meyer [34], in favor of less widely known projects.  Research in object-oriented design can be divided many ways. Some research is focused on describing a design process. Some is focused on finding rules for good designs. A third approach is to build tools to support design. Most of the research described in this article does all three.  We first present work from Alan Snyder at Hewlett-Packard on developing a common framework for object-oriented terminology. The goal of this effort is to develop and communicate a corporate-wide common language for specifying and communicating about objects.  We next look into the research activity at Hewlett-Packard, led by Dennis de Champeaux. De Champeaux is developing a model for object-based analysis. His current research focuses on the use of a trigger-based model for inter-object communications and development of a top-down approach to analysis using ensembles.  We then survey two research activities that prescribe the design process. Rebecca Wirfs-Brock from Tektronix has been developing an object-oriented design method that focuses on object responsibilities and collaborations. The method includes graphical tools for improving encapsulation and understanding patterns of object communication. Trygve Reenskaug at the Center for Industriforskning in Oslo, Norway has been developing an object-oriented design method that focuses on roles, synthesis, and structuring. The method, called Object-Oriented Role Analysis, Syntheses and Structuring, is based on first modeling small sub-problems, and then combining small models into larger ones in a controlled manner using both inheritance (synthesis) and run-time binding (structuring).  We then present investigations by Ralph Johnson at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign into object-oriented frameworks and the reuse of large-scale designs. A framework is a high-level design or application architecture and consists of a suite of classes that are specifically designed to be refined and used as a group. Past work has focused on describing frameworks and how they are developed. Current work includes the design of tools to make it easier to design frameworks.  Finally, we present some results from the research group in object-oriented software engineering at Northeastern University, led by Karl Lieberherr. They have been working on object-oriented Computer Assisted Software Engineering (CASE) technology, called the Demeterm system, which generates language-specific class definitions from language-independent class dictionaries. The Demeter system include tools for checking design rules and for implementing a design.", "authors": ["Rebecca Wirfs-Brock", "Ralph E.

{"abstract": "During the past few years, advances in hardware technology have significantly changed the nature of software development. In the 1970's, the model of software development environments changed from batch processing to time sharing, with all software developers connected to the time-sharing system via terminals.  This model of computing has changed in the 1980's from time sharing to distributed processing. Software developers now have their own personal computers, which is connected to other computers over a local area network. Leading software engineering organizations have developed computing environments based around engineering workstations, such as those manufactured by Sun Microsystems, Apollo Computer, Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, and others, the current estimate is that approximately 50,000 such workstations are being used for software development, and this number is growing rapidly.  These software development environments are based upon a distributed network of workstations, connected by a local area network, such as an Ethernet or DECnet. Individual workstations may be \u201cdiskfull\u201d or diskless, with one or more workstations acting as file servers, where a distributed file system, such as NFS or RFS, provides all users will access to files. Once the system is configured, the combination of the local area network and the distributed file system supports file location transparency.  These workstations support windowing systems as well, allowing users to have several active windows concurrently performing tasks. New window systems, such as MIT's X Windows and Sun's NeWS, support host/client processing, so that windows on the client machine can be used to execute window-based applications on the host. The combination of the local area network with the distributed window system supports \u201cexecution transparency,\u201d so that the user need not be aware of the processor on which a task is executed, as long as all of the resources needed for execution of the task are available. Of course, the distributed file system is an essential part of the necessary support for execution transparency.   As this model evolves, the computing environment will grow in terms of the number of users on the network, the volume of traffic on the local area network, and the volume of data to be stored. Advances in hardware technology are needed to support the evolution of this model of computing.  This panel session addresses some of these requirements for future distributed software development environments. Among the topics to be discussed are:   What are the price/performance characteristics of future workstations?    Where will today's personal computers, such as the IBM PC and the Macintosh, fit into this computing environment?    What are the expected uses of increased workstation computing power?    What are the limitations of current local area network technology?    What are the characteristics of emerging high performance local area networks?    How can optical disk technology be used in computing environments?    What are the implications of distributed window systems and distributed file systems for future distributed computing environments?    What are the expected costs and benefits for software development organizations?     Anthony West of Sun Microsystems, Inc., will discuss aspects of future workstations, including Sun's high performance processor work and their SPARC architecture. Such processors already provide 7 MIPS of desktop computing power, figure that will increase sharply in the next few years.  W.R. Franta of Network Systems, Inc., will discuss the Ethernet and its successors, including emerging technology that offers a bandwidth that is 100 times greater than that available with the Ethernet.  Koichi Ogawa of Fujitsu Laboratories will discuss optical disk systems and their use for mass storage. The panel will then discuss the ways in which such mass storage can be used in a distributed software development environment.", "authors": ["Anthony I.

{"abstract": "In this paper, novel decentralized controllers are introduced for a class of nonlinear interconnected discrete-time systems in an affine form with unknown internal subsystem and interconnection dynamics. First under the assumption that the state vector of the local subsystem is only measurable, a single neural network (NN)-based decentralized tracking controller is introduced to overcome the unknown internal dynamics as well as the control gain matrix of each subsystem. The NN weights are tuned online by using a novel update law, and thus, no offline training is employed. By using Lyapunov techniques, all subsystems signals are shown to be uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB). Next, the tracking problem is considered by using output feedback via a nonlinear NN observer. Lyapunov techniques demonstrate that the subsystems states, NN weight estimation errors, and state estimation errors are all UUB. Simulation results are provided on interconnected nonlinear discrete-time systems in affine form and on a power system with excitation control to show the effectiveness of the approach.", "authors": ["Shahab Mehraeen", "Sarangapani Jagannathan"], "n_citation": 2, "references": ["120d58bb-bc99-41d9-aa24-a57292e8fa03", "1d0377aa-626a-4a2b-aa80-91f3f06e136e", "2c2e00b0-2265-4374-9af0-274bfac5018b", "80b281f7-8f1e-4f14-9672-0abef23a0b55", "af5d94c7-3313-4429-937e-9fb26965433f", "d9845ec6-1bac-46a3-8bdb-3f38b9830543"], "title": "Decentralized adaptive neural network state and output feedback control of a class of interconnected nonlinear discrete-time systems", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "9380b2e3-f55e-4a46-8cbd-0c39a0142820"}

{"abstract": "This paper examines critically, with a view to stimulating a discussion, some concepts which have been used in early work on software reliability measurement, and suggests improvements and areas of potentially fruitful future research. It is proposed that hardware-motivated measures such as mttf, mtbf should not be used for software without justification, and it is shown that such justification may be lacking under quite unexceptionable circumstances. Alternative methods of measuring software reliability are proposed. Emphasis is placed upon differentiating between two concepts of software reliability which are often blurred in the work of previous authors. These are, on the one hand, the reliability of the program-as-it-is (the number of bugs it contains), on the other, the reliability of the program-as-it-performs (failure rate, distribution of time to next failure, etc.). It is argued that the latter, here called  operational reliability , is the one we should use. Measures of operational reliability which avoid use of mttf, etc., are proposed. A case is made for software engineers adopting a Bayesian stand-point:both in the interpretation of probability statements and in inference procedures. It is suggested that reliability modelling solely in terms of failures (or number of bugs) is unnecessarily naive. Interest really centres upon the  consequences  of failures as much as on their frequency. It is proposed that more effort be devoted to the development of models which incorporate a cost (or utility) structure. Finally, brief consideration is given to the question of program structure. The enormous success of hardware reliability theory, in combining component reliabilities with knowledge of system sturcture, must be emulated for software. Unfortunately, software structure does not easily lend itself to such an exercise. Some existing models are considered.", "authors": ["Bev Littlewood"], "n_citation": 143, "references": ["04ebdff8-1493-4a40-b8ba-1c83d5d64275"], "title": "How to measure software reliability, and how not to", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 1978, "id": "938822ba-6b04-4a9a-b7f9-7843ccf3ef81"}

{"abstract": "SCOPE is adopted by thousands of developers from tens of different product teams in Microsoft Bing for daily web-scale data processing, including index building, search ranking and advertisement display. A SCOPE job is composed of declarative SQL-like queries and imperative C# user-defined functions (UDFs), which are executed in pipeline by thousands of machines. There are tens of thousands of SCOPE jobs executed on Microsoft clusters per day, while some of them fail after a long execution time and thus waste tremendous resources. Reducing SCOPE failures would save significant resources. This paper presents a comprehensive characteristic study on 200 SCOPE failures/fixes and 50 SCOPE failures with debugging statistics from Microsoft Bing, investigating not only major failure types, failure sources, and fixes, but also current debugging practice. Our major findings include (1) most of the failures (84.5%) are caused by defects in data processing rather than defects in code logic; (2) table-level failures (22.5%) are mainly caused by programmers mistakes and frequent data schema changes while row-level failures (62%) are mainly caused by exceptional data; (3) 93.0% fixes do not change data processing logic; (4) there are 8.0% failures with root cause not at the failure-exposing stage, making current debugging practice insufficient in this case.

{"abstract": "We present a controlled experiment for the empirical evaluation of Example-Driven Modeling (EDM), an approach that systematically uses examples for model comprehension and domain knowledge transfer. We conducted the experiment with 26 graduate and undergraduate students from electrical and computer engineering (ECE), computer science (CS), and software engineering (SE) programs at the University of Waterloo. The experiment involves a domain model, with UML class diagrams representing the domain abstractions and UML object diagrams representing examples of using these abstractions. The goal is to provide empirical evidence of the effects of suitable examples in model comprehension, compared to having model abstractions only, by having the participants perform model comprehension tasks. Our results show that EDM is superior to having model abstractions only, with an improvement of 39% for diagram completeness, 30% for questions completeness, 71% for efficiency, and a reduction of 80% for the number of mistakes. We provide qualitative results showing that participants receiving model abstractions augmented with examples experienced lower perceived difficulty in performing the comprehension tasks, higher perceived confidence in their tasks' solutions, and asked fewer clarifying domain questions, a reduction of 90%. We also present participants' feedback regarding the usefulness of the provided examples, their number and types, as well as, the use of partial examples.", "authors": ["Dina Zayan", "Michal Antkiewicz", "Krzysztof Czarnecki"], "n_citation": 11, "references": ["0fd6f122-59f1-4386-8c79-a2b7fbbd18df", "181d554b-0318-45d8-8b95-46873051a1c8", "22dbd702-ca31-406c-8b93-68325a3d826c", "414307a7-3e20-4f32-a2ea-c62cf53e4649", "5416affd-bcfd-4045-81e1-35f4513f445a", "589167e8-2d00-4a84-b4c0-74171535398c", "70cc1767-f2a9-49eb-9b98-deafff430fd5", "8ef3b696-006b-4755-a38a-98ec7f207f22", "93334d60-a136-4b20-8fce-63f04f7ca515", "9e8d87df-f0d8-4465-b63a-b3d892c336b4", "9fa0c420-b393-43c2-bbb4-5278dcdd8e0e", "a852396f-4801-430d-9f22-e307baea9627", "bcfb3469-9558-42cc-8007-c94eb27dad80", "c077971e-c43f-462f-accb-7a2a86a5d176", "c0ee6e8f-fdfd-4f42-87f7-1500f83ad45f", "c0f9d991-349e-45d1-b500-aa20e23fb1a4", "e3ca3686-b725-4f9e-b82d-4e7006c40fc4", "ed4cb40e-4ecb-4b66-80fc-675970db777d", "f0c3a0bc-beb4-4ae9-99bb-327fe0cf8b3a"], "title": "Effects of using examples on structural model comprehension: a controlled experiment", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "93ff1980-2c91-4cb6-b117-6e65b9754746"}

{"abstract": "The mobile Internet, defined as wireless access to the digitized contents of the Internet via mobile devices, has advanced significantly, both in terms of its user population and its technology. Recent research suggests that the number of mobile Internet users in the world will grow 18-fold between 2000 and 2005, to about 729 million [5]. The number of people using the mobile Internet already exceeds those using the stationary Internet in Japan [3]. In South Korea, the number of people owning a mobile phone is 29 million (64% of the total population), the number of mobile Internet subscribers is estimated to be about 18 million (39% of the total population), and more than 3.5 million people are already using a 2.5G mobile Internet service, CDMA-1x, with a speed of 2.4Mbps [8]. The rapid growth of the mobile Internet has significant implications for e-businesses. However, we cannot simply transfer the rules of the stationary Internet to the mobile Internet \u201cgame\u201d because the mobile Internet differs significantly in various aspects from the stationary Internet. Hence we need to analyze the characteristics of the mobile Internet and their impact on e-business. This study investigates the business implications of the mobile Internet from the user\u2019s perspective. In three consecutive large-scale surveys conducted in Korea, the effects of the characteristics of the mobile Internet on business users were identified. The business implications of the mobile Internet were then compared with those of the stationary Internet, and their divergences analyzed according to the characteristics of mobile Internet systems.", "authors": ["Minhee Chae", "Jinwoo Kim"], "n_citation": 154, "references": ["8c650936-63ad-4763-9df2-750e154e4668", "c019c399-5de9-4a80-aea2-63a65df26dec", "f9e5f4c7-a5e2-4d07-a61b-851cabd01e26"], "title": "What's so different about the mobile Internet?", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 2003, "id": "9481f9da-060a-4361-aba4-d1ccbca4488c"}

With smart phones, tablet computers, and embedded sensors/actuators flourishing, users are already interacting with dozens of computers per day. A large body of research has addressed many issues in hardware and software for the future, but few have focused on the users. We posit that the reason ubiquitous computing environments are still largely unrealized is because research is technology-centric, with inadequate focus on users. To bridge this gap between what technology can provide and what users need and want from ubiquitous computing, we motivate the need for end-user programming in ubiquitous computing environments and provide a vision for enabling end-user programming. We believe that the software engineering community must provide end-user programming capabilities in ubiquitous computing environments if this domain is to reach its full potential.", "authors": ["Seth Holloway", "Christine Julien"], "n_citation": 29, "references": ["0c01d08a-8c3f-4a1e-b2ee-737545d971a0", "1eeaa176-5f72-4ccd-9339-67de873576f8", "2318dd4a-3bdf-4edd-a0da-475b1bd68651", "3e9b647b-2cb5-4799-9ead-e1c98c4e6a21", "4cc62b62-1e02-47fb-84d6-bf30af66e872", "5339edf7-89eb-4d98-82ae-ecbea9616863", "6d8e0353-94b7-4ecb-9a52-26f076350ee6", "788e6215-0da0-41ab-bc17-7d0e0e8092bf", "79193c42-bfb2-48c1-8725-754e2bb683ff", "7dd6c17e-35df-40cf-a140-93f6f252a90d", "b54bb0aa-b557-48ec-9328-f8772bc0ccaf", "c8f94550-7097-4f50-87db-c76f45caf126", "d84e03fe-77f4-478f-a434-82715a95d17e", "ddabd49a-0594-4661-ab29-d9728dde2b2d"], "title": "The case for end-user programming of ubiquitous computing environments", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2010, "id": "94a45f45-304a-4a8a-ad1e-d22498529c3d"}
{"abstract": "To implement the atomicity in accessing the irregular data structure, developers often use the coarse-grained locking because the hierarchical nature of the data structure makes the reasoning of fine-grained locking difficult and error-prone for the update of an ancestor field in the data structure may affect its descendants. The coarse-grained locking disallows the concurrent accesses to the entire data structure and leads to a low degree of concurrency. We propose an approach, built upon the Multiple Granularity Lock (MGL), that replaces the coarse-grained locks to unleash more concurrency for irregular data structures. Our approach is widely applicable and does not require the data structures to have special shapes. We produce the MGL locks through reasoning about the hierarchy of the data structure and the accesses to it. According to the evaluation results on widely used applications, our optimization brings the significant speedup, e.g., at least 7%-20% speedup and up to 2X speedup.", "authors": ["Peng Liu", "Charles Zhang"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["04e91904-6156-4867-8e87-5a6f2d41d6fe", "10cfb399-5a03-4300-baa2-0df8ea0706cc", "1bd99eaf-1d4d-4693-a3b5-ccd1816ef5f1", "2a447108-70d0-4e72-9a86-3c89b618c24e", "35b671b4-5e95-4a09-bae3-f0d94e648119", "381ab41d-2a62-44bf-a2b5-079e9b6cbce6", "38dd6216-b5f1-44b6-8550-51b13510eb8c", "398bb790-5076-4c0c-9e2f-0b4b6ebe2a0a", "62ea2256-8334-46fa-8ca1-aac92c4f5818", "710748f5-8032-4fa6-9204-0aff13df12ec", "715aab8c-f964-41a9-9f0d-a5bddbd02fe5", "75a18d6e-b11f-4f47-874d-19eb230a7719", "813f966e-0a35-4ae8-8f89-a2b43187482d", "8b9be692-831e-40e4-97eb-ceceb0a1c319", "8f701df1-482e-420c-b1f3-221332982b41", "905a9087-08e7-4ea9-ae8c-98f2b1bbe72d", "a7969b5a-ea60-468d-b467-16df3dbc127b", "b2510878-51bd-4d89-a7f6-8800dcb49b0c", "b2800d2d-8d37-484a-99bb-6e5f9a90c348", "b40081ad-1896-4723-b07f-f0e676103734", "bc2e24cb-25f3-4ba9-9950-0ffd24cb1441", "bea59bed-0a38-4378-8a0c-271713af7b6b", "c360fbf4-62a4-48f7-884f-4043715fcdd7", "c4cecfb2-0161-4e93-afe4-2a1ff29af65b", "ca7938b3-3719-4337-b82d-f9d19b6fc6b7", "d24572af-79c3-4472-aba6-254356e5fb51", "e00a0dd5-de0a-444b-b381-4d8ccfdf31f6", "f7061ce9-5a20-44ae-9117-7ced2102295b"], "title": "Unleashing concurrency for irregular data structures", "venue": "international conference on software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "94a87b86-ea92-41dd-8e49-5c7b786e17c3"}

We call our new module construct the  classpect . We make three basic claims. First, we can realize a unified design without significantly compromising the expressiveness of current aspect languages. Second, such a design improves the conceptual integrity of the programming model. Third, it significantly improves the compositionality of aspect modules, expanding the program design space from the two-layered model of AspectJ-like languages to include hierarchical structures. To support these claims, we present the design and implementation of Eos-U, an AspectJ-like language based on C# that supports classpects as the basic unit of modularity. We show that Eos-U supports layered designs in which classpects separate integration concerns flexibly at multiple levels of composition. The underpinnings of our design include support for aspect instantiation under program control, instance-level advising, advising as a  general  alternative to object-oriented method invocation and overriding, and the provision of a separate join-point-method binding construct.", "authors": ["Hridesh Rajan", "Kevin J.

{"abstract": "Software development is inherently incremental; however, it is challenging to correctly introduce changes on top of existing code. Recent studies show that 15%-24% of the bug fixes are incorrect, and the most important yet hard-to-acquire information for programming changes is whether this change breaks any code elsewhere. This paper presents a framework, called Hydrogen, for patch verification. Hydrogen aims to automatically determine whether a patch correctly fixes a bug, a new bug is introduced in the change, a bug can impact multiple software releases, and the patch is applicable for all the impacted releases. Hydrogen consists of a novel program representation, namely multiversion interprocedural control flow graph (MVICFG), that integrates and compares control flow of multiple versions of programs, and a demand-driven, path-sensitive symbolic analysis that traverses the MVICFG for detecting bugs related to software changes and versions. In this paper, we present the definition, construction and applications of MVICFGs. Our experimental results show that Hydrogen correctly builds desired MVICFGs and is scalable to real-life programs such as libpng, tightvnc and putty.

An iterative approach is used in this work to account for the vibrational dynamics and avoid unwanted vibrations in the achieved excitation waveforms, and thereby enable the evaluation of different excitation waveforms on mixing. The main contribution of this work is to use these controlled, excitation waveforms for showing that (i) mixing time is substantially reduced (by more than an order of magnitude) with the use of cilia when compared to the case without cilia and (ii) mixing time with cilia can be further reduced (by more than half) by using an asymmetric excitation waveform when compared to sinusoidal excitation.", "authors": ["Jiradech Kongthon", "Santosh Devasia"], "n_citation": 0, "references": ["3f27d9e0-1940-4955-a920-bc2ee751462a", "b792896f-aeec-42dd-9b09-2a0d1bb37224"], "title": "Iterative inversion-based control of piezoactuator for evaluating cilia-based micro-mixing", "venue": "advances in computing and communications", "year": 2012, "id": "951a7dd7-bfe9-4222-9dba-1c3675a7716e"}

Binary search techniques are efficient for searching large files, but the associated file organization is not readily adapted to the file alterations. Conversely, a chained file allocation permits e 1 cient alteration but cannot be searched efficiently. A file organized into a tree-like structure is discussed, and it is shown that such a file may both be searched and altered with times proportional to  s  log  s    N , where  N  is the number of file items and  s  is a parameter of the tree. It is also shown that optimizing the value of  s  leads to a search time which is only 25 per cent slower than the binary search. The tree organization employs two data chains and may be considered to be a compromise between the organizations for the binary search and the chained file. The relation of the tree organization to multidimensional indexing and to the trie structure is also discussed.", "authors": ["Edward H.

{"abstract": "Presented in this paper is a variation of the Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) algorithm that converges to the centralized MPC solution for a steady state target optimization with a minimum of communication between plants. This variation, referred to as neighbor-communication MPC, leverages the network topology frequently found in large building HVAC systems; namely, a series of plants where the output of each is a disturbance to other plants. Each plant communicates to its neighbor its intended control action as well as the effects others' actions will have on itself. By judicious construction of the cost functions, all of the cost information is propagated through the network, allowing a global optimal solution to be reached. The novelty of this approach is that communication between all plants is not necessary to achieve a global optimum, and that changes in one controller do not require changes to all controllers in the network. The approach is demonstrated with a simulated example.", "authors": ["Matthew S. Elliott", "Bryan P.

{"abstract": "The solution of linear systems having real, symmetric, diagonally dominant, tridiagonal coefficient matrices with constant diagonals is considered. It is proved that the diagonals of the  LU  decomposition of the coefficient matrix rapidly converge to full floating-point precision. It is also proved that the computed  LU  decomposition converges when floating-point arithmetic is used and that the limits of the  LU  diagonals using floating point are roughly within machine precision of the limits using real arithmetic. This fact is exploited to reduce the number of floating-point operations required to solve a linear system from 8 n  - 7 to 5 n  + 2 k  - 3, where  k  is much less than  n , the order of the matrix. If the elements of the subdiagnals and superdiagonals are 1, then only 4 n  + 2 k  - 3 operations are needed. The entire  LU  decomposition takes  k  words of storage, and considerable savings in array subscripting are achieved. Upper and lower bounds on  k  are obtained in terms of the ratio of the coefficient matrix diagonal constants and parameters of the floating-point number system.  Various generalizations of these results are discussed.", "authors": ["Michael Malcolm", "John Palmer"], "n_citation": 38, "references": [], "title": "A fast method for solving a class of tridiagonal linear systems", "venue": "Communications of The ACM", "year": 1974, "id": "9549771e-69d9-4c55-8742-fc9d2de3d79b"}

{"abstract": "The IT model curriculum represents an excellent starting point toward understanding more about IT as an academic discipline.    The early 1990s saw the emergence of the Internet from the environs of the technical cognoscenti into the dot-com world with an interface for the masses. Additionally, the personal computer had reached the point that essentially everyone in all enterprises had one, and used it heavily. The increased complexity and importance of computing technologies for the success of organizations and individuals led to a growing need for professionals to select, create, apply, integrate, and administer an organizational IT infrastructure. Organizations typically filled these positions using individuals with widely varying backgrounds whose educational experiences often provided poor preparation for the demands of the position. The skill sets needed for the new breed of network and system administrators were not provided by the more algorithmically and analytically oriented computer science programs of the time. Moreover, information systems programs, with the business education requirements of their accreditation bodies, were equally unwilling or unable to include the technical depth required.    In response to this new educational need, programs arose such as those from Purdue University and Pennsylvania College of Technology, which were called Information Systems (IS) and Computer Science (CS) respectively, but were something else entirely.    These programs, and others like them, had sprung up independently and spontaneously to satisfy the needs of employers for workers with skills in networks, distributed systems, and beginning in the mid-1990s, the Web. By the peak of the dot-com boom in 2000, there were at least 17 institutions around the U.S. that had or were forming programs with similar characteristics, and which were most commonly called \"Information Technology.\" The largest of them was at Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) in Rochester, NY, with over 600 undergraduate students, as well as a sizable master's program.    On the national level, other factors were developing that also contributed to the emergence of the IT discipline. The Computing Sciences Accrediting Board (CSAB), which had long been the primary accrediting body for CS education, was joining with ABET, which accredits engineering and technology programs. Within ABET both the newly formed Computing Accreditation Commission (CAC) and the Technology Accreditation Commission (TAC) had noticed the emerging IT programs, and were wondering under which commission IT would best fit.    It was in this lively environment that a group was formed that would guide IT through the period of defining its own model curriculum, its place with respect to the other computing programs already extant, and its own accreditation criteria. The Society for Information Technology Education (SITE) was formed in December 2001, with participation from 15 institutions with programs that could be considered to be IT programs. SITE later became SIGITE (a special interest group of the ACM) in the summer of 2003.    At this first meeting in December 2001 (the Conference on Information Technology Curriculum, or CITC-1), committees were formed to formulate accreditation criteria and a model curriculum; and a Delphi study was conducted to determine which topics the participants thought should be covered in an IT program. At this meeting, the community also started work on a succinct definition of the discipline of IT, an effort that eventually cumulated in the following definition:    \"IT, as an academic discipline, is concerned with issues related to  advocating for users  and meeting their needs within an organizational and societal context through the  selection, creation, application, integration and administration  of computing technologies.\"    Another conference was planned for the following April and the momentum continued through CITC-2 (April 2002), CITC-3 (September 2002), and CITC-4 (October 2003), which was also SIGITE 2003.", "authors": ["Barry M.

{"abstract": "Perhaps one of the most powerful symbols of the United States' technological prowess is the Mission Control Center (MCC) at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston. The rooms at Mission Control have been witness to major milestones in the history of American technology such as the first lunar landing, the rescue of Skylab, and the first launch of the Space Shuttle. When Mission Control was first activated in the early 1960s it was truly a technological marvel. This facility, however, has received only modest upgrades since the Apollo program. Until recently it maintained a mainframe-based architecture that displayed data and left the job of data analysis to flight controllers. The display technology utilized in this system was monochrome and primarily displayed text information with limited graphics (photo 1).  An example display of 250 communication parameters is shown in Figure 1. The mainframe processed incoming data and displayed it to the flight controllers; however it performed few functions to convert raw data into information. The job of converting data into information upon which flight decisions could be made was performed by the flight controllers. In some cases, where additional computational support was required, small offline personal computers were added to the complex. Flight controllers visually copied data off the console display screens, and manually entered the data into the small personal computers where offline analysis could be performed.  Although this system was technologically outdated, it contained years of customizing efforts and served NASA well through the early Space Shuttle program. Several factors are now driving NASA to change the architecture of Mission Control to accommodate advanced automation. First is the requirement to support an increased flight rate without major growth in the number of personnel assigned to flight control duties.  A second major concern is loss of corporate knowledge due to the unique bimodal age distribution of NASA staff. Hiring freezes between the Apollo and Shuttle programs have resulted in NASA being composed of two primary groups. Approximately half of NASA consists of Apollo veterans within five years of retirement. The other half consists of personnel under the age of 35 with Shuttle-only experience. NASA considers it highly desirable to capture the corporate knowledge of the Apollo veterans in knowledge-based systems before they retire. Because the mainframe complex is primarily oriented to data display, it is a poor environment for capturing and utilizing knowledge.  These factors have resulted in aggressive efforts by NASA's Mission Operations Directorate to utilize the following: a distributed system of Unix engineering-class workstations to run a mix of online real-time expert systems, and traditional automation to allow flight controllers to perform more tasks and to capture the corporate knowledge of senior personnel. Starting with the first flight of the Space Shuttle after the Challenger accident, the Real-Time Data System (RTDS) has played an increasingly significant role in the flight-critical decision-making process.", "authors": ["J.

{"abstract": "Many software defect prediction approaches have been proposed and most are effective in within-project prediction settings. However, for new projects or projects with limited training data, it is desirable to learn a prediction model by using sufficient training data from existing source projects and then apply the model to some target projects (cross-project defect prediction). Unfortunately, the per
