{"abstract": "Prior research on pair programming has found that compared to students who work alone, students who pair have shown increased confidence in their work, greater success in CS1, and greater retention in computer-related majors. In these earlier studies, pairing and solo students were not given the same programming assignments. This paper reports on a study in which this factor was controlled by giving the same programming assignments to pairing and solo students. We found that pairing students were more likely to turn in working programs, and these programs correctly implemented more required features. Our findings were mixed when we looked at some standard complexity measures of programs. An unexpected but significant finding was that pairing students were more likely to submit solutions to their programming assignments.", "authors": ["Brian Hanks", "Charlie McDowell", "David Draper", "Milovan Krnjajic"], "n_citation": 115, "references": ["02e0342a-33d3-4d3f-9f1d-b14081edbc39", "10aae0d3-3c25-43ed-ab4c-5393933be347", "1ff29632-80e2-44a4-b58b-dda965ed99ad", "80dc41ef-3afb-4057-b101-b2df56650985", "b051425b-d077-4b71-8278-d6d17d13bf51"], "title": "Program quality with pair programming in CS1", "venue": "technical symposium on computer science education", "year": 2004, "id": "8cf2730e-a504-4eab-8ccf-d50bb26d0c51"}
{"abstract": "We investigate the scalability of feedback in multicast communication and propose a new method of probabilistic feedback based on exponentially distributed timers. By analysis and simulation for up to 10/sup 6/ receivers, we show that feedback implosion is avoided while feedback latency is low. The mechanism is robust against the loss of feedback messages and works well in case of homogeneous and heterogeneous delays. We apply the feedback mechanism to reliable multicast and compare it to existing timer-based feedback schemes. Our mechanism achieves lower negative acknowledgment character (NAK) latency for the same performance in terms of NAK suppression. No topological information of the network is used, and data delivery is the only support required from the network. The mechanism adapts to a dynamic number of receivers and leads to a stable performance for implosion avoidance and feedback latency.", "authors": ["J\u00f6rg Nonnenmacher", "Ernst W.

Using a comparison principle approach we present a numerical method for estimating the asymptotic gain characterizing the effect of external disturbances on the stability of a large-scale interconnection. The key contribution is to make use of solely the knowledge of one single trajectory of the comparison system for estimating the behavior of all possible trajectories. It is shown that an asymptotic gain can be obtained from just a single trajectory of a disturbance-free comparison system. The single-trajectory approach leads to a computationally cheap numerical check for the input-to-state practical stability property of a large-scale system.", "authors": ["Bj\u00f6rn S.

Current crowdsourcing platforms have some limitations in the area of quality control.

We propose a simple model for adaptive quality control in crowdsourced multiple-choice tasks which we call the bandit survey problem.

{"abstract": "Peer code review has been adopted as an effective quality improvement practice by many Open Source Software (OSS) communities. In addition to increasing software quality, there is anecdotal evidence that peer code review has other benefits, including: sharing knowledge, sharing expertise, sharing development techniques, and most importantly building accurate peer impressions between the code review participants. To further investigate the presence of these benefits, we surveyed members of popular OSS communities who were involved with peer code review. We used established scales from Psychology, Information science, and Organizational Behavior to create survey questions. We also enforced multiple reliability and validity measures to ensure higher confidence in the survey results. In this paper, we present a subset of the surveys results focused on better understanding four aspects of peer impression formation: trust, reliability, perception of expertise, and friendship. The results indicate that there is indeed a high level of trust, reliability, perception of expertise, and friendship between OSS peers who have participated in code review for a period of time. Because code review involves examining someone else's code, unsurprisingly, peer code review helped most in building a perception of expertise between code review partners.", "authors": ["Amiangshu Bosu", "Jeffrey C.

The tool validates networks of communicating processes implemented in the virtual finite state machine (VFSM) notation, using Holzmann's (1991) super-trace algorithm to check for errors in process interaction such as deadlock, livelock, unexpected inputs, message buffer overflow, and unreachable code. The validator has been used by several 5ESS developers to find bugs in their VFSM designs.

{"abstract": "Can one use cell phones for earthquake early warning? Detecting rare, disruptive events using community-held sensors is a promising opportunity, but also presents difficult challenges. Rare events are often difficult or impossible to model and characterize a priori, yet we wish to maximize detection performance. Further, heterogeneous, community-operated sensors may differ widely in quality and communication constraints. In this paper, we present a principled approach towards detecting rare events that learns sensor-specific decision thresholds online, in a distributed way. It maximizes anomaly detection performance at a fusion center, under constraints on the false alarm rate and number of messages per sensor. We then present an implementation of our approach in the Community Seismic Network (CSN), a community sensing system with the goal of rapidly detecting earthquakes using cell phone accelerometers, consumer USB devices and cloud-computing based sensor fusion. We experimentally evaluate our approach based on a pilot deployment of the CSN system. Our results, including data from shake table experiments, indicate the effectiveness of our approach in distinguishing seismic motion from accelerations due to normal daily manipulation. They also provide evidence of the feasibility of earthquake early warning using a dense network of cell phones.", "authors": ["Matthew Faulkner", "Michael Olson", "Rishi Chandy", "Jonathan Krause", "K.

{"abstract": "The end product of architecting is an architectural hierarchy, a collection of architectural descriptions linked by mappings that interpret the more abstract descriptions in the more concrete descriptions. Formalized transformational approaches to architecture refinement and abstraction have been proposed. One argument in favor of formalization is that it can result in architectural implementations that are guaranteed to be correct, relative to the abstract descriptions. If these are correct with respect to one another, conclusions obtained by reasoning from an abstract architectural description will also apply to the implemented architecture. But this correctness guarantee is achieved by requiring that the implementer use only verified transformations, i.e., ones that have been proven to produce correct results when applied. This paper explores an approach that allows the implementer to use transformations that have not been proven to be generally correct, without voiding the correctness guarantee. Checking means determining that application of the transformation produces the desired result. It allows the use of transformations that have not been generally verified, even ones that are known to sometimes produce incorrect results, by showing that they work in the particular case.", "authors": ["Robert A.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a numerical procedure for the reachability analysis of systems with nonlinear, semi-explicit, index-1 differential-algebraic equations. The procedure computes reachable sets for uncertain initial states and inputs in an overapproximative way, i.e. it is guaranteed that all possible trajectories of the system are enclosed. Thus, the result can be used for formal verification of system properties that can be specified in the state space as unsafe or goal regions. Due to the representation of reachable sets by zonotopes and the use of highly scalable operations on them, the presented approach scales favorably with the number of state variables. This makes it possible to solve problems of industry-relevant size, as demonstrated by a transient stability analysis of the IEEE 14-bus benchmark problem for power systems.", "authors": ["Matthias Althoff", "Bruce H.

{"abstract": "Code cloning is a controversial software engineering practice due to contradictory claims regarding its effect on software maintenance. Code stability is a recently introduced measurement technique that has been used to determine the impact of code cloning by quantifying the changeability of a code region. Although most of the existing stability analysis studies agree that cloned code is more stable than non-cloned code, the studies have two major flaws: (i) each study only considered a single stability measurement (e.g., lines of code changed, frequency of change, age of change); and, (ii) only a small number of subject systems were analyzed and these were of limited variety.   In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study on code stability using three different stability measuring methods. We use a recently introduced hybrid clone detection tool, NiCAD, to detect the clones and analyze their stability in four dimensions: by clone type, by measuring method, by programming language, and by system size and age. Our four-dimensional investigation on 12 diverse subject systems written in three programming languages considering three clone types reveals that: (i) Type-1 and Type-2 clones are unstable, but Type-3 clones are not; (ii) clones in Java and C systems are not as stable as clones in C# systems; (iii) a system's development strategy might play a key role in defining its comparative code stability scenario; and, (iv) cloned and non-cloned regions of a subject system do not follow a consistent change pattern.", "authors": ["Manishankar Mondal", "Chanchal K.

The main contribution is twofold: to provide some experimental insights about the behavior of the variable importance index based on random forests and to propose a strategy involving a ranking of explanatory variables using the random forests score of importance and a stepwise ascending variable introduction strategy.", "authors": ["Robin Genuer", "Jean-Michel Poggi", "Christine Tuleau-Malot"], "n_citation": 582, "references": ["0f115eea-2272-431f-9f21-6d6789b2bbc9", "3f10cd7a-fa3a-4df0-9517-4215a7c5f93a", "4746dd3a-008d-4529-be20-578d0f90408c", "4fb87930-7f6c-4f03-ae22-32445138ec83", "517b80c5-8d01-45fc-8ef4-6b33cf325409", "5f8f7c01-a1b8-4f84-b75f-e06768f1ddce", "685b313d-8a77-481e-9456-e405a1d29549", "6c871065-76b8-44f3-97d5-ac3bce951421", "9fa61eb1-0984-4492-955a-4f7aedbdc368", "9fd5b3a5-5218-4e19-9441-2535440c0be0", "b3bd58f5-cce6-499b-903a-8c1f2189f1c0", "c5b72e8b-a08e-4b70-94db-d7d67568a81a", "f6bd8b64-684d-429a-aab5-8ff3a2c23cd6", "f98f3e2b-d93b-4c34-bb55-f2acc0cddab6"], "title": "Variable selection using random forests", "venue": "Pattern Recognition Letters", "year": 2010, "id": "c72392ba-82e3-4fb9-8407-b8df003f1103"}

{"abstract": "We consider extending decision support facilities toward large sophisticated networks, upon which multidimensional attributes are associated with network entities, thereby forming the so-called multidimensional networks. Data warehouses and OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) technology have proven to be effective tools for decision support on relational data. However, they are not well-equipped to handle the new yet important multidimensional networks. In this paper, we introduce Graph Cube, a new data warehousing model that supports OLAP queries effectively on large multidimensional networks. By taking account of both attribute aggregation and structure summarization of the networks, Graph Cube goes beyond the traditional data cube model involved solely with numeric value based group-by's, thus resulting in a more insightful and structure-enriched aggregate network within every possible multidimensional space. Besides traditional cuboid queries, a new class of OLAP queries, crossboid, is introduced that is uniquely useful in multidimensional networks and has not been studied before. We implement Graph Cube by combining special characteristics of multidimensional networks with the existing well-studied data cube techniques. We perform extensive experimental studies on a series of real world data sets and Graph Cube is shown to be a powerful and efficient tool for decision support on large multidimensional networks.", "authors": ["Peixiang Zhao", "Xialolei Li", "Dong Xin", "Jiawei Han"], "n_citation": 123, "references": ["196803d1-e419-4897-9dc9-b760208c802e", "2c066e28-3565-481b-822a-e13830532f82", "363fbc9c-bc8a-4e12-9475-fe2953693370", "44fabd07-6bb0-4a2d-a415-1dd644b12ebe", "50441910-8aae-4611-8b35-da5d55daa29c", "5a790a9b-e677-45a1-9e8c-671eead883e1", "62c7dcb8-a9fe-4a3f-96d0-36097d9c2036", "6415d03e-6198-44d4-9ca7-4308cab5ba7f", "7fea8db4-18fa-4a92-8a62-8be0fb745907", "844b107c-3126-443f-83c1-8dfc7e7238fa", "8b700e2c-c6c5-46a3-9b29-178b0a3cbae1", "9014178f-ebf4-48a6-97a6-8b06da4b47a9", "913a73c4-9c77-4205-ae03-dde2f86b2a84", "92d18205-9a2f-422f-9fe4-4c90e16d1d9f", "9f907f6a-f252-4f6b-8955-ff50970d31a8", "a8441b03-b969-495d-960f-535489ae81f5", "bfb917da-50f9-4a18-9671-c6a575eb1b30", "d3c5fc62-2f5b-4ab2-a321-564ef9232643", "df8c3077-3500-41fd-a698-71085330555e", "e95957bf-063a-4a55-8496-c3890204f1e2", "f1226e42-44ee-4b77-8408-d3d035ad181a", "f829405f-d94b-4a3e-867e-8ffd39941651"], "title": "Graph cube: on warehousing and OLAP multidimensional networks", "venue": "international conference on management of data", "year": 2011, "id": "8b6f9e34-2101-4e25-ba1f-55813e995e36"}

{"abstract": "The figure-ground discrimination problem is considered from a combinatorial optimization perspective. A mathematical model encoding the figure-ground discrimination problem that makes explicit a definition of shape based on cocircularity, smoothness, proximity, and contrast is presented. This model consists of building a cost function on the basis of image element interactions. This cost function fits the constraints of an interacting spin system that, in turn, is a well suited physical model that solves hard combinatorial optimization problems. Two combinatorial optimization methods for solving the figure-ground problem, namely mean field annealing, which combines mean field approximation theory and annealing, and microcanonical annealing, are discussed. Mean field annealing may be viewed as a deterministic approximation of stochastic methods such as simulated annealing. The theoretical bases of these methods are described, and the computational models are derived. The efficiencies of mean field annealing, simulated annealing, and microcanonical annealing algorithms are compared. Within the framework of such a comparison, the figure-ground problem may be viewed as a benchmark. >", "authors": ["Laurent Herault", "Radu Horaud"], "n_citation": 189, "references": ["1c63e1d5-b963-455b-829d-e4f3eb63a36a", "37e76afb-f79f-41f8-b75d-28dadd7d5cd7", "3f4cc95c-5f47-4031-8671-e23ff4fe2ed2", "6cd1fccd-865f-4d54-b037-d622dbcfaf00", "6e0d7a60-4787-4348-84a5-5b94664a5777", "6fd932e6-412c-46a6-a623-1e582e0a04e4", "8725c694-e67d-4a83-9164-9018f3967224", "9216f926-09a0-44af-9ad1-516939713859", "9a09b515-2ba1-4a8e-a4fe-d81bdca1ef74", "b9210c17-1622-4bda-a291-656667113d81", "c1ce519c-124d-495e-a9df-99371a6b59ad", "cd90e104-f991-4cce-92d8-70c719e84ebe"], "title": "Figure-ground discrimination: a combinatorial optimization approach", "venue": "pattern recognition and machine intelligence", "year": 1993, "id": "e3da2b36-1e0e-43cf-a599-c7fc707e7f95"}
{"abstract": "In a connection-oriented wireless LAN, the mobility of mobile hosts results in the establishment and disconnection of new and old virtual circuits. The resulting increase in signalling traffic along with the need to support multimedia stream handovers demand a fast, continuous and bandwidth-efficient handover protocol. We adopt a handover scheme based on partial re-establishments, where a new partial path converges to an existing path. Connection rerouting (CR) operations are then performed at the convergence/crossover switch (CX). To achieve localised handovers, a wireless cell clustering scheme is proposed. The clustering of base stations to cluster switches (CLSs) provides fast intra-cluster handovers since the CR operations are performed at the CLS. To support fast inter-cluster handovers, four CX discovery schemes (loose select, prior path, distributed hunt and backward tracking) are introduced. Simulation results obtained from a trace-driven mobile network simulator on four different network topologies (random, star, tree and hierarchical redundancy) reveal that both prior path and distributed hunt discoveries outperform the others by providing the fastest convergence with shorter resulting paths and higher circuit reuse efficiency.", "authors": ["Chai-Keong Toh"], "n_citation": 114, "references": ["01029a78-d799-4aa0-b1df-554eae0a2fd0", "059e7002-0887-4267-911c-fe782cee450b", "58f7c736-c9be-404c-8f64-6594853b5ed2", "71b7c4aa-4408-4c69-b334-6bf3da873f07"], "title": "Performance evaluation of crossover switch discovery algorithms for wireless ATM LANs", "venue": "international conference on computer communications", "year": 1996, "id": "32ca8521-dba9-4136-867d-5a715bbdca97"}
{"abstract": "The current state of the art for ensuring finite unfolding of logic programs consists of a number of online techniques where unfolding decisions are made at specialisation time. Introduction of a static termination analysis phase into a partial deduction algorithm permits unfolding decisions to be made offine, before the actual specialisation phase itself.

{"abstract": "The design and optimization of multicarrier communications systems often involve a maximization of the total throughput subject to system resource constraints. The optimization problem is numerically difficult to solve when the problem does not have a convexity structure. This paper makes progress toward solving optimization problems of this type by showing that under a certain condition called the time-sharing condition, the duality gap of the optimization problem is always zero, regardless of the convexity of the objective function. Further, we show that the time-sharing condition is satisfied for practical multiuser spectrum optimization problems in multicarrier systems in the limit as the number of carriers goes to infinity. This result leads to efficient numerical algorithms that solve the nonconvex problem in the dual domain. We show that the recently proposed optimal spectrum balancing algorithm for digital subscriber lines can be interpreted as a dual algorithm. This new interpretation gives rise to more efficient dual update methods. It also suggests ways in which the dual objective may be evaluated approximately, further improving the numerical efficiency of the algorithm. We propose a low-complexity iterative spectrum balancing algorithm based on these ideas, and show that the new algorithm achieves near-optimal performance in many practical situations", "authors": ["Wei Yu", "Raymond Lui"], "n_citation": 1067, "references": ["199c3eb4-83d4-4e9a-a4ce-af890dbbb319", "253df6ac-3dce-4fe5-bada-d14d733c0935", "31673314-8019-4c99-957d-cfcbba1c94a6", "382e5c80-c6ce-4c15-a1d2-a3efe4eb6cab", "477191b0-a243-4ddc-ae1f-ca7073356158", "602c7d9c-29e6-4c1a-863e-9aa83c99910c", "70623823-97e9-4bf1-97a5-9ed393c70374", "718e18d2-5cff-4cc3-afc1-410db4eb0fe1", "7f891f55-de75-40a3-b582-99558d570f67", "88a25eb3-6dad-4834-b18c-af1176ee4335", "bc390927-ad14-4f02-8159-1eb3be01386a", "c8000ce0-36b4-4d92-93ed-afcf7b78d8ac", "d0026c4b-1de8-4d5a-ad02-b10872eb8310", "e88bb807-6a14-4c41-b57b-bd8f4c880344", "f79248af-a60c-4542-bcab-c944807c33c0"], "title": "Dual methods for nonconvex spectrum optimization of multicarrier systems", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Communications", "year": 2006, "id": "db2f9b6e-1f6e-47b4-870d-4a3e3e392f59"}

{"abstract": "In a sensor network of n nodes, each node i is assigned with a time-dependent scalar state x i (t) and is able to exchange information with a certain number of other nodes called its neighbor nodes. The distributed averaging algorithm is to drive each x i (t), 1\u2264 i\u2264 n, to converge to 1/n\u03a3 i=1  n  x i (0), the average of the initial state values of all nodes, only by communication between each node and its neighbor nodes. This paper proposes a new request-based distributed averaging protocol using the idea of compensation, in which at each time t each node i first updates its state to a weighted average of its own current state x i (t) and the current states of some neighbor nodes and then compensates its updated value by the change in the sums, before and after the update, of the states of all the nodes involved. It is proved that the proposed protocol drives all the x i (t) to converge to 1/n\u03a3 i=1  n  x i (0). Simulations on random networks are also provided to show that this new protocol converges much faster and consumes less energy than the deterministic gossiping protocol in [1].", "authors": ["Shaoshuai Mou", "Ming Cao"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["3c24e98a-ef68-4e47-bb92-09ec0991ea0a", "4a78d773-7703-4de6-9881-2bcef9e336ea", "6c2eaed9-e5e0-4319-a834-6ce5b2495526", "ad0da506-60bb-4252-a79f-9169b85d378f", "b0c4314f-bd45-4e8d-adac-7c3cc3fa279f", "d5458425-5537-42f5-89dc-6de2d8437779", "d7b5aadf-ec30-4fb7-9224-7474169d3744", "dcc0a9fe-6804-4e92-96f6-199b4d9597e2", "e67634bd-1e1f-4bca-99f8-85cde1d92ab0", "e9a0e9b2-d83c-4c5f-8b71-45cc3dd9b010", "eb3fd4bc-564e-4cab-8022-e066206f3987"], "title": "Distributed Averaging Using Compensation", "venue": "IEEE Communications Letters", "year": 2013, "id": "dc342539-c800-4243-bfb3-f478eaf5addc"}

{"abstract": "Programming, testing, and maintaining interactive multimedia applications (IMAs) are still difficult and expensive, while substantial progress has been made to reduce the burden on authors. As IMAs get larger and more complex the difficulties will increase. To overcome the complexity of such IMAs, we argue that authoring systems should provide such facilities as (1) a traditional and intuitivedivide-and-conquer paradigm for solving large and complex problems in various fields, (2)formal specification of the behaviors of IMAs for checking the syntactic correctness of visual expressions or semantic anomalies, and (3)automatic aids like validation of temporal constraints and verification of visual expressions. In this paper, we investigate the properties of IMAs for recognizing the inherent interactivity and concurrency. We propose a specification method based on Milner'sCalculus of Communicating Systems (CCS), which is a well-known formal mechanism for specifying the concurrency in various distributed applications. We also design and implement an authoring system calledEventor (Event Editor), which is based on CCS and composed of three tools: a Temporal Synchronizer, a Spatial Synchronizer, and a User Interaction Builder. They focus on describing the temporal and spatial synchronizations and user interactions while they rely on existing tools in Intel's Digital Video Interactive (DVI) for supporting other functionalities. By editing a simple computer aided instruction (CAI) application, we illustrate that our specification mechanism is well-suited for handling the interactivity of multimedia applications, and Eventor is a simple, efficient, and powerful enough tool to handle practical applications.

{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#Parameterization of discrete surfaces is a fundamental and widely-used operation in graphics, required, for instance, for texture mapping or remeshing. As 3D data becomes more and more detailed, there is an increased need for fast and robust techniques to automatically compute least-distorted parameterizations of large meshes. In this paper, we present new theoretical and practical results on the parameterization of triangulated surface patches. Given a few desirable properties such as rotation and translation invariance, we show that the only admissible parameterizations form a two-dimensional set and each parameterization in this set can be computed using a simple, sparse, linear system. Since these parameterizations minimize the distortion of different intrinsic measures of the original mesh, we call them Intrinsic Parameterizations.

{"abstract": "Band selection is a common approach to reduce the data dimensionality of hyperspectral imagery. It extracts several bands of importance in some sense by taking advantage of high spectral correlation. Driven by detection or classification accuracy, one would expect that, using a subset of original bands, the accuracy is unchanged or tolerably degraded, whereas computational burden is significantly relaxed. When the desired object information is known, this task can be achieved by finding the bands that contain the most information about these objects. When the desired object information is unknown, i.e., unsupervised band selection, the objective is to select the most distinctive and informative bands. It is expected that these bands can provide an overall satisfactory detection and classification performance. In this letter, we propose unsupervised band selection algorithms based on band similarity measurement. The experimental result shows that our approach can yield a better result in terms of information conservation and class separability than other widely used techniques.", "authors": ["Qian Du", "He Yang"], "n_citation": 233, "references": ["26d35676-1f5d-4470-9956-3a2ccfb4a56b", "3c73a97f-3d80-43d9-8cc7-68c32ad40538", "590f82b0-d315-4fa2-ab51-29a972308389", "61981171-87cc-4785-a7a9-b769950bd171", "7a206ceb-6d43-4d4f-8919-14f4bd1eef68", "7c9375ac-20b0-4509-9d2f-5d3b9fbb8a9d", "abb8465f-4a5f-4baf-a139-ae47311493c7", "b8e46308-51d9-4fff-b3bb-8224c380b394", "c776b40b-af60-43d9-ae2a-f43ed016a5fa", "ea2776a5-6c47-473d-bd46-b2b534171707"], "title": "Similarity-Based Unsupervised Band Selection for Hyperspectral Image Analysis", "venue": "IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Letters", "year": 2008, "id": "2f8bcb34-551b-44aa-9d23-0d26478f562d"}

{"abstract": "Retrofitting design patterns into a program by hand is tedious and error-prone. A programmer must distinguish refactorings that are provided by an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from those that must be realized manually, determine a precise sequence of refactorings to apply, and perform this sequence repetitively to a laborious degree. We designed, implemented, and evaluated Reflective Refactoring (R 2 ), a Java package to automate the creation of classical design patterns (Visitor, Abstract Factory, etc.), their inverses, and variants. We encoded 18 out of 23 Gang-of-Four design patterns as R 2  scripts and explain why the remaining are inappropriate for refactoring engines. We evaluate the productivity and scalability of R 2  with a case study of 6 real-world applications. In one case, R 2  automatically created a Visitor with 276 visit methods by invoking 554 Eclipse refactorings in 10 minutes - an achievement that could not be done manually. R 2  also sheds light on why refactoring correctness, expressiveness, and speed are critical issues for scripting in next-generation refactoring engines.", "authors": ["Jongwook Kim", "Don S.

{"abstract": "This paper presents MARA, a joint mechanism for automatic rate selection and route quality evaluation in wireless mesh networks. This mechanism targets at avoiding the problems of lack of synchronization between metric and rate selection decisions and inaccurate link quality estimates, common to main existing proposals of multihop wireless routing metrics and automatic rate adaptation. In this proposal, the statistics collected by the routing protocol are used by the rate adaptation algorithm to compute the best rate for each wireless link. This coordinated decision aims at providing better routing and rate choices. In addition to the basic MARA algorithm, two variations are proposed: MARA-P and MARA-RP. The first considers the size of each packet in the transmission rate decision. The second variation considers the packet size also for the routing choices. For evaluation purposes, experiments were conducted on both real and simulated environments. In these experiments, MARA was compared to a number of rate adaptation algorithms and routing metrics. Results from both environments indicate that MARA may lead to an overall network performance improvement.", "authors": ["Diego G.

{"abstract": "Reducing power dissipation is one of the most principle subjects in VLSI design today. Scaling causes subthreshold leakage currents to become a large component of total power dissipation. This paper presents two techniques for efficient gate clustering in MTCMOS circuits by modeling the problem via Bin-Packing (BP) and Set-Partitioning (SP) techniques. An automated solution is presented, and both techniques are applied to six benchmarks to verify functionality. Both methodologies offer significant reduction in both dynamic and leakage power over previous techniques during the active and standby modes respectively. Furthermore, the SP technique takes the circuit's routing complexity into consideration which is critical for Deep Sub-Micron (DSM) implementations. Sufficient performance is achieved, while significantly reducing the overall sleep transistors' area. Results obtained indicate that our proposed techniques can achieve on average 90% savings for leakage power and 15% savings for dynamic power.", "authors": ["Mohab Anis", "Mohamed M. E. A.

{"abstract": "A linguistic, pedagogic and technological framework for an ICALL system called COPPER is presented here, where individual and collaborative learning are combined within a constructivist approach to facilitate second language learning. Based upon the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages, the ability to use language is viewed as one of several cognitive competences that are mobilised and modified when individuals communicate. To combine the different types of learning underlying the European Framework, a student model has been developed for COPPER that represents linguistic competences in a detailed way, combining high granularity expert-centric Bayesian networks with multidimensional stereotypes, and is updated following student activities semi-automatically. Instances of this model are used by an adaptive group formation algorithm that dynamically generates communicative groups based upon the linguistic capabilities of available students, and a collection of collaborative activity templates. As well as the student model, which is a representation of individual linguistic knowledge, preferences, etc., there is a group model, which is a representation of how a set of students works together. The results of a student's activity within a group are evaluated by a student monitor, with more advanced linguistic competences, thereby sidestepping the difficulties present when using NLP techniques to automatically analyse non-restricted linguistic production. The monitor role empowers students and further consolidates what has been previously learnt. Students therefore initially work individually in this framework on certain linguistic concepts, and subsequently participate in authentic collaborative communicative activities, where their linguistic competences can develop approximately as they would in `real foreign language immersion experiences'.", "authors": ["Timothy Read", "Beatriz Barros", "Elena B\u00e1rcena", "Jes\u00fas Pancorbo"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["03a7ec98-d9ae-4121-ad64-43634a80fb0b", "5c4db02c-3974-47e8-b103-15aa0b4b07ba", "5d2122b3-65c1-4f52-bf32-ea682b118273", "754f589e-9453-4e51-8bb9-b878cd072863", "8455771f-2659-4349-af0f-3d8a7343e5bd", "93416c6f-5e22-4528-b841-e51dd7a3eb64", "9f9153be-9a78-4cfa-875b-c7041ebb418c", "df2ba9d4-5558-4dac-b879-3feddeac0789", "fc41c271-3c9c-42b0-ad91-dae04ef422cd"], "title": "Coalescing individual and collaborative learning to model user linguistic competences", "venue": "User Modeling and User-adapted Interaction", "year": 2006, "id": "b258c52e-900c-47e5-8efa-37c5be8f508a"}
{"abstract": "The Microsoft .NET Framework is a new computing architecture designed to support a variety of distributed applications and web-based services. .NET software components are typically distributed in an object-oriented intermediate language, Microsoft IL, executed by the Microsoft Common Language Runtime. To allow convenient multi-language working, IL supports a wide variety of high-level language constructs, including class-based objects, inheritance, garbage collection, and a security mechanism based on type safe execution.This paper precisely describes the type system for a substantial fragment of IL that includes several novel features: certain objects may be allocated either on the heap or on the stack; those on the stack may be boxed onto the heap, and those on the heap may be unboxed onto the stack; methods may receive arguments and return results via typed pointers, which can reference both the stack and the heap, including the interiors of objects on the heap. We present a formal semantics for the fragment. Our typing rules determine well-typed IL instruction sequences that can be assembled and executed. Of particular interest are rules to ensure no pointer into the stack outlives its target. Our main theorem asserts type safety, that well-typed programs in our IL fragment do not lead to untrapped execution errors.Our main theorem does not directly apply to the product. Still, the formal system of this paper is an abstraction of informal and executable specifications we wrote for the full product during its development. Our informal specification became the basis of the product team's working specification of type-checking.

{"abstract": "In automated negotiation systems consisting of self-interested agents, contracts have traditionally been binding. Such contracts do not allow agents to efficiently accommodate future events. Game theory has proposed contingency contracts to solve this problem. Among computational agents, contingency contracts are often impractical due to large numbers of interdependent and unanticipated future events to be conditioned on, and because some events are not mutually observable. This paper proposes a leveled commitment contracting protocol that allows self-interested agents to efficiently accommodate future events by having the possibility of unilaterally decommitting from a contract based on local reasoning. A decommitment penalty is assigned to both agents in a contract: to be freed from the contract, an agent only pays this penalty to the other party. It is shown through formal analysis of several contracting settings that this leveled commitment feature in a contracting protocol increases Pareto efficiency of deals and can make contracts individually rational when no full commitment contract can. This advantage holds even if the agents decommit manipulatively.", "authors": ["Tuomas Sandholm", "Victor R.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we consider the development of a control strategy for path following of underactuated marine surface vessels in the presence of ocean currents. The proposed control strategy is based on a modified Line-of-Sight (LOS) guidance law with integral action and a pair of adaptive feedback controllers. Traditional LOS guidance has several nice properties and is widely used in practice for path following of marine vehicles. However, it has the drawback of being susceptible to environmental disturbances. In this work, we propose a modified LOS guidance law with integral action for counteracting environmental disturbances. Paired with a set of adaptive feedback controllers, we show that this approach guarantees global asymptotic path following of straight-line paths in the presence constant and irrotational ocean currents.", "authors": ["Even B\u00f8rhaug", "Alexey Pavlov", "Kristin Ytterstad Pettersen"], "n_citation": 121, "references": ["e3636c40-41e5-44a1-8981-c72945e4ea80", "f751ebbd-baa2-41c4-ac9f-ae3c0e572635"], "title": "Integral LOS control for path following of underactuated marine surface vessels in the presence of constant ocean currents", "venue": "conference on decision and control", "year": 2008, "id": "527d7d8e-9082-4f94-a7e9-44daa2b4b8a6"}

{"abstract": "A radio network (RN, for short) is a distributed system consisting of n radio stations. We assume that the stations are small, bulk-produced, hand-held devices running on batteries and cannot be distinguished by serial or manufacturing number. Since recharging batteries may not be possible while on mission, we are interested in designing protocols that are highly energy-efficient. The initialization problem is to assign each of the n stations in the RN a unique ID. The initialization problem is nontrivial since the stations are assumed to be indistinguishable. The problem is fundamental, since practically all communication protocols for RNs proceed under the assumption that the RN has been initialized in advance. The main contribution of this work is to propose energy-efficient randomized initialization protocols for single-hop RNs lacking collision detection capabilities. First, we show that if the number n of stations is known beforehand, the single-channel RN can be initialized by a protocol that terminates, with probability exceeding 1-/sup 1///sub n/ in O(n) time slots, with no station being awake for more than O(log log n) time slots.

We present Yeti, a tool that summarizes memory usage to uncover the costs of design decisions, rather than of lower-level artifacts as in traditional tools, making it possible to quickly identify and remediate problems. Yeti employs three progressive abstractions and corresponding visualizations: it identifies costly groups of objects that collectively perform a function, recovers a logical data model for each, and summarizes the implementation of each model entity and relationship.

The inputs of fuzzy controller are selected as the difference in state of charge, the average of state of charge and the total internal resistance. The overall performance of the proposed equalizer is evaluated by multi-indexes such as equalizing speed, efficiency and cell protection. Simulations are conducted based on a well established 6Ah Li-ion battery provided in Advisor. The results under various initial conditions show that the proposed equalizer has the ability to balance the equalizing speed and efficiency.

The system tracks hand motions and then maps that motion to the joint motions of a three-dimensional articulated avatar. As part of this research we will try out different ways of tracking the user's hand.

{"abstract": "Software-Defined Networking offers the appeal of a simple, centralized programming model for managing complex networks. However, challenges in managing low-level details, such as setting up and maintaining correct and efficient forwarding tables on distributed switches, often compromise this conceptual simplicity. In this pa- per, we present Maple, a system that simplifies SDN programming by (1) allowing a programmer to use a standard programming language to design an arbitrary,  centralized  algorithm, which we call an  algorithmic policy , to decide the behaviors of an entire network, and (2) providing an abstraction that the programmer-defined, centralized policy runs, conceptually, \"afresh\" on every packet entering a network, and hence is oblivious to the challenge of translating a high-level policy into sets of rules on distributed individual switches. To implement algorithmic policies efficiently, Maple includes not only a highly-efficient multicore scheduler that can scale efficiently to controllers with 40+ cores, but more importantly a novel  tracing  runtime optimizer that can automatically record reusable policy decisions, offload work to switches when possible, and keep switch flow tables up-to-date by dynamically tracing the dependency of policy decisions on packet contents as well as the  environment  (system state). Evaluations using real HP switches show that Maple optimizer reduces HTTP connection time by a factor of 100 at high load. During simulated benchmarking, Maple scheduler, when not running the optimizer, achieves a throughput of over 20 million new flow requests per second on a single machine, with 95-percentile latency under 10 ms.", "authors": ["Andreas Voellmy", "Junchang Wang", "Y.

{"abstract": "The number of software engineering research papers over the last few years has grown significantly. An important question here is: how relevant is software engineering research to practitioners in the field? To address this question, we conducted a survey at Microsoft where we invited 3,000 industry practitioners to rate the relevance of research ideas contained in 571 ICSE, ESEC/FSE and FSE papers that were published over a five year period. We received 17,913 ratings by 512 practitioners who labelled ideas as essential, worthwhile, unimportant, or unwise. The results from the survey suggest that practitioners are positive towards studies done by the software engineering research community: 71% of all ratings were essential or worthwhile. We found no correlation between the citation counts and the relevance scores of the papers. Through a qualitative analysis of free text responses, we identify several reasons why practitioners considered certain research ideas to be unwise. The survey approach described in this paper is lightweight: on average, a participant spent only 22.5 minutes to respond to the survey.

{"abstract": "We establish a statistical model for the ultra-wide bandwidth (UWB) indoor channel based on an extensive measurement campaign in a typical modern office building with 2-ns delay resolution. The approach is based on the investigation of the statistical properties of the multipath profiles measured in different rooms over a finely spaced measurement grid. The analysis leads to the formulation of a stochastic tapped-delay-line (STDL) model of the UWB indoor channel. The averaged power delay profile can be well-modeled by a single exponential decay with a statistically distributed decay constant. The small-scale statistics of path energy gains follow Gamma distributions whose parameters m are truncated Gaussian variables with mean values and standard deviations decreasing with delay. The total received energy experiences a lognormal shadowing around the mean energy given by the path-loss power law. We also find that the correlation between multipath components is negligible.

{"abstract": "While there are distributed algorithms for the MST problem, these algorithms require relatively large number of messages and time; this makes these algorithms impractical for resource-constrained networks such as ad hoc wireless sensor networks. In such networks, a sensor has very limited power, and any algorithm needs to be simple, local, and energy efficient for being practical. Motivated by these considerations, we design and analyze a class of simple and local distributed algorithms called nearest neighbor tree (NNT) algorithms for energy-efficient construction of MSTs in a wireless ad hoc setting. We assume that the nodes are uniformly distributed in a unit square and show provable bounds on the performance with respect to both the quality of the spanning tree produced and the energy needed to construct them. In particular, we show that NNT produces a close approximation to the MST, and they can be maintained dynamically with polylogarithmic number of rearrangements under node insertions/deletions. We also perform extensive simulations of our algorithms. We tested our algorithms on both uniformly random distributions of nodes, and on a realistic distributions of nodes in an urban setting. Simulations validate the theoretical results and show that the bounds are much better in practice.", "authors": ["Maleq Khan", "Gopal Pandurangan", "V. S.

Analysis and design of Agent-Oriented Information Systems (AOISs) relates to the very same process using the multi-agent paradigm. A comprehensive and rigorous methodology for developing multi-agent systems is lacking (Elammari & Lalonde, 1999; Odell et al., 2000). Most existing multi-agent systems were developed in an ad-hoc manner, and systems developers paid little attention to requirements specification and the analysis process (Treur, 1999a).The paper has two goals: (a) to provide an overview and (b) to discuss challenges and future research of the field. To address the first goal, we review different methodologies that are suitable for analysing and designing AOIS. This is done by examining, for each methodology, its suitability in supporting the early phases of the software engineering process (specifically analysis and design) as well as its capabilities for modelling agent-oriented systems. To address the second goal, we analyse the limitations of existing approaches, identify critical issues and point to what we think are possible future directions.", "authors": ["Ofer Arazy", "Carson C.

These complex behaviors result from the simultaneous execution of simple rules at multiple local sites. A widely studied behavior consists of correctly determining the density of an initial configuration, and both human and computer-written rules have been found that perform with high efficiency at this task. However, the two best rules for the density-classification task, Coevolution1 and Coevolution2, were discovered using a coevolutionary algorithm in which a genetic algorithm evolved the rules and, therefore, only the output bits of the rules are known. However, to understand why these and other rules perform so well and how the information is transmitted throughout the cellular automata, the Boolean expressions that orchestrate this behavior must be known.

A new type of distributed consensus filters is designed, where each sensor can communicate with the neighboring sensors, and filtering can be performed in a distributed way.

{"abstract": "Distributed systems that span large geographic distances or manage large numbers of objects are already common place. In such systems, programming applications with even modest reliability requirements to run correctly and efficiently is a difficult task due to asynchrony and the possibility of complex failure scenarios. We describe the architecture of the RELACS communication subsystem that constitutes the microkernel of a layered approach to reliable computing in large-scale distributed systems. RELACS is designed to be highly portable and implements a very small number of abstractions and primitives that should be sufficient for building a variety of interesting higher-level paradigms. >", "authors": ["Ozalp Babaoglu", "R.

{"abstract": "We formulate the delay-tolerant networking routing problem, where messages are to be moved end-to-end across a connectivity graph that is time-varying but whose dynamics may be known in advance. The problem has the added constraints of finite buffers at each node and the general property that no contemporaneous end-to-end path may ever exist. This situation limits the applicability of traditional routing approaches that tend to treat outages as failures and seek to find an existing end-to-end path. We propose a framework for evaluating routing algorithms in such environments. We then develop several algorithms and use simulations to compare their performance with respect to the amount of knowledge they require about network topology. We find that, as expected, the algorithms using the least knowledge tend to perform poorly. We also find that with limited additional knowledge, far less than complete global knowledge, efficient algorithms can be constructed for routing in such environments.

In trying to learn enough about these distributions to settle the question, I found a rich and long history, spanning many fields. Indeed, several recently proposed models from the computer science community have antecedents in work from decades ago. Here, I briefly survey some of this history, focusing on underlying generative models that lead to these distributions.

{"abstract": "Despite the wide use of software product lines, their implementation and evolution is a challenging task. When implementing a feature, a developer has to know which code fragments of other (already implemented) features are accessible in each program variant in which the feature is included. Especially for composition-based implementation techniques, in which the code is implemented in separated modules, it is an exhausting and error-prone task to find safely accessible code fragments of other modules. State-of-the-art tool support, such as product-line type checkers, detect errors a posteriori (i.e., during compilation), but fails to prevent errors during the implementation. To overcome this problem, we propose  feature-context interfaces , which provide a modular and non-variable programming interface to the variable source code of a product line. These interfaces ease changes, extensions, and the maintainability of product lines. To demonstrate applicability, we implemented a content assist and an outline view in Eclipse based on feature-context interfaces. We evaluate the potential of our method by analyzing the number of potential type errors we prevent compared to state-of-the-art techniques.", "authors": ["Reimar Schr\u00f6ter", "Norbert Siegmund", "Thomas Th\u00fcm", "Gunter Saake"], "n_citation": 34, "references": ["02ce6911-5881-4439-80ff-ca13035c377c", "1cc4903c-21b2-4605-8402-e958f3f42b2e", "1f098e13-aad0-4e12-92fc-d02fdbb561b6", "28c49b78-9398-4832-baa9-0207cba36e12", "2f754e6d-e49c-4b53-b54f-c2208aeb19b5", "38de3564-fd80-48fe-9ba4-e69511574e12", "453be7f6-01f7-4344-bd3b-88985e688473", "48d2b75c-3ad4-4bd6-bb99-a62f142ec8f9", "6bb138d0-6fae-4bf3-b751-5ddae9e1dbe1", "6f63bfe9-a11a-4ef9-9fc7-99d844d2dd1f", "7acda742-346d-4e8b-8b2f-988be72b2fe4", "85461853-75fe-4d0d-a228-ae6283daa2f3", "a22b2d59-c3b0-4c74-b237-ce4d9e347cf0", "a6e2046a-9c0d-45dc-8781-5938d0ad41a0", "a944cc73-f4fd-4894-96f2-435537a56583", "aceea744-4387-448b-8b33-b3efac8a4193", "d03863f5-9e88-4d6f-901d-707673ff9ea2", "d2f82ebc-9a2a-45cd-ac18-dd5e70cf069d", "d3e106ec-ee90-4727-ab3a-50e9f69cfd13", "d959427a-c8e4-419f-ae9c-a2370a63e635", "dd676fcc-16b4-4077-bfca-6fb5573008b2", "f93e8bb9-ca32-4469-b26d-83159c422707", "fbab723e-0028-4406-a3a4-dcf27dd6554e"], "title": "Feature-context interfaces: tailored programming interfaces for software product lines", "venue": "software product lines", "year": 2014, "id": "3de6d0ec-2d49-4092-b77e-73c74f7aac27"}

{"abstract": "The TCP is a popular transport protocol used in the present-day Internet. When packet losses occur the TCP assumes that the packet losses are due to congestion, and responds by reducing its congestion window. When a TCP connection traverses a wireless link, a significant fraction of packet losses may occur due to transmission errors. The TCP responds to such losses also by reducing the congestion window. This results in unnecessary degradation in the TCP performance. We define a class of functions named loss predictors which may be used by a TCP sender to guess the actual cause of a packet loss (congestion or transmission error) and take appropriate actions. These loss predictors use simple statistics on round-trip times and/or throughput, to determine the cause of a packet loss. We investigate their ability to determine the cause of a packet loss.

Choosing a basis for the nonlinear Q-parameter yields a convex stochastic optimization problem, which can be solved by standard methods such as sampling. In principle (for a large enough basis, and enough sampling) this method can solve the controller design problem to any degree of accuracy; in any case it can be used to find a suboptimal controller, using convex optimization methods. We illustrate the method with a numerical example, comparing a nonlinear controller found using our method with the optimal linear controller, the certainty-equivalent model predictive controller, and a lower bound on achievable performance obtained by ignoring the causality constraint.", "authors": ["Jo\u00eblle Skaf", "Stephen P.

{"abstract": "The problem we consider in this paper is to take a single two-dimensional image containing a human body, locate the joint positions, and use these to estimate the body configuration and pose in three-dimensional space. The basic approach is to store a number of exemplar 2D views of the human body in a variety of different configurations and viewpoints with respect to the camera. On each of these stored views, the locations of the body joints (left elbow, right knee, etc.) are manually marked and labelled for future use. The test shape is then matched to each stored view, using the technique of shape context matching in conjunction with a kinematic chain-based deformation model. Assuming that there is a stored view sufficiently similar in configuration and pose, the correspondence process will succeed. The locations of the body joints are then transferred from the exemplar view to the test shape. Given the joint locations, the 3D body configuration and pose are then estimated.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a new approach for digital watermarking and secure copyright protection of videos, the principal aim being to discourage illicit copying and distribution of copyrighted material. The method presented here is based on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of three dimensional chunks of video scene, in contrast with previous works on video watermarking where each video frame was marked separately, or where only intra-frame or motion compensation parameters were marked in MPEG compressed videos. Two kinds of information are hidden in the video: a watermark and a template. Both are encoded using an owner key to ensure the system security and are embedded in the 3D DFT magnitude of video chunks. The watermark is a copyright information encoded in the form of a spread spectrum signal. The template is a key based grid and is used to detect and invert the effect of frame-rate changes, aspect-ratio modification and rescaling of frames. The template search and matching is performed in the log-log-log map of the 3D DFT magnitude. The performance of the presented technique is evaluated experimentally and compared with a frame-by-frame 2D DFT watermarking approach.", "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Deguillaume", "Gabriela Otilia Csurka", "Jos\u00e9ph John O'Ruanaidh", "Thierry Pun"], "n_citation": 205, "title": "Robust 3D DFT video watermarking", "venue": "", "year": 1999, "id": "758d336c-250e-4248-91ff-aae9d76d8398"}
{"abstract": "While clustering is usually an unsupervised operation, there are circumstances in which we believe (with varying degrees of certainty) that items A and B should be assigned to the same cluster, while items A and C should not. We would like such pairwise relations to influence cluster assignments of out-of-sample data in a manner consistent with the prior knowledge expressed in the training set. Our starting point is probabilistic clustering based on Gaussian mixture models (GMM) of the data distribution. We express clustering preferences in the prior distribution over assignments of data points to clusters. This prior penalizes cluster assignments according to the degree with which they violate the preferences. We fit the model parameters with EM. Experiments on a variety of data sets show that PPC can consistently improve clustering results.", "authors": ["Zhengdong Lu", "Todd K.

{"abstract": "In this work, we investigate eye movement analysis as a new sensing modality for activity recognition. Eye movement data were recorded using an electrooculography (EOG) system. We first describe and evaluate algorithms for detecting three eye movement characteristics from EOG signals-saccades, fixations, and blinks-and propose a method for assessing repetitive patterns of eye movements. We then devise 90 different features based on these characteristics and select a subset of them using minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR) feature selection. We validate the method using an eight participant study in an office environment using an example set of five activity classes: copying a text, reading a printed paper, taking handwritten notes, watching a video, and browsing the Web. We also include periods with no specific activity (the NULL class). Using a support vector machine (SVM) classifier and person-independent (leave-one-person-out) training, we obtain an average precision of 76.1 percent and recall of 70.5 percent over all classes and participants.

{"abstract": "Within an increasing number of domains an important emerging need is the ability for technically naive users to compose computational elements into novel configurations. Examples include astronomers who create new analysis pipelines to process telescopic data, intelligence analysts who must process diverse sources of unstructured text to discover socio-technical trends, and medical researchers who have to process brain image data in new ways to understand disease pathways. Creating such compositions today typically requires low-level technical expertise, limiting the use of computational methods and increasing the cost of using them. In this paper we describe an approach -- which we term end-user architecting -- that exploits the similarity between such compositional activities and those of software architects. Drawing on the rich heritage of software architecture languages, methods, and tools, we show how those techniques can be adapted to support end users in composing rich computational systems through domain-specific compositional paradigms and component repositories, without requiring that they have knowledge of the low-level implementation details of the components or the compositional infrastructure. Further, we outline a set of open research challenges that the area of end-user architecting raises.", "authors": ["David Garlan", "Vishal Dwivedi", "Ivan Ruchkin", "Bradley R.

{"abstract": "This paper focuses on distributed task allocation mechanisms in Open Multi-Agents Systems. Our aim is to provide task allocation protocols for building Multi-Agents Systems in distributed environments. The mechanism we propose is based on a Group Self-Design (GSD) approach. From a global point of view the GSD protocols enable the search space to be organised into a tree-structure in which nodes are agent groups. From a local point of view they enable a group to be sub-divided autonomously and independently of the others. The purpose of GSD is to limit the network load created by the management of the system dynamic and by the search of task solvers. We put forward an evaluation of our approach in terms of network load in relation to the contract net protocol of R.G. Smith (1980) and to the agent group model of B. Dillenseger and F.

{"abstract": "As the Internet services spread all over the world, many kinds and a large number of security threats are increasing. Therefore, intrusion detection systems, which can effectively detect intrusion accesses, have attracted attention. This paper describes a novel fuzzy class-association-rule mining method based on genetic network programming (GNP) for detecting network intrusions. GNP is an evolutionary optimization technique, which uses directed graph structures instead of strings in genetic algorithm or trees in genetic programming, which leads to enhancing the representation ability with compact programs derived from the reusability of nodes in a graph structure. By combining fuzzy set theory with GNP, the proposed method can deal with the mixed database that contains both discrete and continuous attributes and also extract many important class-association rules that contribute to enhancing detection ability. Therefore, the proposed method can be flexibly applied to both misuse and anomaly detection in network-intrusion-detection problems. Experimental results with KDD99Cup and DARPA98 databases from MIT Lincoln Laboratory show that the proposed method provides competitively high detection rates compared with other machine-learning techniques and GNP with crisp data mining.", "authors": ["Shingo Mabu", "Ci Chen", "Nannan Lu", "Kaoru Shimada", "Kotaro Hirasawa"], "n_citation": 136, "references": ["10839b39-dd88-4047-a2fa-dad3b609c4d2", "1e2e60aa-7b98-44b0-b263-83b0ead84dce", "6ce2a644-1c2e-45cb-8453-2c702e9fb06e", "6ec77786-3d9a-40f0-a72d-5b9ddee86fbe", "730d0343-e379-4752-84c2-4028a3afda6c", "78fb5556-8f9a-4879-bbff-b264981f080e", "8aec3e23-d98e-4733-b8ce-55176cee643a", "b1b50806-f61b-47dd-a472-08b6fd41a73b", "b81b0bf5-56b6-4b02-875c-bd0175ee2f56", "b869c67e-3995-4843-8ebf-c63c0e7e6013", "d48cfad8-9512-4999-b5e6-695f4995aaa5", "d9da3706-1a29-426f-91c0-fc6d037190f3", "e5182530-62fd-493a-a52d-8095431d105a", "ec129a04-1877-4223-9669-ec6921cf75af", "ee94781a-5e9d-4620-a8e9-d5e23fbc2ad6"], "title": "An Intrusion-Detection Model Based on Fuzzy Class-Association-Rule Mining Using Genetic Network Programming", "venue": "systems man and cybernetics", "year": 2011, "id": "deb5073d-0740-4edb-b61a-c715037c1fca"}
{"abstract": "Tactile sensation is essential for many exploration and manipulation tasks not only in a real environment but also in a virtual environment. We suggest the design of an integrated tactile display system that provides kinesthetic force, pressure distribution, vibration and slip/stretch. The system consists of two parts: a 2 DOF force feedback device for kinesthetic display and a tactile feedback device for displaying the normal stimulation to the skin and the skin slip/stretch. Psychophysical experiments measure the effects of fingerpad selection, the direction of finger movements and the texture width on tactile sensitivity. We also investigate the characteristics of lateral finger movement while subjects perceive different textures. From the experimental results, the principal parameters for designing a tactile display are suggested. A tactile display device, using eight piezoelectric bimorphs and a linear actuator, is implemented and attached to a 2 DOF translational force feedback device to simultaneously simulate the texture and stiffness of the object. As a result, we find out that the capability of the suggested device is sufficient to display physical quantities for tactile sensing.", "authors": ["Ki-Uk Kyung", "Seung-Woo Son", "Dong-Soo Kwon", "Munsang Kim"], "n_citation": 34, "references": ["6aa23453-e19c-4b7b-a649-366a857b705f", "6be239c9-a69b-423a-866d-9286d0a2fb66", "bc11dc5f-7bb1-46a4-a249-d000f0e30e37"], "title": "Design of an integrated tactile display system", "venue": "international conference on robotics and automation", "year": 2004, "id": "41d47f1e-268c-44f3-b440-f25d5639fad8"}

{"abstract": "Extremum seeking (ES) using deterministic periodic perturbations has been an effective method for non-model based real time optimization when only limited plant knowledge is available. However, periodicity can naturally lead to predictability which is undesirable in some tracking applications and unrepresentative of biological optimization processes such as bacterial chemotaxis. With this in mind, it is useful to investigate employing stochastic perturbations in the context of a typical ES architecture, and to compare the approach with existing stochastic optimization techniques. In this work, we show that convergence towards the extremum of a static map can be guaranteed with a stochastic ES algorithm, and quantify the behavior of a system with Gaussian-distributed perturbations at the extremum in terms of the ES constants and map parameters. We then examine the closed loop system when actuator dynamics are included, as the separation of time scales between the perturbation signal and plant dynamics recommended in periodic ES schemes cannot be guaranteed with stochastic perturbations. Consequently, we investigate how actuator dynamics influence the allowable range of ES parameters and necessitate changes in the closed loop structure. Finally simulation results are presented to demonstrate convergence and to validate predicted behavior about the extremum. For the sake of analogy with the classical methods of stochastic approximation, stochastic ES in this technical note is pursued in discrete time.", "authors": ["Chris Manzie", "Miroslav Krstic"], "n_citation": 86, "references": ["5e3d7bf0-35a7-433f-802c-2a129ee0a698", "c0f6aafb-7fc5-4a07-aeb9-ea5c0f181bb3", "e66d73b0-abb9-4693-864e-faec07c69738"], "title": "Extremum Seeking With Stochastic Perturbations", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "year": 2009, "id": "ad7d70bd-c9f3-4a36-94e8-3c2eb8089e4e"}

{"abstract": "Recent work has shown the value of using propositional SAT solvers, as opposed to pure BDD solvers, for solving many real-world Boolean Satisfiability prob- lems including Bounded Model Checking problems (BMC). We propose a SAT solver paradigm which combines the use of BDDs and search methods to support efficient implementation of complex search heuristics and effective use of early (preprocessor) learning. We implement many of these ideas in software called SBSAT. We show that SBSAT solves many of the benchmarks tested competitively or substantially faster than state-of-the-art SAT solvers. SBSAT differs from standard propositional SAT solvers by working directly with non- CNF propositional input; its input format is BDDs. This allows some BDD-style pro- cessing to be used as a preprocessing tool. After preprocessing, the BDDs are trans- formed into state machines (different state machines than the ones used in the original model checking problem) and a good deal of lookahead information is precomputed and memoized. This provides for fast implementation of a new form of lookahead, called local-function-complete lookahead (contrasting with the depth-first lookahead of zChaff (Moskewicz et al. 01) and the breadth-first lookahead of Prover (Stalmarck 94)). SBSAT provides a choice of search heuristics, allowing users to exploit domain-specific experience. We describe SBSAT in this paper. We use SBSAT in conjunction with the tool bmc from Carnegie Mellon to translate a bounded model checking problem to classical propositional logic and then use SBSAT to solve the bmc output. We show this approach is faster than the now traditional approach of translating the bmc output to CNF clauses and using a CNF-based SAT solver, such", "authors": ["John V.

{"abstract": "Aiming at detecting secret information hidden in a given image using steganographic tools, steganalysis has been of interest for years. In particular, universal steganalysis, not limited to attacking a specific steganographic tool, is of extensive interests due to its practicality. Recently, splicing detection, another important area in digital forensics has attracted increasing attention. Is there any relationship between steganalysis and splicing detection? Is it possible to apply universal steganalysis methodologies to splicing detection? In this paper, we address these intact and yet interesting questions. Our analysis and experiments have demonstrated that, on the one hand, steganography and splicing have different goals and strategies, hence, generally causing different statistical artifacts on images. However, on the other hand, both of them make the touched (stego or spliced) image different from the corresponding original (natural) image. Therefore, natural image model based on a set of carefully selected statistical features under the machine learning framework can be used for steganalysis and splicing detection. It is shown in this paper that some successful universal steganalytic schemes can make promising progress in splicing detection if applied properly. A more advanced natural image model developed from these state-of-the-art steganalysis methods is thereafter presented. Furthermore, a concrete implementation of the proposed model is applied to the Columbia Image Splicing Detection Evaluation Dataset, which has achieved an accuracy of 92%, indicating a significant advancement in splicing detection.", "authors": ["Yun Q.

{"abstract": "Research on multimedia information retrieval (MIR) has recently witnessed a booming interest. A prominent feature of this research trend is its simultaneous but independent materialization within several fields of computer science. The resulting richness of paradigms, methods and systems may, on the long run, result in a fragmentation of efforts and slow down progress. The primary goal of this study is to promote an integration of methods and techniques for MIR by contributing a conceptual model that encompasses in a unified and coherent perspective the many efforts that are being produced under the label of MIR. The model offers a retrieval capability that spans two media, text and images, but also several dimensions: form, content and structure. In this way, it reconciles similarity-based methods with semantics-based ones, providing the guidelines for the design of systems that are able to provide a generalized multimedia retrieval service, in which the existing forms of retrieval not only coexist, but can be combined in any desired manner. The model is formulated in terms of a fuzzy description logic, which plays a twofold role: (1) it directly models semantics-based retrieval, and (2) it offers an ideal framework for the integration of the multimedia and multidimensional aspects of retrieval mentioned above. The model also accounts for relevance feedback in both text and image retrieval, integrating known techniques for taking into account user judgments. The implementation of the model is addressed by presenting a decomposition technique that reduces query evaluation to the processing of simpler requests, each of which can be solved by means of widely known methods for text and image retrieval, and semantic processing. A prototype for multidimensional image retrieval is presented that shows this decomposition technique at work in a significant case.", "authors": ["Carlo Meghini", "Fabrizio Sebastiani", "Umberto Straccia"], "n_citation": 153, "references": ["04da4d50-4c05-4a8b-b48b-fd1cdeca343c", "0b44ebf7-4eae-409f-b741-b2db25325411", "0c2e35c2-5ebe-40e4-8e1c-196c67b35085", "13b91eb0-0857-4556-b32a-0f85a1cf43f6", "14bba136-a316-4f06-8d17-ede27def9d50", "16088d1a-5061-4460-a562-239f2c64854a", "17f01f85-4909-41b7-bafd-88939c01894a", "1b50dac7-ea9d-4b20-ab92-4b8e1ba12b50", "1b978417-c775-4777-bad6-ee3ee15f2025", "1ce7a9a3-91c4-45d6-984a-e1d240fd81aa", "1d53c20e-0525-4fbe-b3bb-7c67c25d7c40", "292bf0c4-63d9-49ec-b92c-c80af3981a2f", "32c98966-f9c7-470f-878f-dfa58254f49d", "33d6dabd-c086-4a6e-939a-c322b6ada724", "344d5541-2290-4784-8668-16b02df77430", "36324e2d-6eee-410e-9263-e91360e09146", "3f40573a-d0cf-489b-a9b4-c194e6d4d19b", "40210af3-8519-4083-8f9d-2f95bad926c7", "407954ac-5b24-408f-b111-c57ee378359a", "412e747b-defc-446b-a630-4747bd4a8572", "4380dfee-9c83-4f18-b4c9-c8687959aa90", "470a428f-5ed1-414f-8c80-e932b19cbc31", "499db771-59f9-4b42-a5a8-d2a305829d43", "4ff08b56-991a-41c2-aa31-9b94680a7b23", "504e2e5b-c6a7-4e27-a7c2-613c05a7302d", "514be85f-f551-488f-b69a-c03e4f8bad50", "5634e3fa-2958-400e-a54a-f1ed2bd77ce4", "56d6466f-28bc-429c-a969-9b9609398481", "57df6662-99b6-4103-aab3-8046828a4aba", "58110599-9a6d-44ba-9e5f-b9a92d52b820", "5aefb452-9252-406f-81ad-06d8f8f6d564", "5afe32d9-e991-41f9-ae82-ac8bdde6a4b6", "5b6620cd-3df0-4309-a24d-b120be89242c", "604fbfd2-84fc-49f0-b9d1-5021f77b2d2e", "61a0dc53-5dee-4fd1-a12e-e320196c50c5", "61f4870c-fdcd-4a86-933b-56ceb40f4f83", "62fb5087-5af2-4ea3-b4bc-9e2748e30203", "63a1e0be-afc5-413e-aa27-d3eb26a891ac", "67288135-af65-4979-99ef-75e7d603e190", "6774c38c-39dd-4ce5-a323-d292f31bb642", "69b0e6d2-1ca0-42e7-be50-3b17bc9b7da0", "6e8258e4-3a92-4a6b-9c6f-10c63a2060da", "707fdea7-fc59-4279-89af-6ae91e683358", "74f316d3-eac1-4968-abbe-cca232b8c446", "7d5ce3db-236e-4e66-afeb-15822f748afa", "8c2183ba-4b42-49ab-993c-238e9db9ee1d", "9202b5c5-aff7-4855-9211-272b9ec5011a", "991cb04a-06b1-4eba-9897-11ab86447c80", "a1029dd8-9ffa-4819-8d6f-87859c6adf83", "a1f39854-7705-4f3a-8598-5479ac4cdcf3", "a674e214-e773-4409-aeda-43b97abb9576", "b2bdd506-afeb-47df-bb37-d5352304ebda", "b5c047ac-58ce-4d0f-a212-504b4838b345", "b7452dc8-806a-484d-abd7-d2065e0e9db9", "b81b25dc-d608-492e-a12f-7c142f39cf33", "ba3dcfc0-e7ad-498a-bbbf-d02e5fab145e", "bb2f4922-fad1-498b-81bc-1cfad96b6b8f", "bee63b0d-8a59-4b4d-870d-3a94b936e925", "bf56425a-14bd-4d62-b98f-f59007edc9f8", "c8b99493-a3b0-4257-b7cd-0c0a73251f14", "c90ebce6-4f07-4ba8-b07c-b31dd8c64bcc", "ce044a5e-fc66-4693-8463-9917c4171b04", "ce356900-b262-417d-b881-b2cbba9a75cd", "d2affa8b-810c-47b1-8e45-cd9f7a929811", "d55b22d6-2cf2-48c2-ba9c-ae3cf440c3ad", "da361807-492c-4353-837f-0adb9a164be3", "e82109f9-480f-445c-b4d7-01ebdcd8dcf8", "f3f1d5e7-ead9-43cd-a210-fbed039d66b1", "f6a47146-c458-44af-8e19-e0a41b27971d", "f815f346-6707-4036-b766-0a0ca290809f", "fd85b7ab-ed2c-4020-816f-47cbf6d8d048", "fded92ab-9285-4dea-84b4-a56416164c5b"], "title": "A model of multimedia information retrieval", "venue": "Journal of the ACM", "year": 2001, "id": "c5fb64d6-a09e-4eef-a8a7-e24871d2c95a"}
{"abstract": "The problem of privacy-preserving data analysis has a long history spanning multiple disciplines. As electronic data about individuals becomes increasingly detailed, and as technology enables ever more powerful collection and curation of these data, the need increases for a robust, meaningful, and mathematically rigorous definition of privacy, together with a computationally rich class of algorithms that satisfy this definition. Differential Privacy is such a definition.After motivating and discussing the meaning of differential privacy, the preponderance of this monograph is devoted to fundamental techniques for achieving differential privacy, and application of these techniques in creative combinations, using the query-release problem as an ongoing example. A key point is that, by rethinking the computational goal, one can often obtain far better results than would be achieved by methodically replacing each step of a non-private computation with a differentially private implementation. Despite some astonishingly powerful computational results, there are still fundamental limitations \u2014 not just on what can be achieved with differential privacy but on what can be achieved with any method that protects against a complete breakdown in privacy. Virtually all the algorithms discussed herein maintain differential privacy against adversaries of arbitrary computational power. Certain algorithms are computationally intensive, others are efficient. Computational complexity for the adversary and the algorithm are both discussed.We then turn from fundamentals to applications other than queryrelease, discussing differentially private methods for mechanism design and machine learning. The vast majority of the literature on differentially private algorithms considers a single, static, database that is subject to many analyses. Differential privacy in other models, including distributed databases and computations on data streams is discussed.Finally, we note that this work is meant as a thorough introduction to the problems and techniques of differential privacy, but is not intended to be an exhaustive survey \u2014 there is by now a vast amount of work in differential privacy, and we can cover only a small portion of it.", "authors": ["Cynthia Dwork", "Aaron Roth"], "n_citation": 616, "references": ["020f301f-0531-4359-bee6-8c0433f8704d", "021ce112-7d61-4235-8dce-70cab2c4581f", "04465a9c-73ab-4f14-b09d-be7aa4d02ae1", "14a299be-49d3-4a6d-b180-35a8f77b8a07", "16ced640-b39f-4a2e-b0af-a549fad31c76", "1a2efcd4-020e-4e09-8b06-4d4f48564e60", "242be57a-2634-4f93-b69b-e89bf553d6b5", "2a4df8c4-87d6-485c-beef-5fd21a78bcbd", "2bb0aeeb-0e12-4a5f-916e-105c5f6c8ca8", "2cf410dd-361d-4f94-b15f-8af962994e29", "2e1ea835-8321-46d9-8653-4206006aa537", "32fd9fa0-0857-4bbc-8e40-b947c02e9d8b", "50e9490b-0b43-477e-ab7b-8622092541b4", "510a59fd-537c-4b09-8d02-4012ec0ad0ce", "538f5014-ee5e-4baa-9cb6-021b07baa42e", "560a50c6-7565-47ca-bbc1-98e379393962", "59620d42-e8f5-4079-900b-35d39cdc9ed9", "5b26d855-551c-47cc-be7b-0bb83b54efd7", "65876893-352c-4a60-9cd3-f83c2637f37e", "69836668-91be-4e1b-9721-492b90046b96", "6fd8c383-222a-4ebf-863f-80034a47b5a9", "70ee2599-0921-4a79-b87a-7fadceb4357d", "70f4dcf0-2784-4627-899c-1463988a3f52", "81929587-11ed-41a9-9c15-8f44e31f3737", "81eb333b-f853-4099-bccf-bbfc29ec6126", "906e594f-6682-4669-a0aa-745584917f7e", "99fd4205-aceb-4de0-a923-0897da5477b6", "9a9042ef-19fd-4cc4-90db-059122355179", "9bf9edab-975a-4e47-bdb2-523cd8fc9db1", "9ea538bf-105e-4089-83f3-058313bcfaf0", "a5d4bb55-12d6-47f8-82ff-499b31fb3104", "b0cc5040-4d3d-4981-9248-6aceee4a827c", "b0e8b92b-15ff-447b-80ff-12a52d57e270", "b4d01842-df3f-442a-9688-24ff9f476c91", "b8795a37-4227-4c2e-97f3-cb0110133e6e", "c478168a-dfc3-4bd5-bcf6-5af93de5d598", "d2fa95c8-8c8c-4772-8cfe-70507c1115e4", "da20fe4e-7a9c-4e78-a155-8fb311eb5883", "e78038fd-b069-4a96-aa27-7915f9a2af67", "f23e82b3-0ce5-4210-97f6-fcc4a906e814", "f6e345a5-8fc0-49da-891a-465f0234dc81", "f900e3cd-0c0b-4d9d-9c48-ddc896b39b75"], "title": "The Algorithmic Foundations of Differential Privacy", "venue": "Foundations and Trends in Theoretical Computer Science", "year": 2014, "id": "7c3addb9-6b68-48e6-a378-edbf90f4a6ef"}
{"abstract": "Star schema, which maintains one-to-many relationships between dimensions and a fact table, is widely accepted as the most viable data representation for dimensional analysis. Realworld DW schema, however, frequently includes many-to-many relationships between a dimension and a fact table. Having those relationships in a dimensional model causes several difficult issues, such as losing the simplicity of the star schema structure, increasing complexity in forming queries, and degrading query performance by adding more joins. Therefore, it is desirable to represent the many-to-many relationships with correct semantics while still keeping the structure of the star schema. In this paper, we analyze many-to-many relationships between a dimension table and a fact table in dimensional modeling. We illustrate six different approaches and show the advantages and disadvantages of each. We propose two ad-hoc methods that maintain a star schema structure by denormalizing the dimensions to avoid many-tomany relationships. This method allows quick query processing by using a concatenated attribute with minimal overhead. Other issues addressed are data redundancy, weighting factors, storage requirements, and performance concerns.", "authors": ["Il-Yeol Song", "William Rowen", "Carl Medsker", "Edward Ewen"], "n_citation": 43, "references": ["25b7fdf3-e5df-442e-b88b-df07db49f33b", "3ba733a0-e3e7-460e-ab97-b50fd0371fe9", "612d6ed7-b558-4376-b528-0ec8330d9619", "9660d528-73cf-48d5-a86c-862ad5a34717", "ad3f51c3-5fea-46f5-82e3-02f37e681641", "aeef9023-e739-495e-b573-c61ef8fb3524", "deeb354a-da47-4e45-b239-d34e29dce66f", "fb494195-93a5-407b-860b-f89e0fa41c78"], "title": "An Analysis of Many-to-Many Relationships Between Fact and Dimension Tables in Dimensional Modeling", "venue": "", "year": 2001, "id": "8c4740a5-a44f-414b-b1c3-d3327b035f70"}
{"abstract": "Test input generators using symbolic and concolic execution must solve path conditions to systematically explore a program and generate high coverage tests. However, path conditions may contain complicated arithmetic constraints that are infeasible to solve: a solver may be unavailable, solving may be computationally intractable, or the constraints may be undecidable. Existing test generators either simplify such constraints with concrete values to make them decidable, or rely on strong but incomplete constraint solvers. Unfortunately, simplification yields coarse approximations whose solutions rarely satisfy the original constraint. Moreover, constraint solvers cannot handle calls to native library methods. We show how a simple combination of linear constraint solving and heuristic search can overcome these limitations. We call this technique Concolic Walk. On a corpus of 11 programs, an instance of our Concolic Walk algorithm using tabu search generates tests with two- to three-times higher coverage than simplification-based tools while being up to five-times as efficient. Furthermore, our algorithm improves the coverage of two state-of-the-art test generators by 21% and 32%. Other concolic and symbolic testing tools could integrate our algorithm to solve complex path conditions without having to sacrifice any of their own capabilities, leading to higher overall coverage.", "authors": ["Peter Dinges", "Gul Agha"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0278bce3-e509-4ae6-b130-87a283a4b819", "0352cabb-a737-4277-b1c5-de27c97c52d8", "0fd5aa4c-c75c-4ea0-8d7d-b3e161691e4d", "1428f757-51e1-4de7-bb58-91917c0390b5", "17f18b76-6d78-4a60-88c9-02030b357558", "1e4e8925-3328-4af5-be88-56eef2f6aa8f", "22b8c128-376d-46c5-a3d2-1cd825afd3bf", "28bb9cc9-528c-4f1f-a76c-893d3a926c43", "312236d2-d0ef-4802-b85b-407cd3463dc3", "33b89292-d2d8-49e2-8b81-5c18e5dd6ab6", "3518522e-4720-4eac-af3d-3c41ccb2fb00", "3540f841-37e0-42fa-b384-e21d64571ce9", "3e96cb40-b163-4d97-815b-5398964a3fd9", "4056eb66-b7f6-49c0-b945-3a8ad61f300e", "46bd0711-73ea-4ced-8266-8976e251f5fc", "4ea5379a-3db3-4885-a5de-36d6d16a5c74", "5a2141d4-64ac-4e6c-acc0-1bd6e8f6fa0c", "6c4aa7fe-f5ce-461f-99fa-02087dde8ea4", "6ed980e4-82b6-467e-8f69-09882357a004", "705e8973-0f20-468a-a809-e9f85ca093ef", "71c47dd0-a7ff-4b97-a640-1186dd9ac968", "7c816204-72a6-43ca-a55e-5d1bfc4c4890", "8453e30e-f401-44db-b902-e352820c7551", "88e92677-1b43-4973-ae41-77d2db7bca77", "925d10bd-744b-4812-b6e9-13f7664dd0f4", "928c55e2-6649-4596-b983-17057894b30c", "968c4225-af90-4526-8f43-99ef4daf67fb", "98e22ff9-3d7f-4377-be70-a0c5861d7346", "9c7201ef-a788-41b9-a31d-dfa5bfa2fd93", "a331ae5b-4edc-4fd4-9b3b-4dfb1f297c21", "a4f92198-9c9a-44a7-af87-d8fa19cf934c", "a5aca376-87e3-4cf9-b0ab-76f37721cd9b", "b24d08c6-05fa-47dd-bbdb-9f09003d6a41", "c810f3ed-2446-4332-9134-a7d43aa25333", "d84fe9e1-732c-4408-84ac-3e07d5f90790", "d90b9f75-4773-4402-8712-73b2e7eed389", "dfd5088d-f088-4e67-bf4c-445184ce6a45", "f0af8bb9-445b-4cea-a64f-f564246ba8b2", "f4acaf30-f596-4cce-beaa-14d1a8d4fbed", "fdf1404d-8e94-489d-a8dc-d9a46f41a742"], "title": "Solving complex path conditions through heuristic search on induced polytopes", "venue": "foundations of software engineering", "year": 2014, "id": "5a0d366e-6cd8-4f05-836e-ac0a3a7f0c82"}

Postulating an aggregator function as the fundamental expression of tastes, we explore conditions under which a utility function can be constructed. We also modify the usual dynamic programming arguments to include this class of models. We show that Bellman's equation still holds, so many results known for the additively separable case can be generalized for this general description of preferences. Our approach is general, allowing for both bounded and unbounded (above/below) returns.

{"abstract": "Embedded control systems typically comprise continuous control laws combined with discrete mode logic. These systems are modeled using a hybrid automaton formalism, which is obtained by combining the discrete transition system formalism with continuous dynamical systems. This paper develops automated analysis techniques for asserting correctness of hybrid system designs. Our approach is based on symbolic representation of the state space of the system using mathematical formulas in an appropriate logic. Such formulas are manipulated using symbolic theorem proving techniques. It is important that formal analysis should be unobtrusive and acceptable to engineering practice. We motivate a methodology called invisible formal methods that provides a graded sequence of formal analysis technologies ranging from extended typechecking, through approximation and abstraction, to model checking and theorem proving. As an instance of invisible formal methods, we describe techniques to check inductive invariants, or extended types, for hybrid systems and compute discrete finite state abstractions automatically to perform reachability set computation. The abstract system is sound with respect to the formal semantics of hybrid automata. We also discuss techniques for performing analysis on nonstandard semantics of hybrid automata. We also briefly discuss the problem of translating models in Simulink/Stateflow language, which is widely used in practice, into the modeling formalisms, like hybrid automata, for which analysis tools are being developed.", "authors": ["Ashish Tiwari", "Natarajan Shankar", "John Rushby"], "n_citation": 66, "references": ["0d261b6a-c94a-4d5e-b44e-eb6ae46581fc", "137b1995-38f0-4891-b398-f88e21631391", "241340ef-9225-48ca-9ea0-c248444d055c", "3c0d5706-608d-40d2-9cdc-5adc093c6ce2", "4f68a351-cecd-471f-885e-59e6ff7c82c2", "6cff68d3-e0a1-4647-baf5-bd916bffa531", "70d19e95-2818-4683-8f4e-8e324be5d245", "a2ed9850-9822-42e1-8fcb-099be757a1ff", "b3369e47-4d8a-4ddc-a9b4-e30f4ff1234a", "bb28e8ef-624e-44cc-a791-53152af76e4d", "be6d0b65-17df-479f-806b-7540a3e8aab3", "cc403335-ba2c-4cdb-bc14-a8d15f36dcff", "d8f45444-76c1-4b84-b909-918211b4bab4", "dc990b06-f53f-4826-908d-c974bcb1227b", "ee15d060-4fd1-4b60-93a1-8535ac04292f"], "title": "Invisible formal methods for embedded control systems", "venue": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "year": 2003, "id": "473ee50a-5e2e-41a3-98d1-52883945f977"}

There is no more critical need for information sharing than during an international crisis, when international coalitions dynamically form. In the event of a crisis, whether it is humanitarian relief, natural disaster, combat operations, or terrorist incidents, international coalitions have an immediate need for information. These coalitions are formed with international cooperation, where each participating country offers whatever resources it can muster to support the given crisis. These situations can occur suddenly, simultaneously, and without warning. Often times, participants are coalition partners in one crisis and adversaries in another, raising difficult security issues with respect to information sharing. Our specific interest is in the Dynamic Coalition Problem (DCP), with an emphasis on the information sharing and security risks when coalitions are formed in response to a crisis.

{"abstract": "A massive volume of biological sequence data is available in over 36 different databases worldwide, including the sequence data generated by the Human Genome project. These databases, which also contain biological and bibliographical information, are growing at an exponential rate. Consequently, the computational demands needed to explore and analyze the data contained in these databases is quickly becoming a great concern. To meet these demands, we must use high performance computing systems, such as parallel computers and distributed networks of workstations. We present two parallel computational methods for analyzing these biological sequences. The first method is used to retrieve sequences that are homologous to a query sequence. The biological information associated with the homologous sequences found in the database may provide important clues to the structure and function of the query sequence. The second method, which helps in the prediction of the function, structure, and evolutionary history of biological sequences, is used to align a number of homologous sequences with each other. These two parallel computational methods were implemented and evaluated on an Intel IPSC/860 parallel computer. The resulting performance demonstrates that parallel computational methods can significantly reduce the computational time needed to analyze the sequences contained in large databases.", "authors": ["Tieng K.

We introduce the notion of shared operational semantics. It consists of an equation-based system of partial definitions and it is used as a tool for knowledge exchange between independently built databases. This semantics augments the earlier developed semantics for rules used as attribute definitions.

{"abstract": "Cloud computing provides users an efficient way to dynamically allocate computing resources to meet demands. Cloud providers can offer users two payment plans, i.e., reservation and on-demand plans for resource provisioning. Price of resources in reservation plan is generally cheaper than that in on-demand plan. However, since the reservation plan has to be acquired in advance, it may not fully meet future demands in which the on-demand plan can be used to guarantee the availability to the user. In this paper, we propose an optimal virtual machine placement (OVMP) algorithm. This algorithm can minimize the cost spending in each plan for hosting virtual machines in a multiple cloud provider environment under future demand and price uncertainty. OVMP algorithm makes a decision based on the optimal solution of stochastic integer programming (SIP) to rent resources from cloud providers.

{"abstract": "Maintainers face the daunting task of wading through a collection of both new and old revisions, trying to ferret out revisions which warrant personal inspection. One can rank revisions by size/lines of code (LOC), but often, due to the distribution of the size of changes, revisions will be of similar size. If we can't rank revisions by LOC perhaps we can rank by Halstead's and McCabe's complexity metrics? However, these metrics are problematic when applied to code fragments (revisions) written in multiple languages: special parsers are required which may not support the language or dialect used; analysis tools may not understand code fragments. We propose using the statistical moments of indentation as a lightweight, language independent, revision/diff friendly metric which actually proxies classical complexity metrics. We have extensively evaluated our approach against the entire CVS histories of the 278 of the most popular and most active SourceForge projects. We found that our results are linearly correlated and rank-correlated with traditional measures of complexity, suggesting that measuring indentation is a cheap and accurate proxy for code complexity of revisions. Thus ranking revisions by the standard deviation and summation of indentation will be very similar to ranking revisions by complexity.", "authors": ["Abram Hindle", "Michael W. Godfrey", "Richard C.

{"abstract": "This work affirms that the quantification of life-critical software reliability is infeasible using statistical methods, whether these methods are applied to standard software or fault-tolerant software. The classical methods of estimating reliability are shown to lead to exorbitant amounts of testing when applied to life-critical software. Reliability growth models are examined and also shown to be incapable of overcoming the need for excessive amounts of testing. The key assumption of software fault tolerance-separately programmed versions fail independently-is shown to be problematic. This assumption cannot be justified by experimentation in the ultrareliability region, and subjective arguments in its favor are not sufficiently strong to justify it as an axiom. Also, the implications of the recent multiversion software experiments support this affirmation. >", "authors": ["Ricky W. Butler", "George B.

{"abstract": "Given an information flow consisting of the flow path and the flow condition under which the flow takes place, the problem of determining whether the information flow is legal is considered; that is, whether the flow complies with the underlying nondiscretionary security policy of a trusted computing base (TCB). It is shown that the proposed approach to information-flow analysis has the advantage of eliminating the possibility of generating false illegal flow, namely flows that are identified by the analysis process to be illegal but which, in reality, are legal. Without eliminating false illegal flows from analysis, automated tools for secure information-flow analysis would be of limited use in this area because manual work would still be needed. Finally, it is shown how to apply this information-flow analysis approach to Secure XENIX and how information-flow analysis can help reduce the amount of effort for information-flow integration within TCB programs. >", "authors": ["Jingsha He", "Virgil D.

In this paper, we describe the first reputation system which incorporates both user-individual personalization and global experiences of peers in the network, for the distributed computation of reputation values. We also present a secure method to compute global trust values, thus assuring identification and isolation of malicious peers.

{"abstract": "Retiming, introduced by Leiserson and Saxe (1983, 1991), is a powerful transformation of circuits that preserves functionality and improves performance. The ASTRA algorithm proposed an alternative view of retiming using the equivalence between retiming and clock skew optimization and also presented a fast algorithm for minimum period (minperiod) retiming. Since minperiod retiming may significantly increase the number of flip-flops in the circuit, minimum area (minarea) retiming is an important problem. Minarea retiming is a much harder problem than minperiod retiming, and previous techniques were not capable of handling large circuits in a reasonable time. This work defines the relationship between the Leiserson-Saxe and the ASTRA approaches and utilizes it for efficient minarea retiming of large circuits. The new algorithm, Minaret, uses the same basis as the Leiserson-Saxe approach. The underlying philosophy of the ASTRA approach is incorporated to reduce the number of variables and constraints generated in the problem.

The energy management schemes addressed are state of the art and are most commonly used energy management techniques in fuel-cell vehicle applications, and they include the following: the state machine control strategy, the rule-based fuzzy logic strategy, the classical proportional-integral control strategy, the frequency decoupling/fuzzy logic control strategy, and the equivalent consumption minimization strategy. The main criteria for performance comparison are the hydrogen consumption, the state of charges of the batteries/supercapacitors, and the overall system efficiency. Moreover, the stresses on each energy source, which impact their life cycle, are measured using a new approach based on the wavelet transform of their instantaneous power.

RSTP offers faster convergence than STP but uses a single tree for the entire network. In order to achieve a better utilization of the network links, MSTP supports multiple spanning trees, one tree per VLAN group. However, MSTP does not provide efficient methods to build those spanning trees. Furthermore, MSTP does not provide methods to perform efficient VLAN-Spanning-Tree Mapping. Operators must manually provision this mapping which might seriously impact OPEX and network performance. In this paper, we propose very simple and yet easy to use spanning tree generation and mapping algorithms; which can be used to extend and/or work with the 802.1s MSTP. We show that these algorithms yield optimal bandwidth utilization and enhanced network throughput compared to existing methods.", "authors": ["Aref Meddeb"], "n_citation": 8, "references": ["f0c4b371-2951-4956-8348-a05c2e34bca4"], "title": "NGL01-3: Multiple Spanning Tree Generation and Mapping Algorithms for Carrier Class Ethernets", "venue": "global communications conference", "year": 2006, "id": "9c9c7011-b862-4708-bef1-a5488d6c1ae8"}

{"abstract": "Despite the continuous advances in the fields of intelligent control and computing, the design and deployment of efficient large scale nonlinear control systems (LNCSs) requires a tedious fine-tuning of the LNCS parameters before and during the actual system operation. In the majority of LNCSs the fine-tuning process is performed by experienced personnel based on field observations via experimentation with different combinations of controller parameters, without the use of a systematic approach. The existing adaptive/neural/fuzzy control methodologies cannot be used towards the development of a systematic, automated fine-tuning procedure for general LNCS due to the strict assumptions they impose on the controlled system dynamics; on the other hand, adaptive optimization methodologies fail to guarantee an efficient and safe performance during the fine-tuning process, mainly due to the fact that these methodologies involve the use of random perturbations. In this paper, we introduce and analyze, both by means of mathematical arguments and simulation experiments, a new learning/adaptive algorithm that can provide with convergent, an efficient and safe fine-tuning of general LNCS. The proposed algorithm consists of a combination of two different algorithms proposed by Kosmatopoulos (2007 and 2008) and the incremental-extreme learning machine neural networks (I-ELM-NNs). Among the nice properties of the proposed algorithm is that it significantly outperforms the algorithms proposed by Kosmatopoulos as well as other existing adaptive optimization algorithms. Moreover, contrary to the algorithms proposed by Kosmatopoulos , the proposed algorithm can operate efficiently in the case where the exogenous system inputs (e.g., disturbances, commands, demand, etc.) are unbounded signals.", "authors": ["Elias B.

{"abstract": "In this paper, the application of model predictive control (MPC) for high-performance speed control and torsional vibration suppression in the drive system with flexible coupling is demonstrated. The control methodology presented in this paper relies on incorporating the drive's safety and physical limitations directly into the control problem formulation so that future constraint violations are anticipated and prevented. In order to reduce the computational complexity, the standard MPC controller is replaced by its explicit form.

{"abstract": "Machine learning strongly relies on the covering test to assess whether a candidate hypothesis covers training examples. The present paper investigates learning relational concepts from examples, termed  relational learning  or  inductive logic programming . In particular, it investigates the chances of success and the computational cost of relational learning, which appears to be severely affected by the presence of a phase transition in the covering test. To this aim, three up-to-date relational learners have been applied to a wide range of artificial, fully relational learning problems. A first experimental observation is that the phase transition behaves as an attractor for relational learning; no matter which region the learning problem belongs to, all three learners produce hypotheses lying within or close to the phase transition region. Second, a  failure region  appears. All three learners fail to learn any accurate hypothesis in this region. Quite surprisingly, the probability of failure does not systematically increase with the size of the underlying target concept: under some circumstances, longer concepts may be easier to accurately approximate than shorter ones.

{"abstract": "We study the problem of an apprentice learning to behave in an environment with an unknown reward function by observing the behavior of an expert. We follow on the work of Abbeel and Ng [1] who considered a framework in which the true reward function is assumed to be a linear combination of a set of known and observable features. We give a new algorithm that, like theirs, is guaranteed to learn a policy that is nearly as good as the expert's, given enough examples. However, unlike their algorithm, we show that ours may produce a policy that is substantially better than the expert's. Moreover, our algorithm is computationally faster, is easier to implement, and can be applied even in the absence of an expert. The method is based on a game-theoretic view of the problem, which leads naturally to a direct application of the multiplicative-weights algorithm of Freund and Schapire [2] for playing repeated matrix games. In addition to our formal presentation and analysis of the new algorithm, we sketch how the method can be applied when the transition function itself is unknown, and we provide an experimental demonstration of the algorithm on a toy video-game environment.", "authors": ["Umar Syed", "Robert E.

{"abstract": "Conventional CMOS memory i.e., Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) has been the popular choice for embedded memory application for last several decades. However, SRAM seems to be approaching a brick wall. On one hand process variability and leakage power is posing severe obstruction towards SRAM scaling to future nodes and on the other hand, emerging energy-constrained and bandwidth hungry electronic gadgets demand for larger as well as energy-efficient on-chip cache which cannot be satisfied with SRAM. To address the changing landscape of consumer market, there is a corresponding need of changing the design paradigm. What is really needed is a memory technology that is at least 50-100X denser, 1000X energy-efficient and as fast as SRAM. Several emerging memory technologies are on the horizon but there is no clear universal choice for embedded application. This tutorial will explore the latest trends in the embedded memory segment and discuss the fundamental limitations of SRAM in meeting the new needs of the electronic systems. The complex (and not very well understood) interrelationships between memory density, bandwidth, latency, power and speed will be elaborated in the context of emerging graphics applications. Next the tutorial will discuss few promising emerging memory technologies where storage element is based on charge, spin and resistance. Specifically, the tutorial will focus on the operating principles, design challenges and solutions of volatile memory such as embedded Dynamic Random Access Memory (eDRAM) and non-volatile memories (NVM) such as Domain Wall Memory (DWM) and memrister. The eDRAM section of the tutorial will present the trade-offs such as low-power peripherals (e.g., wordline driver, sense amplifier) and its impact on random access time (tRC) and retention. The relationship between noise sources (e.g., process variations, coupling effects) and retention power will also be described. Design techniques such as pulsed sense amplifier, peripheral sleep etc. will be introduced to control and mitigate the effect of noise in high speed eDRAM arrays for future technology nodes. Next the tutorial will describe DWM which is a spin-based memory technology. Various design metrics such as read/write power, speed, reliability and retention will be discussed in detail. The tutorial will address the modeling and simulation methodology for design and analysis of DWM arrays. Various design challenges such as reliable shift circuitry, positioning of read/write head, impact of process variations on sense margin, reliability of nanowire etc. will be described. Design techniques to improve robustness, operating speed and array density will also be presented. The last part of this tutorial will describe memrister where the storage element is resistive in nature. Typically memrister suffer from high access power. Design techniques to lower the power consumption such as data encoding, write pause etc. will be discussed to mitigate the power while maintaining required robustness. The audiences will be able to takeaway following key points from this tutorial (a) changing landscape of emerging electronic systems and inability of SRAM to cater to these new needs in scaled technologies, (b) emerging memory technologies for embedded applications and their relative merits in terms of density, power, speed and reliability, (c) design methodologies, challenges and potential solutions to enable these emerging memories for embedded applications.", "authors": ["Swaroop Ghosh"], "n_citation": 1, "title": "Tutorial T6B: Embedded Memory Design for Future Technologies: Challenges and Solutions", "venue": "international conference on vlsi design", "year": 2014, "id": "34e674b5-c91f-4e43-a7d6-fdce80183b79"}
{"abstract": "A firewall is often placed at the entrance of each private network in the Internet. The function of a firewall is to examine each packet that passes through the entrance and decide whether to accept the packet and allow it to proceed or to discard the packet. A firewall is usually designed as a sequence of rules. To make a decision concerning some packets, the firewall rules are compared, one by one, with the packet until one rule is found to be satisfied by the packet: this rule determines the fate of the packet. We present the first ever method for designing the sequence of rules in a firewall to be consistent, complete, and compact. Consistency means that the rules are ordered correctly, completeness means that every packet satisfies at least one rule in the firewall, and compactness means that the firewall has no redundant rules. Our method starts by designing a firewall decision diagram (FDD, for short) whose consistency and completeness can be checked systematically (by an algorithm). We then apply a sequence of five algorithms to this FDD to generate, reduce and simplify the target firewall rules while maintaining the consistency and completeness of the original FDD.", "authors": ["Mohamed G.

{"abstract": "We analyze the problem faced by companies that rely on TL (Truckload) and LTL (Less than Truckload) carriers for the distribution of products across their supply chain. Our goal is to design simple inventory policies and transportation strategies to satisfy time varying demands over a finite horizon, while minimizing system wide cost by taking advantage of quantity discounts in the transportation cost structures. For this purpose, we study the cost effectiveness of restricting the inventory policies to the class of zero-inventory-ordering (ZIO) policies in a single-warehouse multiretailer scenario in which the warehouse serves as a cross-dock facility. In particular, we demonstrate that there exists a ZIO inventory policy whose total inventory and transportation cost is no more than 4/3 (5.6/4.6 if transportation costs are stationary) times the optimal cost. However, finding the best ZIO policy is an NP hard problem as well. Thus, we propose two algorithms to find an effective ZIO policy: An exact algorithm whose running time is polynomial for any fixed number of retailers, and a linear-programming-based heuristic whose effectiveness is demonstrated in a series of computational experiments. Finally, we extend the worst-case results developed in this paper to systems in which the warehouse does hold inventory.", "authors": ["Lap Mui Ann Chan", "Ana Muriel", "Zuo-Jun Max Shen", "David Simchi-Levi", "Chung-Piaw Teo"], "n_citation": 173, "references": ["10209665-5425-4e50-a127-fb7c8568d75c", "94718cf5-ab1a-4b60-a25c-d6be0441f68f", "a18e4afc-2829-4bcf-8f22-7b99658ba79f", "d3d6b7bf-141c-4f2f-a879-f9124d050888"], "title": "Effective Zero-Inventory-Ordering Policies for the Single-Warehouse Multiretailer Problem with Piecewise Linear Cost Structures", "venue": "Management Science", "year": 2002, "id": "662dac61-0630-4426-93a8-b05bf3cebf87"}
{"abstract": "A common way to address scalability requirements of distributed services is to employ server replication and client caching of objects that encapsulate the service state. The performance of such a system could depend very much on the protocol implemented by the system to maintain consistency among object copies. We explore scalable consistency protocols that never require synchronization and communication between all nodes that have copies of related objects. We achieve this by developing a novel approach called local consistency (LC). LC based protocols can provide increased flexibility and efficiency by allowing nodes control over how and when they become aware of updates to cached objects. We develop two protocols for implementing strong consistency using this approach and demonstrate that they scale better than a traditional invalidation based consistency protocol along the system load and geographic distribution dimensions of scale.", "authors": ["Mustaque Ahamad"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["051575e8-d58d-4812-9a3c-59c31b1c3c49", "13d2ada5-5f08-4349-9794-d4eaa407166e", "15315beb-6cf9-43c5-9090-41b31ac8b39f", "35b671b4-5e95-4a09-bae3-f0d94e648119", "4f7c3a78-2667-4dc4-90a4-620c3839a8d2", "5520e73e-d943-43fd-a6f2-88032a1ee589", "5eeb077a-57f1-449b-9347-fcfdd7311222", "5ef1d3b1-f564-4b7c-b518-9cc8a768c9dd", "65408f45-0f87-4a17-8843-a998e0c92e04", "699ec16c-51b9-4ecb-8b46-6b74db9337fb", "6b36c1e4-5377-49da-a572-5d61005f09dd", "73ce6975-bb2c-4d2f-b18e-eba774aded61", "778edfdc-6bfc-42a7-90d5-24284cc852dd", "7a7ca90e-5596-47e6-b01a-6f9bdc4288e7", "80ddf92e-1f28-42c9-a75b-8e7317439f08", "81e0c8c3-f275-4b31-926d-0a3dc185c4b8", "870b655d-408c-4e98-87be-8a83bf1e27e0", "8849ada7-9c38-4cac-9fd4-1c0d7a73be6e", "a8e6ee94-94fa-462b-bdb3-640e4735eb2b", "b223232a-17f7-429c-9e30-98b92f51ef2c", "b6d186c6-8f2c-4ee1-9017-a54512a51fba", "c7fff02d-3e77-4578-93f1-5b99e8c3c692", "cd34a690-50bf-481f-8b31-d06e5ebbd3d2", "ddda4cca-8fb5-4518-a1cd-c66aba4cbea1", "e5aaf37e-3ee1-41eb-9de5-7a996e1ccce6"], "title": "Scalable consistency protocols for distributed services", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems", "year": 1999, "id": "2c53be85-6f92-4948-aad6-26089c59d21a"}
{"abstract": "Cognitive radio (CR) emerges as a key technology to enhance spectrum efficiency and thus creates opportunistic transmissions over links. Supporting the routing function on top of numerous opportunistic links is a must to route packets in a general cognitive radio network (CRN) consisting of multi-radio systems. However, there lacks complete understanding of these highly dynamic available links and a reliable end-to-end transportation mechanism over CRN. Aspiring to meet this need, we propose novel spectrum aware opportunistic routing (SAOR) algorithm suited for the CRN under wireless fading channels. With innovative establishment of the spectrum map from local sensing information and the derivation of the routing metric for opportunistic links known as opportunistic link transmission (OLT), the opportunistic path metrics, and the CR node metrics, the promising SAOR employs a cooperative scheme to enable multi-path transmissions and maintains the statistical QoS guaranteed throughput for practical applications.

An uninfected machine has a different behaviour: connections are made at a lower rate, and are locally correlated (repeat connections to recently accessed machines are likely).

{"abstract": "Abstract   Optimal task scheduling in a multiprocessor environment is known to be an NP-hard problem. The research efforts in this area have focused on heuristic methods for efficient distribution of tasks. This paper introduces two static task scheduling algorithms. The first algorithm, called Heavy Node First (HNF), is based on a local analysis of program graph nodes at each level. The second algorithm, called Weighted Length (WL), considers a more global view of the program graph and takes into account the relationship among the nodes at different levels. The two algorithms are compared to the classical Critical Path Method (CPM). For a given Directed Acyclic Graph of  n  nodes representing a program, it is shown that HNF requires  O ( n  log( n )) steps while WL and CPM require  O ( n  2 ) steps to accomplish the allocation. The nontrivial worst case performances of the three algorithms are analytically evaluated and their average case performances are evaluated through a simulation study. It is shown that the performance of the three algorithms, which is measured in terms of program execution time and processors' idle time, is almost the same. Therefore, taking into account the time complexity of the task distribution itself, we conclude that a simple and fast heuristic algorithm, such as HNF, may be sufficient to achieve adequate performance.", "authors": ["Behrooz Shirazi", "Mingfang Wang", "Girish Pathak"], "n_citation": 237, "references": ["037fca32-fbad-46cf-bc60-5b121eb5b6f4", "1d6beb5c-a799-44c1-b8ce-c95116431902", "34fe73b2-64e5-48b3-ab4c-31fe4cb4039c", "3ba7bcdf-fc1c-4907-b7e0-05407ac73eca", "6aec0cf3-52c8-4b68-bc14-0e0c89e7416f", "ad1a4975-5688-4aa2-b196-3be022d85e2e", "f589baa6-fab3-4f35-9ec4-a5f7c681096d"], "title": "Analysis and evaluation of heuristic methods for static task scheduling", "venue": "Journal of Parallel and Distributed Computing", "year": 1990, "id": "ddcd967f-b1df-4b59-8b6b-bc58b74036a0"}

{"abstract": "Cognitive radio (CR) technology enables the opportunistic use of the portions of the licensed spectrum by the CR users, while ensuring low interference to the primary user (PU) activity in the licensed bands. The spectrum is sensed locally by the CR users, and a specific channel that is acceptable to both the end nodes of the communication link is chosen. However, this necessitates a common control channel (CCC) for exchanging the sensing information and reserving the channel before actual data transfer. In this paper, a common control channel design for CR ad hoc networks is proposed, called as adaptive multiple rendezvous control channel (AMRCC) based on frequency hopping. Our scheme is scalable, and allows continuous connectivity between the CR users under dynamic PU activity. The contribution made in this paper is threefold: (i) a frequency hopping scheme is proposed that allows altering the hopping sequence based on the PU activity in the channels, (ii) a simple and low-overhead procedure is developed to aid new node-join and leave events, and (iii) a slot duration optimization is given that avoids a significant performance degradation with the number of available channels. Performance evaluation proves that our solution achieves better performance than the other classic CCC solutions in terms of time to rendezvous (TTR) and the resulting throughput, specifically in CR ad hoc networks.", "authors": ["C.

{"abstract": "We present a scalable and distributed control strategy for swarms of satellites to autonomously form an hexagonal lattice in space around a predefined meeting point. The control strategy is modeled as an artificial potential field. Such potential field is split in two main terms: a local potential is used to form locally hexagonal lattices based on the well known Lennard-Jones potential, and a global potential used to join the lattices into a single one. The control strategy uses only simple local information about few neighbouring satellites and assumes that each satellite can estimate its position with respect to the meeting point. Experiments show the results of the method with up to 500 satellites. The proposed method is general and can be adapted to build different kinds of lattices and shapes.", "authors": ["Carlo Pinciroli", "Mauro Birattari", "Elio Tuci", "Marco Dorigo", "M. del Rey Zapatero", "Tam\u00e1s Vink\u00f3", "Dario Izzo"], "n_citation": 33, "references": ["21df5b1a-a6c3-40e4-a51b-d79b2e4a1d6c", "675525e3-866a-4414-b4f6-4a77bfcc4054", "98f8676c-9357-4dd2-9cd8-e0afc88cfb24", "ee1c6d4b-944f-4051-920b-b4b8b77700d8"], "title": "Self-Organizing and Scalable Shape Formation for a Swarm of Pico Satellites", "venue": "adaptive hardware and systems", "year": 2008, "id": "dfb02785-9212-49ab-ba1a-049384ee129f"}
{"abstract": "Abstract   Learning can be viewed as mapping from an input space to an output space. Examples of these mappings are used to construct a continuous function that approximates the given data and generalizes for intermediate instances. Radial-basis function (RBF) networks are used to formulate this approximating function. A novel method is introduced that automatically constructs a generalized radial-basis function (GRBF) network for a given mapping and error bound. This network is shown to be the smallest network within the error bound for the given mapping. The integral wavelet transform is used to determine the parameters of the network. Simple one-dimensional examples are used to demonstrate how the network constructed using the transform is superior to that constructed using standard  ad hoc  optimization techniques.

Typically, scientists and practitioners tune metaheuristics by hand, guided only by their experience and by some rules of thumb.

The fundamental intuition that underlies Birattari's approach is that the tuning problem has much in common with the problems that are typically faced in machine learning.

First, by implementing an artificial whisker sensory system controlled using biologically plausible neural networks we hope to test existing models more thoroughly and develop new hypotheses for vibrissal sensory processing.

{"abstract": "The problem of distributed diagnosis in the presence of dynamic failures and repairs is considered. To address this problem, the notion of bounded correctness is defined. Bounded correctness is made up of three properties: bounded diagnostic latency, which ensures that information about state changes of nodes in the system reaches working nodes with a bounded delay, bounded start-up time, which guarantees that working nodes determine valid states for every other node in the system within bounded time after their recovery, and accuracy, which ensures that no spurious events are recorded by working nodes. It is shown that, in order to achieve bounded correctness, the rate at which nodes fail and are repaired must be limited. This requirement is quantified by defining a minimum state holding time in the system. Algorithm heartbeatcomplete is presented and it is proven that this algorithm achieves bounded correctness in fully-connected systems while simultaneously minimizing diagnostic latency, start-up time, and state holding time. A diagnosis algorithm for arbitrary topologies, known as algorithm forwardheartbeat, is also presented.

{"abstract": "Choreography analysis has been a crucial problem in service oriented computing. Interactions among services involve message exchanges across organizational boundaries in a distributed computing environment, and in order to build such systems in a reliable manner, it is necessary to develop techniques for analyzing such interactions. Choreography conformance involves verifying that a set of services behave according to a given choreography specification that characterizes their interactions. Unfortunately this is an undecidable problem when services interact with asynchronous communication. In this paper we present techniques that identify if the interaction behavior for a set of services remain the same when asynchronous communication is replaced with synchronous communication. This is called the synchronizability problem and determining the synchronizability of a set of services has been an open problem for several years. We solve this problem in this paper. Our results can be used to identify synchronizable services for which choreography conformance can be checked efficiently.

However, COTS middleware is generally too weak to handle intrusions (i.e., information attacks), thus making critical and commonly used information systems highly vulnerable. We evaluate the possible intrusion scenarios associated with today's commercial middleware platforms and discuss the possible impacts. We also describe our approach based on the concepts of fragmentation-redundancy-scattering (FRS) to provide intrusion tolerance to some of these intrusion threats and the utilities provided by the middleware to implement needed functionality.

{"abstract": "Partly motivated by entropy-estimation problems in neuroscience, we present a detailed and extensive comparison between some of the most popular and effective entropy estimation methods used in practice: The plug-in method, four different estimators based on the Lempel-Ziv (LZ) family of data compression algorithms, an estimator based on the Context-Tree Weighting (CTW) method, and the renewal entropy estimator. METHODOLOGY: Three new entropy estimators are introduced; two new LZ-based estimators, and the \"renewal entropy estimator,\" which is tailored to data generated by a binary renewal process. For two of the four LZ-based estimators, a bootstrap procedure is described for evaluating their standard error, and a practical rule of thumb is heuristically derived for selecting the values of their parameters in practice. THEORY: We prove that, unlike their earlier versions, the two new LZ-based estimators are universally consistent, that is, they converge to the entropy rate for every finite-valued, stationary and ergodic process. An effective method is derived for the accurate approximation of the entropy rate of a finite-state hidden Markov model (HMM) with known distribution. Heuristic calculations are presented and approximate formulas are derived for evaluating the bias and the standard error of each estimator. SIMULATION: All estimators are applied to a wide range of data generated by numerous different processes with varying degrees of dependence and memory. The main conclusions drawn from these experiments include: (i) For all estimators considered, the main source of error is the bias.

{"abstract": "The challenge for the World Wide Web user is to discover and rediscover useful information from very rich but also very diversified sources in the Web environment. The Web browser is a key interface to facilitate Web information access. In this paper, a framework is proposed to identify and investigate key factors that determine the Web browser's ability to assist users in performing various information-retrieval tasks. Design guidelines to help overcome the limitations associated with human information processing and the Web environment are introduced. Based on these guidelines, an on-line history tool (MEMOS) is developed to support user browsing, organization, and rediscovery tasks in both intra- and inter-sessional information retrieval. Empirical tests of user performance with the MEMOS tool are analysed in the context of our framework. We show that the MEMOS tool was perceived to be more useful than the history mechanisms used in popular Web browsers, but its benefit was most significant for inter-sessional support. Using sessions previously saved through the MEMOS tool to tackle specific retrieval questions was significantly faster and more accurate than trying to use standard rediscovery methods.", "authors": ["Milena M.

Next, the planes best fitting each of the regions constituting the partition of the image are determined. A third step locates potentially contiguous surfaces, while a final step reconstructs the hidden regions.

One way to achieve this is to use joint signed binary digit expansions of small \u201cweight.\u201d We study two algorithms, one based on nonadjacent forms of the coefficients of the linear combination, the other based on a certain joint sparse form specifically adapted to this problem. Both methods are sped up using the sliding windows approach combined with precomputed lookup tables. We give explicit and asymptotic results for the number of group operations needed, assuming uniform distribution of the coefficients. Expected values, variances and a central limit theorem are proved using generating functions.Furthermore, we provide a new algorithm that calculates the digits of an optimal expansion of pairs of integers from left to right. This avoids storing the whole expansion, which is needed with the previously known right-to-left methods, and allows an online computation.", "authors": ["Peter J.

{"abstract": "In their seminal paper, Frank and Jordan show that a large class of optimization problems including certain directed edge augmentation ones fall into the class of covering supermodular functions over pairs of sets. They also give an algorithm for such problems, however, that relies on the ellipsoid method.Our main result is a combinatorial algorithm for the restricted covering problem when the supermodular function is 0-1 valued; the problem includes directed vertex or S-T connectivity augmentation by one. Our algorithm uses an approach completely different from that of an independent recent result of Frank. It finds covers of partially ordered sets that satisfy natural abstract properties slightly extending those in Frank and Jordan. The algorithm resembles primal-dual augmenting path algorithms: For an initial (possibly greedy) cover the algorithm searches for witnesses for the necessity of each element in the cover. If no two witness have a common cover, the solution is optimal. As long as this is not the case, the witnesses are gradually exchanged by smaller ones (PUSHDOWN step). Each witness change defines an appropriate change in the solution; these changes are finally unwound in a shortest path manner to obtain a solution of size one less (REDUCE step).", "authors": ["Andr\u00e1s A.

{"abstract": "We argue that HCI has emerged as a design-oriented field of research, directed at large towards innovation, design, and construction of new kinds of information and interaction technology. But the understanding of such an attitude to research in terms of philosophical, theoretical, and methodological underpinnings seems however relatively poor within the field. This paper intends to specifically address what design 'is' and how it is related to HCI. First, three candidate accounts from design theory of what design 'is' are introduced; the conservative, the romantic, and the pragmatic. By examining the role of sketching in design, it is found that the designer becomes involved in a necessary dialogue, from which the design problem and its solution are worked out simultaneously as a closely coupled pair. In conclusion, it is proposed that we need to acknowledge, first, the role of design in HCI conduct, and second, the difference between the knowledge-generating Design-oriented Research and the artifact-generating conduct of Research-oriented Design.", "authors": ["Daniel Fallman"], "n_citation": 680, "references": ["1c6ac7d7-7e4e-44b1-8095-639d34f580bf", "41578728-9f16-46a4-b56e-95775ea237bf", "888f2b75-5f87-450f-a552-85d74ff4ad06", "d0de4b6f-9ddb-4e8a-82fe-234ccf40844c", "dd15066c-c556-4f40-bdb3-c6a3aa7e7db4"], "title": "Design-oriented human-computer interaction", "venue": "human factors in computing systems", "year": 2003, "id": "6737a0e8-bef5-4a22-b083-6c87bc299e12"}

{"abstract": "Linear discriminant analysis (LDA) is a popular feature extraction technique for face recognition. However, It often suffers from the small sample size problem when dealing with the high dimensional face data. Fisherface and null space LDA (N-LDA) are two conventional approaches to address this problem. But in many cases, these LDA classifiers are overfitted to the training set and discard some useful discriminative information. In this paper, by analyzing different overfitting problems for the two kinds of LDA classifiers, we propose an approach using random subspace and bagging to improve them respectively. By random sampling on feature vector and training samples, multiple stabilized Fisherface and N-LDA classifiers are constructed. The two kinds of complementary classifiers are integrated using a fusion rule, so nearly all the discriminative information is preserved. We also apply this approach to the integration of multiple features.

{"abstract": "The development of requirements specifications inevitably involves modification and evolution. To support modification while preserving particular requirements goals and properties, the use of a cycle composed of two phases: analysis and revision is proposed. In the analysis phase, a desirable property of the system is checked against a partial specification. Should the property be violated, diagnostic information is provided. In the revision phase, the diagnostic information is used to help modify the specification in such a way that the new specification no longer violates the original property. An instance of the above analysis-revision cycle that combines new techniques of logical abduction and inductive learning to analyse and revise specifications, respectively is investigated. More specifically, given an (event-based) system description and a system property, abductive reasoning is applied in refutation mode to verify whether the description satisfies the property and, if it does not, identify diagnostic information in the form of a set of examples of property violation. These (counter) examples are then used to generate a corresponding set of examples of system behaviours that should be covered by the system description. Finally, such examples are used as training examples for inductive learning, changing the system description in order to resolve the property violation. This is accomplished with the use of the connectionist inductive learning and logic programming system-a hybrid system based on neural networks and the backpropagation learning algorithm. A case study of an automobile cruise control system illustrates the approach and provides some early validation of its capabilities.", "authors": ["A.S. d'Avila Garcez", "A.

{"abstract": "In cognitive radio (CR) systems, secondary users (SUs) have to detect the channel periodically during their data transmission to decide whether the channel is idle in order to avoid unacceptable interferences to primary users (PUs). The duration of the detection process in a cycle affects the channel efficiency of the SU. Also, the detection time needs to be adaptively adjusted due to path loss variations caused by movements of PUs and SUs. In this paper, we explore the issue on the detection time selection that aims at improving the channel efficiency. We formulate this issue as an optimization problem, but it is extremely difficult to get the explicit solution. A numerical optimization algorithm is proposed to obtain the numerical solution to the problem. Numerical results show that the highest channel efficiency can be achieved by the optimization of the detection time.", "authors": ["Peng Wang", "Limin Xiao", "Shidong Zhou", "Jing Wang"], "n_citation": 143, "references": ["ae181a84-6fa8-40d4-bd5c-6edd37ff114b", "d1ba534e-3f80-4366-bb83-be16006f9e18"], "title": "Optimization of Detection Time for Channel Efficiency in Cognitive Radio Systems", "venue": "wireless communications and networking conference", "year": 2007, "id": "dd6c310d-3a44-41ee-ba35-770128725a7b"}

Consequently the development of intelligent debugging tools that aid the programmer in this task is a topic of major industrial interest. This work describes two representations for applying model-based diagnosis to Java programs, a technique that permits locating (and partly correcting) faults without requiring a formal specification of the desired program behavior, since interaction can be limited to test cases and observations of variable correctness. One of the models uses a special transformation to provide more accurate diagnoses on programs with loops and this is borne out by the experiments. The presented results on actual debugging performance show clearly superior accuracy to classical debugging techniques, and better discrimination than dependency-based programs models.

{"abstract": "A new framework for reducing impulse noise from digital color images is presented, in which a fuzzy detection phase is followed by an iterative fuzzy filtering technique. We call this filter the fuzzy two-step color filter. The fuzzy detection method is mainly based on the calculation of fuzzy gradient values and on fuzzy reasoning. This phase determines three separate membership functions that are passed to the filtering step. These membership functions will be used as a representation of the fuzzy set impulse noise (one function for each color component). Our proposed new fuzzy method is especially developed for reducing impulse noise from color images while preserving details and texture. Experiments show that the proposed filter can be used for efficient removal of impulse noise from color images without distorting the useful information in the image", "authors": ["Stefan Schulte", "V.

{"abstract": "Breast cancer continues to be a significant public health problem in the United States. Approximately, 182,000 new cases of breast cancer are diagnosed and 46,000 women die of breast cancer each year. Even more disturbing is the fact that one out of eight women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point during her lifetime. Since the cause of breast cancer remains unknown, primary prevention becomes impossible. Computer-aided mammography is an important and challenging task in automated diagnosis. It has great potential over traditional interpretation of film-screen mammography in terms of efficiency and accuracy. Microcalcifications are the earliest sign of breast carcinomas and their detection is one of the key issues for breast cancer control. In this study, a novel approach to microcalcification detection based on fuzzy logic technique is presented. Microcalcifications are first enhanced based on their brightness and nonuniformity. Then, the irrelevant breast structures are excluded by a curve detector. Finally, microcalcifications are located using an iterative threshold selection method. The shapes of microcalcifications are reconstructed and the isolated pixels are removed by employing the mathematical morphology technique. The essential idea of the proposed approach is to apply a fuzzified image of a mammogram to locate the suspicious regions and to interact the fuzzified image with the original image to preserve fidelity. The major advantage of the proposed method is its ability to detect microcalcifications even in very dense breast mammograms. A series of clinical mammograms are employed to test the proposed algorithm and the performance is evaluated by the free-response receiver operating characteristic curve. The experiments aptly show that the microcalcifications can be accurately detected even in very dense mammograms using the proposed approach.", "authors": ["Heng-Da Cheng", "Yui Man Lui", "Rita I.

{"abstract": "As an increasingly large number of OWL ontologies become available on the Semantic Web and the descriptions in the ontologies become more complicated, finding the cause of errors becomes an extremely hard task even for experts. Existing ontology development environments provide some limited support, in conjunction with a reasoner, for reporting errors in OWL ontologies. Typically, these are restricted to the mere detection of, for example, unsatisfiable concepts. However, the diagnosis and resolution of the bug is not supported at all. For example, no explanation is given as to why the error occurs (e.g., by pinpointing the root clash, or axioms in the ontology responsible for the clash) or how dependencies between classes cause the error to propagate (i.e., by distinguishing root from derived unsatisfiable classes). In the former case, information from the internals of a description logic tableaux reasoner can be extracted and presented to the user (glass box approach); while in the latter case, the reasoner can be used as an oracle for a certain set of questions and the asserted structure of the ontology can be used to help isolate the source of the problems (black box approach). Based on the two approaches, we have integrated a number of debugging cues generated from our reasoner, Pellet, in our hypertextual ontology development environment, Swoop. A conducted usability evaluation demonstrates that these debugging cues significantly improve the OWL debugging experience, and point the way to more general improvements in the presentation of an ontology to users.", "authors": ["Aditya Kalyanpur", "Bijan Parsia", "Evren Sirin", "James A.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we develop a rigorous, unified framework based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) to study epidemic routing and its variations. These ODEs can be derived as limits of Markovian models under a natural scaling as the number of nodes increases. While an analytical study of Markovian models is quite complex and numerical solution impractical for large networks, the corresponding ODE models yield closed-form expressions for several performance metrics of interest, and a numerical solution complexity that does not increase with the number of nodes. Using this ODE approach, we investigate how resources such as buffer space and the number of copies made for a packet can be traded for faster delivery, illustrating the differences among various forwarding and recovery schemes considered. We perform model validations through simulation studies. Finally we consider the effect of buffer management by complementing the forwarding models with Markovian and fluid buffer models.", "authors": ["Xiaolan Zhang", "Giovanni Neglia", "James F.

{"abstract": "The object-process methodology incorporates the system static-structural and dynamic-procedural aspects into a single, unified model. This unification bridges the gap that separates the static, \u201cobject\u201d model from the dynamic, behavior, state, or function-oriented models found in many current object oriented methodologies. In this work we concentrate on the transition from object-process analysis to design within the development of information systems. We use a detailed case study as a running example throughout the paper to demonstrate how the structure-behavior unification, which characterizes object-process analysis, is carried on to object-process design. The case study first applies object-process analysis to perform the analysis stage. The sequence of steps that constitutes the design is then discussed and demonstrated through the case study. The design is divided into two phases: the analysis refinement phase and the implementation-dependent phase. Analysis refinement is concerned with adding details to the analysis results which are beyond the interest of the analysis itself, yet they are not related with a particular implementation. The implementation-dependent phase is concerned with code-level design, which takes place after specific implementation details, such as programming language, data organization, and user interface, have been made during the strategic design.", "authors": ["Dov Dori", "Moshe Goodman"], "n_citation": 23, "references": ["0c5c8cf3-8767-47e6-bbdb-5dd85b0c0ef0", "24a59f34-fac7-461d-b5cd-10862aa262f2", "addda101-846d-4207-b4ba-84830c1475c1"], "title": "From object-process analysis to object-process design", "venue": "Annals of Software Engineering", "year": 1996, "id": "1d8843a8-6539-4494-9583-7ea1ac30b931"}
{"abstract": "Reuse of existing code from class libraries and frameworks is often difficult because APIs are complex and the client code required to use the APIs can be hard to write. We observed that a common scenario is that the programmer knows what type of object he needs, but does not know how to write the code to get the object.In order to help programmers write API client code more easily, we developed techniques for synthesizing  jungloid  code fragments automatically given a simple query that describes that desired code in terms of input and output types. A jungloid is simply a unary expression; jungloids are simple, enabling synthesis, but are also versatile, covering many coding problems, and composable, combining to form more complex code fragments. We synthesize jungloids using both API method signatures and jungloids  mined  from a corpus of sample client programs.We implemented a tool,  prospector , based on these techniques.  prospector  is integrated with the Eclipse IDE code assistance feature, and it infers queries from context so there is no need for the programmer to write queries. We tested  prospector  on a set of real programming problems involving APIs;  prospector  found the desired solution for 18 of 20 problems. We also evaluated  prospector  in a user study, finding that programmers solved programming problems more quickly and with more reuse when using  prospector  than without  prospector .", "authors": ["David Mandelin", "Lin Xu", "Rastislav Bodik", "Doug Kimelman"], "n_citation": 418, "references": ["1735f072-f54a-4cc2-b4ec-bebd4e204e63", "2c08d317-3848-40af-9dfa-20c8ce584ce9", "41d61ab8-efb3-4b3f-a678-016f31194368", "4fae7aa2-96a8-48e7-9a1e-5a6a379c8de9", "54fe2662-f4fe-4b27-903b-c9c84b1dc732", "79193c42-bfb2-48c1-8725-754e2bb683ff", "81a34810-632e-45dd-be5f-52f0519c9cb2", "9d2dabb3-0421-40fd-9001-37357f4297cf", "9f31d442-de4c-47b8-9a9d-0375c18f2597", "a37bac2e-5ffb-4607-b163-c26d23d30af6", "b327b607-c45b-41ef-9cd0-535f0d1db54b", "ea89ced8-e205-4c33-9855-6fe150bdc158", "f32c18f2-e064-4ab8-902e-a006bb315146", "f5205d93-30a6-461a-b915-aeaa3e37ac82"], "title": "Jungloid mining: helping to navigate the API jungle", "venue": "programming language design and implementation", "year": 2005, "id": "c2bd41a8-c67a-4cd6-a893-035fd03278ed"}

Channels allow anonymous, and point-to-point communication among components, while mobility allows dynamic reconfiguration of channel connections in a system. This model supports dynamic distributed systems where components can be mobile. It provides an efficient way of interaction among components. Furthermore, our model provides a clear separation between the computational part and the coordination part of a system, allowing the development and description of the coordination structure of a system to be done in a transparent and exogenous way. Our description of the Java implementation of this coordination model demonstrates that it is self-contained enough for developing component-based systems in object-oriented languages. However, if desired, our model can be used as a basis to extend other models that focus on other aspects of components that are less concerned with composition and coordination issues.", "authors": ["Juan Guillen-Scholten", "Farhad Arbab", "Frank S. de Boer", "Marcello M.

In this paper, we study the problem of finding a set of low cost paths for anycast routing with bandwidth constraint. The anycast routing problem (ARP) in this case involves the construction of a set of low-cost paths with bandwidth requirements, one for each source, for anycasting messages to one of the member in the anycast destination group. An optimal solution to ARP is a set of paths, one for each source node, that incurs the least overall cost. This problem is known to be NP-complete and hence a heuristic algorithm is proposed to find solutions for the problem. In addition, we derive a lower bound on the cost of an optimal solution for ARP by using Lagrangean Relaxation and Subgradient Optimization techniques. This lower bound is used to evaluate the performance of anycast routing algorithms in terms of their ability to find close-to-optimal solution.

The new contributions include: (i) we develop the polyhedral foundation of the PCL framework, based on the structural and algorithmic properties of a new polytope associated with an accessible set system\\(\\)\\(\\)-extended polymatroid}); (ii) we present new dynamic allocation indices for RBs, motivated by an admission control model, which extend Whittle's and have a significantly increased scope; (iii) we deploy PCLs to obtain both sufficient conditions for the existence of the new indices (PCL-indexability), and a new adaptive-greedy index algorithm; (iv) we interpret PCL-indexability as a form of the classic economics law of diminishing marginal returns, and characterize the index as an optimal marginal cost rate; we further solve a related optimal constrained control problem; (v) we carry out a PCL-indexability analysis of the motivating admission control model, under time-discounted and long-run average criteria; this gives, under mild conditions, a new index characterization of optimal threshold policies; and (vi) we apply the latter to present new heuristic index policies for two hard queueing control problems: admission control and routing to parallel queues; and scheduling a multiclass make-to-stock queue with lost sales, both under state-dependent holding cost rates and birth-death dynamics.", "authors": ["Jos\u00e9 Ni\u00f1o-Mora"], "n_citation": 71, "references": ["090a55a8-73b0-4f07-9467-fadeac63cc44", "2142a5ab-c5fd-4d90-b45a-0642edac5d6d", "3659f2d5-bc81-467e-9488-34aff690bdc3", "386a72fa-e780-4fc1-8c69-b0695b97e396", "46145c99-1317-4114-adaf-9c2cd61b1890", "4e1dc6e4-9b09-41f1-aaf9-86a71f8c32a4", "59651733-4777-44f1-a299-e207cac5f83e", "788ff4de-d077-4423-a957-caa1c7bfdd0c", "82059393-d64c-42b2-92d2-3ee8e16790bb", "8dfd7bbc-5a49-4217-816e-7661c10d9350", "bde20f29-30c1-410f-9e2d-6c29c980bd8d", "db44dd37-b434-47a1-9049-ef317dd1d0c8", "f3c86dae-e444-4196-8b1d-95d84ce4ff18"], "title": "Dynamic allocation indices for restless projects and queueing admission control: a polyhedral approach", "venue": "Mathematical Programming", "year": 2002, "id": "1d30cbbc-aa94-4402-9c0e-2170e2a82346"}

{"abstract": "Predictive control in buildings has undergone an intensive research in the past years. Model identification plays a central role in a predictive control approach. This paper presents a comprehensive study of modeling of a large multi-zone office building. Many of the common methods used for modeling of the buildings, such as a detailed modeling of the physical properties, RC modeling, etc., appeared to be unfeasible because of the complexity of the problem. Moreover, most of the research papers dealing with this topic presents identification (and control) of either a single-zone building, or a single building sub-system. On contrary, we proposed a novel approach combining a detailed modeling by a building-design software with a black-box subspace identification.

{"abstract": "The authors advocate a systolic neural network architecture for implementing the hidden Markov models (HMMs). A programmable systolic array is proposed which maximizes the power of VLSI implementations in terms of intensive and pipelined computing and yet circumvents the limitation on communication. A unified algorithmic formulation for recurrent back-propagation (RBP) networks and HMMs is exploited for the architectural design. It results in a basic structure for these connectionist networks that operates like a universal simulation tool, accomplishing the information storage/retrieval process by altering the pattern of connections among a large number of primitive units and/or by modifying certain weights associated with each connection. Important concerns regarding partitioning for large networks, fault tolerance for ring array architectures, scaling to avoid underflow, and architecture for locally interconnected networks are discussed. Implementations based on commercially available VLSI chips (e.g. Inmos T800) and custom VLSI technology are discussed. >", "authors": ["Jenq-Neng Hwang", "John A.

{"abstract": "Visual notations like class diagrams, and use case diagrams are very popular with practitioners for capturing requirements of software applications. These notations unfortunately have little or no semantics, and hence cannot be analyzed by tools. Formal notations, on the other hand, have associated tools that check specifications for stated properties but are difficult to integrate with software development processes in use. Strengths of both approaches can be exploited by giving formal semantics to popular notations. Here we propose a novel usage of UML object diagrams for specifying pre- and post-conditions for use cases and capturing global system properties as class invariants. A translation is defined from object diagrams to the formal notation TLA/sup +/. The TLA/sup +/ specification is then formally verified using the model checker TLC. The proposed notation is intuitive, expressive and formal. We present a small case study to illustrate its strengths.", "authors": ["Ulka Shrotri", "Purandar Bhaduri", "R.

{"abstract": "Although successive generations of middleware (such as RPC, CORBA, and DCOM) have made it easier to connect distributed programs, the process of distributed application decomposition has changed little: programmers manually divide applications into sub-programs and manually assign those sub-programs to machines. Often the techniques used to choose a distribution are ad hoc and create one-time solutions biased to a specific combination of users, machines, and networks. We assert that system software, not the programmer, should manage the task of distributed decomposition. To validate our assertion we present Coign, an automatic distributed partitioning system that significantly eases the development of distributed applications. Given an application (in binary form) built from distributable COM components, Coign constructs a graph model of the application's inter-component communication through scenario-based profiling. Later, Coign applies a graph-cutting algorithm to partition the application across a network and minimize execution delay due to network communication. Using Coign, even an end user (without access to source code) can transform a non-distributed application into an optimized, distributed application. Coign has automatically distributed binaries from over 2 million lines of application code, including Microsoft '5 PhotoDraw 2000 image processor. To our knowledge, Coign is the first system to automatically partition and distribute binary applications.", "authors": ["Galen C. Hunt", "Michael L.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we address the problem of adaptive neural control for a class of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear time-delay systems in block-triangular form. Based on a neural network (NN) online approximation model, a novel adaptive neural controller is obtained by constructing a novel quadratic-type Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, which not only efficiently avoids the controller singularity, but also relaxes the restriction on unknown virtual control coefficients. The merit of the suggested controller design scheme is that the number of online adapted parameters is independent of the number of nodes of the neural networks, which reduces the number of the online adaptive learning laws considerably. The proposed controller guarantees that all closed-loop signals remain bounded, while the output tracking error dynamics converges to a neighborhood of the origin.

{"abstract": "Blood pool agents (BPAs) for contrast-enhanced (CE) magnetic-resonance angiography (MRA) allow prolonged imaging times for higher contrast and resolution. Imaging is performed during the steady state when the contrast agent is distributed through the complete vascular system. However, simultaneous venous and arterial enhancement in this steady state hampers interpretation. In order to improve visualization of the arteries and veins from steady-state BPA data, a semiautomated method for artery-vein separation is presented. In this method, the central arterial axis and central venous axis are used as initializations for two surfaces that simultaneously evolve in order to capture the arterial and venous parts of the vasculature using the level-set framework. Since arteries and veins can be in close proximity of each other, leakage from the evolving arterial (venous) surface into the venous (arterial) part of the vasculature is inevitable. In these situations, voxels are labeled arterial or venous based on the arrival time of the respective surface. The evolution is steered by external forces related to feature images derived from the image data and by internal forces related to the geometry of the level sets. In this paper, the robustness and accuracy of three external forces (based on image intensity, image gradient, and vessel-enhancement filtering) and combinations of them are investigated and tested on seven patient datasets. To this end, results with the level-set-based segmentation are compared to the reference-standard manually obtained segmentations. Best results are achieved by applying a combination of intensity- and gradient-based forces and a smoothness constraint based on the curvature of the surface. By applying this combination to the seven datasets, it is shown that, with minimal user interaction, artery-vein separation for improved arterial and venous visualization in BPA CE-MRA can be achieved.", "authors": ["C.M. van Bemmel", "L.J.

{"abstract": "We present an approach to stochastic performance guarantees for multimedia servers with mixed workloads. Advanced multimedia applications such as digital libraries or teleteaching exhibit a mixed workload with accesses to both \"continuous\" and conventional, \"discrete\" data, where the fractions of continuous data and discrete data requests vary over time. We assume that a server shares all disks among continuous and discrete data, and we develop a stochastic performance model for the resulting mixed workload, using a combination of analytic and simulation based modeling. Based on this model we devise a round based scheduling scheme with stochastic performance guarantees: for continous data requests, we bound the probability that \"glitches\" occur and for discrete data requests, we bound the probability that the response time exceeds a certain tolerance threshold.

{"abstract": "Portability, efficiency, and ease of coding are all important considerations in choosing the programming model for a scalable parallel application. The message-passing programming model is widely used because of its portability, yet some applications are too complex to code in it while also trying to maintain a balanced computation load and avoid redundant computations. The shared-memory programming model simplifies coding, but it is not portable and often provides little control over interprocessor data transfer costs. This paper describes an approach, called Global Arrays (GAs), that combines the better features of both other models, leading to both simple coding and efficient execution. The key concept of GAs is that they provide a portable interface through which each process in a MIMD parallel program can asynchronously access logical blocks of physically distributed matrices, with no need for explicit cooperation by other processes. We have implemented the GA library on a variety of computer systems, including the Intel Delta and Paragon, the IBM SP-1 and SP-2 (all message passers), the Kendall Square Research KSR-1/2 and the Convex SPP-1200 (nonuniform access shared-memory machines), the CRAY T3D (a globally addressable distributed-memory computer), and networks of UNIX workstations. We discuss the design and implementation of these libraries, report their performance, illustrate the use of GAs in the context of computational chemistry applications, and describe the use of a GA performance visualization tool.", "authors": ["Jaroslaw Nieplocha", "Robert J.

{"abstract": "Growing core counts have highlighted the need for scalable on-chip coherence mechanisms. The increase in the number of on-chip cores exposes the energy and area costs of scaling the directories. Duplicate-tag-based directories require highly associative structures that grow with core count, precluding scalability due to prohibitive power consumption. Sparse directories overcome the power barrier by reducing directory associativity, but require storage area over-provisioning to avoid high invalidation rates. We propose the Cuckoo directory, a power- and area-efficient scalable distributed directory. The cuckoo directory scales to high core counts without the energy costs of wide associative lookup and without gross capacity over-provisioning. Simulation of a 16-core CMP with commercial server and scientific workloads shows that the Cuckoo directory eliminates invalidations while being up to four times more power-efficient than the Duplicate-tag directory and 24% more power-efficient and up to seven times more area-efficient than the Sparse directory organization. Analytical projections indicate that the Cuckoo directory retains its energy and area benefits with increasing core count, efficiently scaling to at least 1024 cores.", "authors": ["Michael Ferdman", "Pejman Lotfi-Kamran", "Ken Balet", "Babak Falsafi"], "n_citation": 123, "references": ["0441368e-f22d-452a-829a-39173fa5b551", "06911d2e-fbee-483c-bab7-499b139f38ec", "111f2584-8c19-4c7e-a2b1-d8d251d5ec83", "1212edb0-8d3e-4707-bd6c-63cda81f8462", "132c3aed-65b0-436f-94a2-4350b6fbf25c", "13c525c6-10f3-4221-852a-9ad443f1ece8", "23f09a1d-af97-4795-9a77-422517837dd6", "29018156-be5e-4815-b5e2-bd2fb3c212de", "2c7cfad7-1dba-48f8-aad5-e78c3ef7700e", "3ed7c3d2-992c-40ad-a7b6-df6e43a7d390", "40c2bc98-87c3-4094-9334-41a0aff28030", "4d041f28-28e2-40c0-852d-c9a871c76ea6", "5c2f22c8-0afb-41b5-9bcf-797ab1885f2e", "648aadc8-ccc7-4c86-93e4-20400ce1b570", "9235dd52-331c-483b-b805-b3bb7d1a5448", "950e8595-5c28-41df-b999-42fd5caf9962", "95427c6f-19c1-441a-96fd-01d35ef38b58", "970c4fb9-2b30-421b-ba39-e1ba6357f78d", "a00aca5b-b2ef-46f8-ae2e-f37399496269", "a93a15cd-341c-485f-a6ba-1a4fd350c5e8", "b0c9cc86-3d18-44b9-855f-b94da5f24227", "b90800de-9b0c-492b-b4c0-09237b550cee", "b9b3f626-0528-46ce-b60e-71ed6c6f6491", "bdc23497-23e9-44d4-84d3-359ec1b8af5d", "c02c5402-8bef-4c06-aab8-76df89b6f33d", "d8707138-9599-4326-919d-769c7368d7de", "e305bd68-b31d-4090-96fb-c45b58411ac4", "e978dfcc-7b70-40db-9429-531ffe189fe3", "ead3ff4f-f6d8-46bb-90f6-8a1c17d00c11", "f719810d-5203-421d-aba8-7e3c7eb78add", "f94b9ac5-69fc-483a-905f-aea11dad4967", "fd0fbb90-f269-4633-97fc-8b7195324c36"], "title": "Cuckoo directory: A scalable directory for many-core systems", "venue": "high-performance computer architecture", "year": 2011, "id": "965e5071-563f-42be-a7a2-b418f548ed83"}

The analysis is based on an instance distribution which is parameterized to simulate a variety of sample characteristics. The algorithm assigns values to variables appearing in a given instance of 3-Satisfiability, one at a time, using the unit clause heuristic and a maximum occurring literal selection heuristic; at each step a variable is chosen randomly from a subset of variables which is usually large. The algorithm runs in polynomial time and it is shown that the algorithm finds a solution to a random instance of 3-Satisfiability with probability bounded from below by a constant greater than zero for a range of parameter values. The heuristics studied here can be used to select variables in a Backtrack algorithm for 3-Satisfiability.

{"abstract": "Technology in the field of digital media generates huge amounts of nontextual information, audio, video, and images, along with more familiar textual information. The potential for exchange and retrieval of information is vast and daunting. The key problem in achieving efficient and user-friendly retrieval is the development of a search mechanism to guarantee delivery of minimal irrelevant information (high precision) while insuring relevant information is not overlooked (high recall). The traditional solution employs keyword-based search. The only documents retrieved are those containing user-specified keywords. But many documents convey desired semantic information without containing these keywords. This limitation is frequently addressed through query expansion mechanisms based on the statistical co-occurrence of terms. Recall is increased, but at the expense of deteriorating precision. One can overcome this problem by indexing documents according to context and meaning rather than keywords, although this requires a method of converting words to meanings and the creation of a meaning-based index structure. We have solved the problem of an index structure through the design and implementation of a concept-based model using domain-dependent ontologies. An ontology is a collection of concepts and their interrelationships that provide an abstract view of an application domain. With regard to converting words to meaning, the key issue is to identify appropriate concepts that both describe and identify documents as well as language employed in user requests. This paper describes an automatic mechanism for selecting these concepts. An important novelty is a scalable disambiguation algorithm that prunes irrelevant concepts and allows relevant ones to associate with documents and participate in query generation. We also propose an automatic query expansion mechanism that deals with user requests expressed in natural language. This mechanism generates database queries with appropriate and relevant expansion through knowledge encoded in ontology form. Focusing on audio data, we have constructed a demonstration prototype.

{"abstract": "Characters in real-time computer games need to move smoothly and thus need to search in real time. In this paper, we describe a simple but powerful way of speeding up repeated A* searches with the same goal states, namely by updating the heuristics between A* searches. We then use this technique to develop a novel real-time heuristic search method, called Real-Time Adaptive A*, which is able to choose its local search spaces in a fine-grained way. It updates the values of all states in its local search spaces and can do so very quickly. Our experimental results for characters in real-time computer games that need to move to given goal coordinates in unknown terrain demonstrate that this property allows Real-Time Adaptive A* to follow trajectories of smaller cost for given time limits per search episode than a recently proposed real-time heuristic search method [5] that is more difficult to implement.", "authors": ["Sven Koenig", "Maxim Likhachev"], "n_citation": 135, "references": ["0ba2f7ea-c877-4a16-ba16-f800dca58346", "589005ca-7aa0-4427-aeb5-32ce0fb77111", "5ad5a989-d840-4343-ab09-094956a1dbaa", "5e18f553-1735-4333-8881-b151fd5cf48e", "6f9239e0-9427-4c07-9bc8-c978aa879307", "83359201-f6d5-4572-97df-c06380267aa1", "a5342bea-6da4-4b1a-9836-fd5fb03c2e50", "cc472bf2-070a-497f-937e-fc0fd2c66e21", "d9ba81a3-9e71-45da-8a01-1767467536ac", "dc9502ce-4e88-4193-8b77-57c6eae6bdca", "defe30a5-6ba2-4b2c-b26c-d64d51f343d8"], "title": "Real-time adaptive A*", "venue": "adaptive agents and multi-agents systems", "year": 2006, "id": "9840d1e0-8ae1-4713-85f9-aa406a7f2a74"}

In case the adversary knows the patrol scheme of the robots and the robots use a deterministic patrol algorithm, then in many cases it is possible to penetrate with probability 1. Therefore this paper considers a non-deterministic patrol scheme for the robots, such that their movement is characterized by a probability p. This patrol scheme allows reducing the probability of penetration, even under an assumption of a strong opponent that knows the patrol scheme. We offer an optimal polynomial-time algorithm for finding the probability p such that the minimal probability of penetration detection throughout the perimeter is maximized.

{"abstract": "A joint estimator is presented for the two parameters that define the long-range dependence phenomenon in the simplest case. The estimator is based on the coefficients of a discrete wavelet decomposition, improving a wavelet-based estimator of the scaling parameter (Abry and Veitch 1998), as well as extending it to include the associated power parameter. An important feature is its conceptual and practical simplicity, consisting essentially in measuring the slope and the intercept of a linear fit after a discrete wavelet transform is performed, a very fast (O(n)) operation. Under well-justified technical idealizations the estimator is shown to be unbiased and of minimum or close to minimum variance for the scale parameter, and asymptotically unbiased and efficient for the second parameter. Through theoretical arguments and numerical simulations it is shown that in practice, even for small data sets, the bias is very small and the variance close to optimal for both parameters. Closed-form expressions are given for the covariance matrix of the estimator as a function of data length, and are shown by simulation to be very accurate even when the technical idealizations are not satisfied. Comparisons are made against two maximum-likelihood estimators. In terms of robustness and computational cost the wavelet estimator is found to be clearly superior and statistically its performance is comparable.

{"abstract": "A novel multiscale topomorphologic approach for opening of two isointensity objects fused at different locations and scales is presented and applied to separating arterial and venous trees in 3-D pulmonary multidetector X-ray computed tomography (CT) images. Initialized with seeds, the two isointensity objects (arteries and veins) grow iteratively while maintaining their spatial exclusiveness and eventually form two mutually disjoint objects at convergence. The method is intended to solve the following two fundamental challenges: how to find local size of morphological operators and how to trace continuity of locally separated regions. These challenges are met by combining fuzzy distance transform (FDT), a morphologic feature with a topologic fuzzy connectivity, and a new morphological reconstruction step to iteratively open finer and finer details starting at large scales and progressing toward smaller scales. The method employs efficient user intervention at locations where local morphological separability assumption does not hold due to imaging ambiguities or any other reason. The approach has been validated on mathematically generated tubular objects and applied to clinical pulmonary noncontrast CT data for separating arteries and veins. The tradeoff between accuracy and the required user intervention for the method has been quantitatively examined by comparing with manual outlining. The experimental study, based on a blind seed selection strategy, has demonstrated that above 95% accuracy may be achieved using 25-40 seeds for each of arteries and veins. Our method is very promising for semiautomated separation of arteries and veins in pulmonary CT images even when there is no object-specific intensity variation at conjoining locations.", "authors": ["Punam K.

{"abstract": "In this article, we present a novel linear time algorithm for  data remapping , that is, (i) lightweight; (ii) fully automated; and (iii) applicable in the context of pointer-centric programming languages with dynamic memory allocation support. All previous work in this area lacks one or more of these features. We proceed to demonstrate a  novel application of this algorithm as a key step in optimizing the design of an embedded memory system.  Specifically, we show that by virtue of locality enhancements via data remapping, we may reduce the memory subsystem needs of an application by 50p, and hence concomitantly reduce the associated costs in terms of size, power, and dollar-investment (61p). Such a reduction overcomes key hurdles in designing high-performance embedded computing solutions. Namely, memory subsystems are very desirable from a performance standpoint, but their costs have often limited their use in embedded systems. Thus, our innovative approach offers the intriguing possibility of compilers playing a significant role in exploring and optimizing the design space of a memory subsystem for an embedded design. To this end and in order to properly leverage the improvements afforded by a compiler optimization,  we identify a range of measures for quantifying the cost-impact of popular notions of locality, prefetching, regularity of memory access, and others . The proposed methodology will become increasingly important, especially as the needs for application specific embedded architectures become prevalent. In addition, we demonstrate the wide applicability of data remapping using several existing microprocessors, such as the Pentium and UltraSparc. Namely, we show that remapping can achieve a performance improvement of 20p on the average.

{"abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images by support vector machines (SVMs). First, we propose a theoretical discussion and experimental analysis aimed at understanding and assessing the potentialities of SVM classifiers in hyperdimensional feature spaces. Then, we assess the effectiveness of SVMs with respect to conventional feature-reduction-based approaches and their performances in hypersubspaces of various dimensionalities. To sustain such an analysis, the performances of SVMs are compared with those of two other nonparametric classifiers (i.e., radial basis function neural networks and the K-nearest neighbor classifier). Finally, we study the potentially critical issue of applying binary SVMs to multiclass problems in hyperspectral data. In particular, four different multiclass strategies are analyzed and compared: the one-against-all, the one-against-one, and two hierarchical tree-based strategies. Different performance indicators have been used to support our experimental studies in a detailed and accurate way, i.e., the classification accuracy, the computational time, the stability to parameter setting, and the complexity of the multiclass architecture. The results obtained on a real Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectroradiometer hyperspectral dataset allow to conclude that, whatever the multiclass strategy adopted, SVMs are a valid and effective alternative to conventional pattern recognition approaches (feature-reduction procedures combined with a classification method) for the classification of hyperspectral remote sensing data.", "authors": ["Farid Melgani", "Lorenzo Bruzzone"], "n_citation": 1811, "references": ["07e9c996-f68a-423e-8226-d90d12c010ff", "0da779f9-3d14-4984-9ee1-d7c0eb662676", "195afc8b-df2b-4c12-b0ad-21ea8dc8b3f8", "2e1330b1-2654-461b-bae9-2119bb920625", "48fea7ce-03e7-4665-b01d-76da39eeb80e", "532dec4c-28bf-4ca8-aa3b-fc5b5b20bb2d", "533d9db7-7827-4845-bfd3-abb1e74c7739", "5abcf5a1-3b19-436a-bdf6-e9c0fbdffb8e", "63a90a64-9287-49a3-a32b-e64f5ca24734", "73784c55-febd-4688-a3a6-74f1518ce37b", "78cb0b00-98aa-4f6d-bd0b-288ff0e4c0db", "7e60e052-c4ed-43e6-856f-2d28110678bb", "898fc99a-3cc7-4c25-9b6f-9a7da43aabc1", "8c569827-07e0-41bd-ae2f-ce78eced67ab", "8f7e4317-a556-4f1c-894c-a9a378a32074", "91979159-37d8-410f-a245-a33ef80a092b", "9384fdc2-ca2a-4706-b0cc-23efbc7d9e6e", "94fe7335-3907-40c9-b4a0-026b8c2db8fb", "98a58da2-f69d-49ff-94f4-54ecd56e0b11", "b70940ae-b503-4d02-88da-54393fd475e1", "c934e1cf-01b6-47ff-8bb4-366c33530aa0", "d04682be-3715-4727-b177-709d7eab30d7", "d90d9345-ccc0-45c4-8c5b-4ef3d7aaf011", "dd6d8598-e1df-41e2-8676-0036e210292c", "f006e236-59ad-4647-a59f-4f46dc2c85be", "f4893b28-df8a-4595-a765-2ac0629f2d98", "feff8862-f47d-4591-a7cb-b62d7efc81a2"], "title": "Classification of hyperspectral remote sensing images with support vector machines", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing", "year": 2004, "id": "87b295cc-6eba-43a7-a7ef-8550597d52d5"}
{"abstract": "Autonomic computing systems are designed to be self-diagnosing and self-healing, such that they detect performance and correctness problems, identify their causes, and react accordingly. These abilities can improve performance, availability, and security, while simultaneously reducing the effort and skills required of system administrators. One way that systems can support these abilities is by allowing monitoring code, diagnostic code, and function implementations to be dynamically inserted and removed in live systems. This \"hot swapping\" avoids the requisite prescience and additional complexity inherent in creating systems that have all possible configurations built in ahead of time. For already-complex pieces of code such as operating systems, hot swapping provides a simpler, higher-performance, and more maintainable method of achieving autonomic behavior. In this paper, we discuss hot swapping as a technique for enabling autonomic computing in systems software. First, we discuss its advantages and describe the required system structure. Next, we describe K42, a research operating system that explicitly supports interposition and replacement of active operating system code.

{"abstract": "Real time systems distinguish themselves by explicitly stating timing constraints in the system specification. This requires specific methods and tools in system design to ensure such constraints. We focus on one of the methods applied in the validation phase, namely formal verification. This method automatically establishes correctness of the system model with mathematical rigor. In order to apply mechanical procedures to determine whether the system satisfies the requirements, we first have to model the validated part of the system in a mathematical form. This thesis deals with one such formalism - timed automata - and investigates different types of infinite state structures arising in the verification procedures related to this formalism. There are two different views which open the door for introduction of such structures. First, we turn outwards and extend timed automata with additional infinite data structures - unbounded queues. These queues serve different purposes. In one case, the queues contain computation tasks and, together with a timed automaton, model a real-time system with tasks. The problem of interest in this setting is schedulability analysis. We investigate the decidability boundary in presence of various features such as preemption, variable computation times of tasks, and communication between the timed automaton and the task queue. In the other case, we use queues for asynchronous communication between timed automata running synchronously in parallel. These queues store messages issued by one automaton and waiting to be read by another automaton. Such situations occur among other cases in real-time control systems where several concurrently running tasks communicate via buffers. We study the decidability border for reachability analysis depending on various communication topologies of these systems. Secondly, we turn inwards and study a peculiar feature of timed automata which allows them to enforce behaviors where time distances between events monotonically grow while being bounded by some integer. This feature can be characterized by unbounded counters recording the number of such enforced increases. When we switch from the dense time semantics used for modeling to an implementation with a fixed clock rate (sampled semantics), only behaviors which correspond to a bounded usage of these counters are preserved. We describe operation of these counters as a new type of a counter automaton and prove that one can effectively check whether the counters are used in a bounded way. As a result, it is possible to check for a given timed automaton whether there is an implementation with a fixed sampling rate which preserves all qualitative behaviors.", "authors": ["Pavel Krcal", "Parosh Aziz Abdulla", "Wang Yi"], "n_citation": 19, "references": ["05963671-2f1d-4eba-9a1d-7bd70550ebb9", "260b34ec-bd5e-487e-9e8a-b479dc679345", "37e7d8e8-2563-44e6-b9f1-a1a62815d7fb", "3c0e9eea-7332-4351-9451-ca8acfb5cc15", "3c309e6e-d8d2-4cf1-b4a2-21433c5b5591", "5fbbba76-4a6e-4ffc-b079-dfa8a02dd1bb", "8bd3734f-12b3-4209-99b9-2ce18558853f", "959fcc64-3813-4bbe-9dd5-e3993507ee5e", "a184d040-f1da-47fd-a4b2-73727fb3b01b", "b861b1ce-2c1d-407b-b434-95245d34f286", "c010f0b8-0d0b-425c-be6f-3c6e4a8e6ff8", "cfb45ac7-8298-4dba-8daa-555a1ce05acf", "e741a342-1c37-4eae-854e-0abf5bd1b294", "fefd3f96-47a7-4e26-b6e1-b0b692124a11"], "title": "Sampled Semantics of Timed Automata", "venue": "Logical Methods in Computer Science", "year": 2010, "id": "0168e63b-b382-4179-9bed-b530628f78e5"}

{"abstract": "The Expedited Forwarding Per-hop Behavior (EF PHB) was recently replaced by a new definition, called Packet Scale Rate Guarantee (PSRG), under the Differentiated Services (DiffServ) framework. This replacement raises two challenges. One is the implementation of PSRG server. Another is the provision of per-domain PSRG. To address the first challenge, we introduce a new concept called Latency-Rate Worst-case Service Guarantee (LR-WSG). We prove that if a server provides LR-WSG, it also provides PSRG. We show that many well-known schedulers support LR-WSG, which include not only one-level schedulers but also their hierarchical versions. To address the second challenge, we first prove that PSRG can be extended from per-node to per-domain if no flow aggregation is performed. The proof is notable in that it depends solely on the concept of PSRG itself. We then investigate the provision of per-domain PSRG in presence of flow aggregation. We propose to use Packet Scale Fair Aggregator (PSFA) to aggregate flows. We show that with PSFA, per-domain PSRG can be provided in spite of flow aggregation. We finally provide a brief discuss on the viability of using PSFA in DiffServ networks and define an Expedited Forwarding Perdomain Behavior (EF PDB).", "authors": ["Yuming Jiang"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["077aa70e-b736-42af-ab8f-d41fb52c2150", "4b754325-cef7-446b-88c0-66fda4334cd4", "4d4e1e00-9db4-49f8-aeb3-0213731d2c5b", "7966b1a7-c08a-4af7-9f00-0d4eee274215", "7bd60d03-1ff4-4aab-a47a-697741ee93c8", "7ee04ced-0d72-46cf-813c-5b8b534f4b22", "9df293fc-f5c0-4a69-aca4-e7b1a67cf33f", "b8c0b732-179f-48c3-86c7-a4f3a283a08a", "c31acf6c-c517-4afb-86ba-331ee8105e90", "ebe207cb-1563-47f4-b158-0b37b1b9acbe", "eef4f320-e822-4348-881a-e835a642c132", "f5d62ddc-2ef1-4863-aa74-82735150beaf", "fd2670f1-4cf9-401c-a307-d20d5c86c27e"], "title": "Per-domain packet scale rate guarantee for expedited forwarding", "venue": "international workshop on quality of service", "year": 2003, "id": "a8d94eb0-3a8a-4691-8e22-6713c0ef7fd9"}

{"abstract": "There is currently great interest in using fixed arrays of FPGAs for logic emulators, custom computing devices, and software accelerators. An important part of designing such a system is determining the proper routing topology to use to interconnect the FPGAs. This topology can have a great effect on the area and delay of the resulting system. Tree, bipartite graph, and mesh inter-connection schemes have all been proposed for use in FPGA-based systems. In this paper we examine mesh interconnection schemes, and propose several constructs for more efficient topologies. These reduce inter-chip delays by more than 60% over the basic 4-way Mesh. >", "authors": ["Scott Hauck", "Gaetano Borriello", "Carl Ebeling"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["4c51c72a-6abc-44fe-8926-c1f5b70e398a", "6b6e8569-e51c-49e3-8b36-7cd802bbdcf9", "a9292758-d4e8-47c3-9515-1ac17cefc9b5", "be96a6be-8895-4561-a188-5a72be614273", "d15c0b31-4a3d-46f6-96ac-bd9de9f02df8"], "title": "Mesh routing topologies for multi-FPGA systems", "venue": "international conference on computer design", "year": 1994, "id": "f54fcf9d-063e-4ed6-b13a-dc58df168772"}
{"abstract": "This paper introduces Forensic Feature Extraction (FFE) and Cross-Drive Analysis (CDA), two new approaches for analyzing large data sets of disk images and other forensic data. FFE uses a variety of lexigraphic techniques for extracting information from bulk data; CDA uses statistical techniques for correlating this information within a single disk image and across multiple disk images. An architecture for these techniques is presented that consists of five discrete steps: imaging, feature extraction, first-order cross-drive analysis, cross-drive correlation, and report generation. CDA was used to analyze 750 images of drives acquired on the secondary market; it automatically identified drives containing a high concentration of confidential financial records as well as clusters of drives that came from the same organization. FFE and CDA are promising techniques for prioritizing work and automatically identifying members of social networks under investigation.

{"abstract": "The amount of data produced by ubiquitous computing applications is quickly growing, due to the pervasive presence of small devices endowed with sensing, computing and communication capabilities. Heterogeneity and strong interdependence, which characterize 'ubiquitous data', require a (multi-)relational approach to their analysis. However, relational data mining algorithms do not scale well and very large data sets are hardly processable. In this paper we propose an extension of a relational algorithm for multi-level frequent pattern discovery, which resorts to data sampling and distributed computation in Grid environments, in order to overcome the computational limits of the original serial algorithm. The set of patterns discovered by the new algorithm approximates the set of exact solutions found by the serial algorithm. The quality of approximation depends on three parameters: the proportion of data in each sample, the minimum support thresholds and the number of samples in which a pattern has to be frequent in order to be considered globally frequent. Considering that the first two parameters are hardly controllable, we focus our investigation on the third one. Theoretically derived conclusions are also experimentally confirmed. Moreover, an additional application in the context of event log mining proves the viability of the proposed approach to relational frequent pattern mining from very large data sets.", "authors": ["Annalisa Appice", "Michelangelo Ceci", "Antonio Turi", "Donato Malerba"], "n_citation": 24, "references": ["0f115eea-2272-431f-9f21-6d6789b2bbc9", "146c0135-1fec-486d-8c33-86a1cd9d029b", "1f226ef7-3557-45b0-8aca-4b2a0f7f1827", "2a4d8731-1535-4f35-a276-e4dd74f04078", "3564c942-2b33-4871-abe9-dfd20a8b8aef", "3af1db81-ea45-4174-a65c-3c086556150a", "5a8a4d5b-d928-4871-afcc-9e0255fa0d02", "6aa3278b-5910-4142-994a-b813bc136741", "701397a1-a77e-460c-a42b-0d89b78d17f1", "71197683-7fda-43b3-bcdd-e8ddb42117f0", "7c374f78-a4c7-49f9-8f1a-08ff056102c9", "802199cf-6500-4456-8ec5-45668848ae01", "82bd36af-4236-4797-9614-e795f58e9968", "82c534c6-c89d-4856-b6fc-e1cad5be4482", "959299af-3dd0-491f-aeec-635e1b7fed7e", "9d7a0abf-7871-497a-8282-d5859bf580c7", "c1397a45-8a67-465d-857b-0b50b89ce066", "c83d10cb-3cc4-4c8a-ad85-1eb92e76b337", "d91ac95c-21cc-429e-b8e3-bdf65837b8cd", "e97695ef-712a-43d7-b685-5ead1dce1139", "ecd6a845-8439-49b0-abe8-f71fff81da23", "ed514028-0a86-4009-ac30-7791ffea680a", "fbdedd40-b9f0-4d4f-9c44-a4f592d11342"], "title": "A parallel, distributed algorithm for relational frequent pattern discovery from very large data sets", "venue": "intelligent data analysis", "year": 2011, "id": "526453f3-6e3e-482d-a256-6cfd23966367"}

{"abstract": "This paper deals with logics of programs. The objective is to formalize a notion of program description and to give both plausible (semantic) and effective (syntactic) criteria for the notion of truth of a description. A novel feature of this treatment is the development of the mathematics underlying Floyd-Hoare axiom systems independently of such systems. Other directions that such research might take are also considered. This paper grew out of, and is intended to be usable as, class notes for an introductory semantics course. The three sections of the paper are: 1) A frame work for the logic of programs. Programs and their partial correctness theories are treated as binary relations on states and formulae respectively. Truth-values are assigned to partial correctness assertions in a plausible (Tarskian) but not directly usable way. 2) Particular Programs. Effective criteria for truth are established for some programs using the Tarskian criteria as a benchmark. This leads directly to a sound, complete, effective axiom system for the theories of these programs. The difficulties involved in finding such effective criteria for other programs are explored. 3) Variations and extensions of the framework. Alternatives to binary relations for both programs and theories are speculated on, and their possible roles in semantics are considered. We discuss a hierarchy of varieties of programs and the importance of this hierarchy to the issues of definability and describability. Modal logic is considered as a first-order alternative to Floyd-Hoare logic. We give an appropriate axiom system which is complete for loop-free programs and also puts conventional predicate calculus in a different light by lumping quantifiers with non-logical assignments rather than treating them as logical concepts.", "authors": ["Vaughan R.

We also propose a method based on a multi-objective genetic algorithm for finding a set of non-dominated solutions. We examine the performance of the proposed methods by applying them to the well-known iris data.

{"abstract": "Multi-Identity Single-Key Decryption (MISKD) is an Identity-Based Encryption (IBE) system where a private decryption key can map multiple public keys (identities). More exactly, in MISKD, a single private key can be used to decrypt multiple ciphertexts encrypted with different public keys associated to the private key. MISKD is a variant of IBE and offers convenience to users who have to manage many private keys in a standard IBE. The notion of MISKD was recently introduced by Guo, Mu and Chen in Pairing 2007. They proposed a concrete MISKD scheme and proved its security based on the Bilinear Strong Diffie-Hellman problem ( q -BSDH) in random oracle model. In this paper, we present a novel MISKD scheme that is provably secure in the selective-ID model based on the Decisional Bilinear Diffie-Hellman (DBDH) assumption.

{"abstract": "As the Internet makes the transition from research testbed to commercial enterprise, the topic of pricing in computer networks has suddenly attracted great attention. Much of the discussion in the network design community and the popular press centers on the usage-based  vs.  flat pricing debate. The more academic literature has largely focused on devising optimal pricing policies; achieving optimal welfare requires charging marginal congestion costs for usage. In this paper we critique this  optimality  paradigm on three grounds: (1) marginal cost prices may not produce sufficient revenue to fully recover costs and so are perhaps of limited relevance, (2) congestion costs are inherently inaccessible to the network and so cannot reliably form the basis for pricing, and (3) there are other, more structural, goals besides optimality, and some of these goals are incompatible with the global uniformity required for optimal pricing schemes. For these reasons, we contend that the research agenda on pricing in computer network should shift away from the optimality paradigm and focus more on structural and architectural issues. Such issues include allowing local control of pricing policies, fostering interconnection, handling multicast appropriately, and allowing receivers to pay for transmission. To illustrate our point, we describe how these goals might be accomplished in the context of a different pricing paradigm:  edge  pricing. In addition, we argue that in the context of this edge pricing paradigm, usage-based pricing and flat pricing are not radically different but instead both reside along the single continuum of  usage-constraining  pricing policies.", "authors": ["Scott Shenker", "David D.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a framework in which Lagrangian particle dynamics is used for the segmentation of high density crowd flows and detection of flow instabilities. For this purpose, a flow field generated by a moving crowd is treated as an aperiodic dynamical system. A grid of particles is overlaid on the flow field, and is advected using a numerical integration scheme. The evolution of particles through the flow is tracked using a flow map, whose spatial gradients are subsequently used to setup a Cauchy Green deformation tensor for quantifying the amount by which the neighboring particles have diverged over the length of the integration. The maximum eigenvalue of the tensor is used to construct a finite time Lyapunov exponent (FTLE) field, which reveals the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS) present in the underlying flow. The LCS divide flow into regions of qualitatively different dynamics and are used to locate boundaries of the flow segments in a normalized cuts framework. Any change in the number of flow segments over time is regarded as an instability, which is detected by establishing correspondences between flow segments over time.

Online, matching involves a simultaneous coarse-to-fine approach over the shape hierarchy and over the transformation parameters.

{"abstract": "A layered approach to the specification and verification of real-time systems is described. Application processes are specified in the CSR Application Language, which includes high-level language constructs such as timeouts, deadlines, periodic processes, interrupts, and exception handling. A configuration schema is used to map the processes to system resources, and to specify the communication links between them. The authors automatically translate the result of the mapping into the CCSR process algebra, which characterizes CSR's resource-based computation model by a prioritized transition system. For the purposes of verification, a reachability analyzer based on the CCSR semantics has been implemented. This tool mechanically evaluates the correctness of the CSR specification by checking whether an exception state can be reached in its corresponding CCSR term. The effectiveness of this technique is illustrated by a multisensor robot example. >", "authors": ["Richard Gerber", "Insup Lee"], "n_citation": 76, "references": ["0a98aa87-6cd2-43ac-a5e9-9128e9db3f68", "0d261b6a-c94a-4d5e-b44e-eb6ae46581fc", "15b87b24-f97f-4144-90ea-998c72f6eade", "15c7d9e6-83f1-4e00-b2d5-204766d6b219", "16d744db-d604-4f2d-9ed2-6201f79b29c1", "1d8e3fd7-8d25-45e2-a873-64561e9c0e8e", "26a4bdca-1c87-48b1-914e-d35803d3b950", "30aed0bc-8322-49df-9dc5-cb0e87d357a9", "387e7cbe-e4ec-4bbd-b475-e0f63fcce478", "426221c7-8af6-4958-bb8d-ee173c1697a4", "4a256239-36e9-437c-8e5d-b8224b487060", "4b8d5647-b891-4bd0-b974-010bb0a27d6f", "91807a3c-e6f9-43b7-b7de-9e0b9c07f5ae", "94502bdb-6258-4ac8-b06a-07e36d008f05", "9bfd6622-753e-4fee-aab2-2563418161bd", "b3fd2552-82d3-491e-a724-04be6f7e0689", "c7669549-1837-473b-b9fd-d3029f809ebd", "d5b1bac7-8e6a-44b0-ac02-153989aa3f3d", "e73c0a68-54c9-4e8b-a2a5-ffaea4e67f44", "fb131d64-c6b1-4221-ba2d-00cad0a22237"], "title": "A layered approach to automating the verification of real-time systems", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "year": 1992, "id": "ba3b34e7-d93e-4839-89c0-d8a29251c410"}

{"abstract": "Virtual enterprise integration is the task of improving the performance of a temporary alliance of globally distributed independent enterprises that participate in the different phases of the life cycle of a product or service by efficiently managing the interactions among the participants. This is a very complex task that involves different approaches regarding technology, management and cultural elements. There are different proposals for enterprise integration (usually called Reference Architectures) that have been very useful in applications for a single-enterprise. However, they need to be adapted to support the new requirements that appear in virtual enterprise integration. This paper shows the modifications applied to ARDIN (Spanish acronyrn of Reference Architecture for INtegrated Development) to help in the design and management of an efficient and flexible virtual enterprise.

{"abstract": "Using the right software is increasingly critical to project success, but the choices keep getting wider and more confusing. Open source software (OSS) has entered the mix, leaving the traditional confines of the hacker community and entering large-scale, well-publicized applications. However, although some argue that it is ready for wide-scale commercial adaptation and deployment, the myriad number of OSS packages make actual adoption a real challenge. This article presents a straightforward and practical roadmap to navigate your OSS adoption considerations. We do not have a universally accepted definition of OSS. For instance, Netscape, Sun Microsystems, and Apple recently introduced what they call \"community-source\" versions of their popular software-the Mozilla project, Solaris, and MacOS X, respectively. Such efforts, while validating the OSS concept, also make their inclusion into the OSS community a potential topic for contention. We use the loose definition of OSS that includes publicly available source code and community-source software.", "authors": ["Huaiqing Wang", "Chen Wang"], "n_citation": 90, "references": ["223acc2a-0c16-47a1-9f4c-c0adc777df63", "42721257-489c-4dbe-b5e5-ee511e9a39f2"], "title": "Open source software adoption: a status report", "venue": "IEEE Software", "year": 2001, "id": "46df53ae-4beb-4d88-a444-6a3077a63bda"}
{"abstract": "We consider parity games played on special pushdown graphs, namely those generated by one-counter processes. For parity games on pushdown graphs, it is known from [23] that deciding the winner is an ExpTime-complete problem. An important corollary of this result is that the \u03bc-calculus model checking problem for pushdown processes is ExpTime-complete. As one-counter processes are special cases of pushdown processes, it follows that deciding the winner in a parity game played on the transition graph of a one-counter process can be achieved in ExpTime. Nevertheless the proof for the ExpTime-hardness lower bound of [23] cannot be adapted to that case. Therefore, a natural question is whether the ExpTime upper bound can be improved in this special case. In this paper, we adapt techniques from [11,4] and provide a PSpace upper bound and a DP-hard lower bound for this problem. We also give two important consequences of this result. First, we improve the best upper bound known for model-checking one-counter processes against \u03bc-calculus. Second, we show how these games can be used to solve pushdown games with winning conditions that are Boolean combinations of a parity condition on the control states with conditions on the stack height.", "authors": ["Olivier Serre"], "n_citation": 64, "references": ["02de5106-8acc-4ca6-9861-4805210ab776", "0878bb1f-bd01-4193-a200-844a06603f3e", "09fc7b5d-9220-4088-bdac-eb79cddc9675", "1ef74256-a040-47b4-81a2-8ab106c83bb7", "25dcb334-c97c-4089-a326-b0d3647212dd", "39373ca0-3987-4dca-8c7a-182f1db17b4a", "42f96654-a663-4323-9c8d-3f6bb0b71c49", "5e4f5f95-a58e-4c3e-b017-610425069a0c", "61bb9ac9-de07-4a8b-9d84-aed849105d0c", "99303c22-6ab5-4980-9294-c96a030d32b1", "aaa21a20-35e6-45a3-a744-8b74357a4925", "af99af8c-a898-486e-934c-82de92f91a9c", "bbc3c517-d030-4c6b-80da-94555b94e286", "c0b8ad21-00ac-4630-ba45-7465c615d69e", "c7dc486b-94c4-4fe4-b1bd-ed4099d1947b", "d507beaa-7cb1-4c6c-9fc2-c2864ab8f4ab", "d88b2707-a0de-40d2-b4aa-4ded2cd19eb3", "dc80a704-7cf2-4f34-ac1a-716106fb2703"], "title": "Parity games played on transition graphs of one-counter processes", "venue": "foundations of software science and computation structure", "year": 2006, "id": "8080b041-a0ae-4303-a808-7c2cbce418bf"}

{"abstract": "Many organizations are now starting to introduce crowdsourcing as a new model of business to outsource tasks, which are traditionally performed by a small group of people, to an undefined large workforce. While the utilization of crowdsourcing offers a lot of advantages, the development of the required system carries some risks, which are reduced by establishing a profound theo- retical foundation. Thus, this article strives to gain a better understanding of what crowdsourcing systems are and what typical design aspects are considered in the development of such systems. In this paper, the author conducted a sys- tematic literature review in the domain of crowdsourcing systems. As a result, 17 definitions of crowdsourcing systems were found and categorized into four perspectives: the organizational, the technical, the functional, and the human- centric.

{"abstract": "The C preprocessor ( CPP ) is a simple and language-independent tool, widely used to implement variable software systems using conditional compilation (i.e., by including or excluding annotated code). Although  CPP  provides powerful means to express variability, it has been criticized for allowing arbitrary annotations that break the underlying structure of the source code. We distinguish between  disciplined  annotations, which align with the structure of the source code, and  undisciplined  annotations, which do not. Several studies suggest that especially the latter type of annotations makes it hard to (automatically) analyze the code. However, little is known about whether the type of annotations has an effect on program comprehension. We address this issue by means of a controlled experiment with human subjects. We designed similar tasks for both, disciplined and undisciplined annotations, to measure program comprehension. Then, we measured the performance of the subjects regarding correctness and response time for solving the tasks. Our results suggest that there are no differences between disciplined and undisciplined annotations from a program-comprehension perspective. Nevertheless, we observed that finding and correcting errors is a time-consuming and tedious task in the presence of preprocessor annotations.", "authors": ["Sandro Schulze", "J\u00f6rg Liebig", "Janet Siegmund", "Sven Apel"], "n_citation": 24, "references": ["12e563d2-4f59-4fd5-a2db-779b05d16538", "2fe7c094-9c39-471d-9d2a-f1fc6b37e8ff", "3a56a04c-8990-42ab-a14f-85eeb20e8e38", "4cc9c8d4-3dfc-42d0-8b54-f3587d7348db", "51154562-31e0-4e9b-b1e8-95b282288abd", "5e1d6fa3-7081-441b-9529-1214f1807102", "7f1a8258-1ab4-4598-b022-c97d2cae7553", "821ddf07-abf5-4cf5-9772-50e51ae5eace", "a1a5a9a2-bcf6-485b-8b21-42861c4e096c", "a8bab92e-f8d7-4c59-a078-c9f4dcb4d299", "ae1ac976-6c67-41d6-b4e9-e9c30a460e75", "ae2bdea7-0458-4f91-a561-29a7c758ea74", "afee7de6-cd03-42f3-927e-77b0f2c0fcee", "b01a8684-4324-41c0-ae95-b78ee2d56201", "b0bc50d9-741e-4794-b271-a27c597a24ab", "db5685d0-8acc-434c-89a4-9fa3ee14367d", "e9205b9a-1a63-4af1-be63-23824432bfac", "f9b93fec-3e61-4d87-aa4a-81fecc09177f", "fbab723e-0028-4406-a3a4-dcf27dd6554e"], "title": "Does the discipline of preprocessor annotations matter?: a controlled experiment", "venue": "Sigplan Notices", "year": 2014, "id": "c5a191d8-0070-4c7d-9460-489c16331a75"}

{"abstract": "Applications implemented as distributed systems must withstand network partitioning faults, which split the system into two or more components. Though processes in the same component can communicate with each other, they cannot communicate with processes in other components. If processes continue to operate in the disconnected components, they might perform incompatible operations and make the application data inconsistent. A real-world business cannot stop operating if the network partitions. The authors have developed a strategy that permits processing to continue in all components of a partitioned network. The processes in the disconnected components generate and queue fulfilment transactions that record the actions taken while the network is partitioned. When communication is restored and the components remerge, the fulfilment transactions are dequeued and processed to obtain a consistent state of the application data. Fulfilment transactions allow continued operations, require little additional infrastructure, incur little additional overhead, and are programmed just like other types of transactions.", "authors": ["P.

{"abstract": "We develop an effective representational and inferential framework for fully deadline-coupled planning and acting in hard, non-extensible, unforeseen deadline situations. While meta-planning is the usual proposal for reasoning about the reasoning process, few formalisms to date acknowledge that meta-planning takes time too. In traditional mechanisms, the planning effort is treated as a different kind of beast, not an action itself that takes time. A paradigmatic time-critical problem scenario was chosen: Nell, Dudley and the railroad tracks. Nell is tied to the railroad tracks and a train approaches. Dudley, the agent, must formulate a plan to save her and carry it out before the oncoming train reaches her.#R##N#We design a time-situated inference mechanism based on an underlying framework of active logics. We demonstrate the generality of our formal methods by using them to tackle projection issues in some real-time versions of the canonical Yale Shooting Problem.#R##N#In a realistic setting, an agent planning under time-pressure must also measure up to two other crucial resource limitations as well, namely, space and computation bounds. We introduce a limited short-term memory combined with a primitive relevance mechanism, and a limited-capacity inference engine. We propose heuristics to maximize an agent's chances of meeting a deadline in this enhanced framework.#R##N#Logical omniscience, and inferential closure are computational impossibilities for an agent embedded in a real environment. We construct a variation on active logics for which there is a sound and complete modal semantics. It overcomes the key obstacle of closure under consequence. This result illustrates the similarity and differences between active-logic approaches to knowledge and belief, and previous modal approaches.#R##N#To summarize the novel elements in this dissertation: we present a declarative planning framework based on active logics which can account for all the time taken to plan, making it suitable for deadline situations. We describe a novel treatment of temporal projection in a real-time setting, a modal semantics for active logics, and additional results in reasoning under resource limitations.

Components are described as timed automata with data ports, which can be composed in static structures of unidirectional control and data flow. Compositions can be encapsulated as components and used in other compositions to form hierarchical models. The proposed partial order reduction technique uses a local time semantics for timed automata, in which time may progress independently in parallel automata which are resynchronized when needed. To increase the number of independent transitions and to reduce the problem of re-synchronizing parallel automata we propose, and show how, to use information derived from the composition structure of an analyzed model. Based on these ideas, we present a reachability analysis algorithm that uses an ample set construction to select which symbolic transitions to explore.

{"abstract": "A desirable property of path planning for robotic manipulation is the ability to identify solutions in a sufficiently short amount of time to be usable. This is particularly challenging for the manipulation problem due to the need to plan over high-dimensional configuration spaces and to perform computationally expensive collision checking procedures. Consequently, existing planners take steps to achieve desired solution times at the cost of low quality solutions. This paper presents a planning algorithm that overcomes these difficulties by augmenting the asymptotically-optimal RRT* with a sparse sampling procedure. With the addition of a collision checking procedure that leverages memoization, this approach has the benefit that it quickly identifies low-cost feasible trajectories and takes advantage of subsequent computation time to refine the solution towards an optimal one. We evaluate the algorithm through a series of Monte Carlo simulations of seven, twelve, and fourteen degree of freedom manipulation planning problems in a realistic simulation environment. The results indicate that the proposed approach provides significant improvements in the quality of both the initial solution and the final path, while incurring almost no computational overhead compared to the RRT algorithm. We conclude with a demonstration of our algorithm for single-arm and dual-arm planning on Willow Garage's PR2 robot.", "authors": ["Alejandro Perez", "Sertac Karaman", "Alexander C.

There are two key requirements this description aims to address: first, it should ensure correct composition of the nested architectural abstractions (for design purposes); second, it should be easy-to-read so that an average user can identify a component with the correct semantics for the purposes of component trading. The semantic description in SOFA expresses the behavior of the component in terms of behavior protocols using a notation similar to regular expressions which is easy to read and comprehend. The behavior protocols are used on three levels: interface, frame, and architecture. The key achievements of the paper include the definition of the protocol conformance relation. Using this relation, the designer can in most cases statically verify that the frame protocol adheres to the requirements of the interface protocols, and that the architecture protocol adheres to the requirements of the frame and interface protocols.", "authors": ["Frantisek Plasil", "S.

{"abstract": "Many useful relations between the Gabor transform (GT) and the fractional Fourier transform (FRFT) have been derived. First, we find that, like the Wigner distribution function (WDF), the FRFT is also equivalent to the rotation operation of the GT. Then, we show that performing the scaled inverse Fourier transform (IFT) along an oblique line of the GT of f(t) can yield its FRFT. Since the GT is closely related to the FRFT, we can use it for analyzing the characteristics of the FRFT. Compared with the WDF, the GT does not have the cross-term problem. This advantage is important for the applications of filter design, sampling, and multiplexing in the FRFT domain. Moreover, we find that if the GT is combined with the WDF, the resultant operation [called the Gabor-Wigner transform (GWT)] also has rotation relation with the FRFT. We also derive the general form of the linear distribution that has rotation relation with the FRFT.", "authors": ["Soo-Chang Pei", "Jian-Jiun Ding"], "n_citation": 109, "references": ["304e5a2e-25f2-4179-a57a-fb75628e446a", "33d519a5-e5e3-4088-b941-1ec0586f22a9", "56969c9b-2d0f-4a8b-af56-87ba0f09ae25", "653f9fbd-350c-43d2-80a4-35294bbea498", "6df646dd-b15e-4bf5-8cc1-340c4fb780c8", "81210eb5-b264-4954-9e78-61dad92900b3", "a21599dc-93d3-4f8e-87b8-33c417c8f99f", "dec62285-3947-4a55-b780-2b63774431a7"], "title": "Relations Between Gabor Transforms and Fractional Fourier Transforms and Their Applications for Signal Processing", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing", "year": 2007, "id": "16d24531-cc3a-4a4c-9b84-18b35b2a475f"}
{"abstract": "Due to the popularity of the Internet and the powerful computing capability of computers, efficient processing/retrieval of multimedia data has become an important issue. In this paper, we propose a fast video retrieval algorithm that bases its search core on the statistics of object motion. The algorithm starts with extracting object motions from a shot and then transforms/quantizes them into the form of probability distributions. By choosing the shot that has the largest entropy value among the constituent shots of an unknown query video clip, we execute the first stage video search. By comparing two shots with different lengths, their corresponding motion probability distributions are compared by a discrete Bhattacharyya distance which is designed to measure the similarity between any two distribution functions. In the second stage, we add an adjacent shot (either preceding or subsequent) to perform a finer comparison.

{"abstract": "Abstract   Extensions of logic programming languages with structuring constructs have been extensively studied in the last years. A particularly clean approach consists in allowing implication goals to occur in goals and in clause bodies. Implication goals are implications of the form  D  \u21d2  G , where  D  is a set of clauses and  G  is a goal. The clauses in  D  are intended to be local to  G , as they can be used only in the proof of  G . So implication goals can be regarded as blocks of conventional programming languages and such an extension provides different kinds of block structured languages according to the visibility rules chosen for the local clauses. The choices are mainly two: either lexical (static) visibility rules or dynamic visibility rules. A further distinction can be made between closed and open blocks. In this paper we aim at showing that modal logic provides a unifying framework in which different logical languages with blocks and modules can be expressed. We show this by interpreting the different block languages within modal logic S4. Moreover, we will consider different kinds of modules that can be defined from blocks by introducing some syntactic sugar and compare them to other proposals in the literature.", "authors": ["Laura Giordano", "Alberto Martelli"], "n_citation": 36, "references": ["073036b8-766c-4f58-9c00-a7b4908057ac", "0b814641-04e1-42f8-bb1a-6e3529d436ba", "2604fcde-b66d-4f8e-8fdd-f9274a448a83", "27674447-45ce-4cd2-b7eb-eb501f7f790b", "2c6c8d8e-4c47-4f83-9dbe-6d3c967a77db", "3bc30f5c-9fda-4ea4-9111-01041c67763d", "60311eaa-b8b3-4dce-8889-281739d8175a", "69a49c13-83c2-4285-bc6b-5609850c3d72", "7b4837aa-1d33-42af-a438-e2efd680b568", "82297db3-1b58-4432-ae58-7d93d18c2ab9", "94b4608b-8487-43df-bec1-ffd4a52d9624", "ac617709-0d4c-45e6-ae0a-d401f438a27b", "c2089f48-082f-4728-8678-8584ec018305", "c8c82b57-aa11-4bfd-9d38-a0f7269847f6", "c919a055-086a-4199-a012-2c36240a58bf", "e17630f8-9609-4fdd-b49b-08673e8ecb95", "e3273689-04f1-4d56-a424-96cebe11d9a0", "e886552f-1b7e-4bd4-bfa0-f4ce86e69022", "eafea9c0-c5bf-4c99-976a-578e7335eebc", "ed83f565-e420-4053-a776-a485eac6a83d", "f1c2dbb9-504e-454e-b6ca-7f472f84f2ee", "f2d5efaa-7cb1-4c1d-8764-3157c5189230"], "title": "Structuring logic programs: a modal approach\u2606", "venue": "Journal of Logic Programming", "year": 1994, "id": "38ccedf2-c3c3-43c5-a5d9-9d3eeb02471a"}

{"abstract": "We introduce a computing mechanism of a biochemical inspiration (similar to a P system from the area of Computing with Membranes) which consists of a multiset of symbol-objects and a set of finite state transducers. The transducers process symbols in the current multiset in the usual manner. A computation starts in an initial configuration and ends in a halting configuration. The power of these mechanisms is investigated, as well as the closure properties of the obtained family. The main results say that (1) systems with two components and an unbounded number of states in each component generate all gsm images of all permutation closures of recursively enumerable languages, while (2) systems with two states in each component but an unbounded number of components can generate the permutation closures of all recursively enumerable languages, and (3) the obtained family is a full AFL.

The dynamic behavior of the flexible riser is represented by a distributed parameter system with partial differential equations (PDEs) and the control is applied at the top boundary of the riser based on Lyapunov's direct method to regulate the riser's vibrations. With the proposed boundary control, uniform boundedness under ocean current disturbance, and exponential stability under free vibration condition can be achieved. The proposed control is independent of system parameters, which ensures the robustness of the system to variations in parameters.

{"abstract": "Power-law distributions occur in many situations of scientific interest and have significant consequences for our understanding of natural and man-made phenomena. Unfortunately, the detection and characterization of power laws is complicated by the large fluctuations that occur in the tail of the distribution\u2014the part of the distribution representing large but rare events\u2014and by the difficulty of identifying the range over which power-law behavior holds. Commonly used methods for analyzing power-law data, such as least-squares fitting, can produce substantially inaccurate estimates of parameters for power-law distributions, and even in cases where such methods return accurate answers they are still unsatisfactory because they give no indication of whether the data obey a power law at all. Here we present a principled statistical framework for discerning and quantifying power-law behavior in empirical data. Our approach combines maximum-likelihood fitting methods with goodness-of-fit tests based on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic and likelihood ratios. We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach with tests on synthetic data and give critical comparisons to previous approaches. We also apply the proposed methods to twenty-four real-world data sets from a range of different disciplines, each of which has been conjectured to follow a power-law distribution. In some cases we find these conjectures to be consistent with the data, while in others the power law is ruled out.", "authors": ["Aaron Clauset", "Cosma Rohilla Shalizi", "M. E. J.

{"abstract": "An exponential family or mixture family of probability distributions has a natural hierarchical structure. This paper gives an \"orthogonal\" decomposition of such a system based on information geometry. A typical example is the decomposition of stochastic dependency among a number of random variables. In general, they have a complex structure of dependencies. Pairwise dependency is easily represented by correlation, but it is more difficult to measure effects of pure triplewise or higher order interactions (dependencies) among these variables. Stochastic dependency is decomposed quantitatively into an \"orthogonal\" sum of pairwise, triplewise, and further higher order dependencies. This gives a new invariant decomposition of joint entropy. This problem is important for extracting intrinsic interactions in firing patterns of an ensemble of neurons and for estimating its functional connections. The orthogonal decomposition is given in a wide class of hierarchical structures including both exponential and mixture families. As an example, we decompose the dependency in a higher order Markov chain into a sum of those in various lower order Markov chains.", "authors": ["Shun-ichi Amari"], "n_citation": 359, "references": ["0e2afba3-c7e5-4af4-9ea3-d2ec3742cbd9", "0e816648-cf46-4159-a232-958d65de2afe", "3400247b-27d0-4a0d-a927-94d1bd1f8115", "39c9cdf2-9b6f-4cdd-b708-f6bcad8b6e87", "3cac37fd-2fd8-44fb-ad4f-392a4058473a", "5f2359c5-3640-4fe7-951c-e55f5afeb764", "68069437-ef93-4af7-af5c-adeaaae09efc", "8dbf796c-906c-404a-8d28-99d5845e28a8", "cedef43b-ded7-4d62-9b19-993d06773d71"], "title": "Information geometry on hierarchy of probability distributions", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Information Theory", "year": 2001, "id": "05797dfd-cedb-4c0a-b2db-513c731235d1"}

{"abstract": "Traditionally, secure cryptographic algorithms provide secu- rity against an adversary who has only black-box access to the secret information of honest parties. However, such models are not always ad- equate. In particular, the security of these algorithms may completely break under (feasible) attacks that tamper with the secret key. In this paper we propose a theoretical framework to investigate the algo- rithmic aspects related to tamper-proof security. In particular, we define a model of security against an adversary who is allowed to apply arbi- trary feasible functions f to the secret key sk, and obtain the result of the cryptographic algorithms using the new secret key f (sk). We prove that in the most general setting it is impossible to achieve this strong notion of security. We then show minimal additions to the model, which are needed in order to obtain provable security. We prove that these additions are necessary and also sufficient for most common cryptographic primitives, such as encryption and signature schemes. We discuss the applications to portable devices protected by PINs and show how to integrate PIN security into the generic security design. Finally we investigate restrictions of the model in which the tampering powers of the adversary are limited. These restrictions model realistic attacks (like differential fault analysis) that have been demonstrated in practice. In these settings we show security solutions that work even without the additions mentioned above.", "authors": ["Rosario Gennaro", "Anna Lysyanskaya", "Tal Malkin", "Silvio Micali", "Tal Rabin"], "n_citation": 176, "references": ["033ebb72-0119-4cc9-89b8-f011c55ddd79", "48256bd6-01d8-41f8-828e-d2d0876d47e8", "4ef5e29d-bfa1-46e2-8e59-d52d060ef770", "7225aced-64d3-4dc6-b491-7eb2739b8828", "ba4d1a67-fbc8-4ad7-8091-f286c105aa28", "c77c7a91-a4a1-4874-b80a-7c7e2c36b051", "c7bcd008-1deb-4608-9a8d-19e7f3e02c04", "d7f731c6-59e5-4871-9c22-38af2701d8dd", "d893a420-a00d-4756-b447-2862ed178eaa", "e9650618-c45c-4a4f-adea-bd47e125977e", "f9f4d6e6-a830-4fe3-b7d1-36f6e700ed17"], "title": "Algorithmic tamper-proof (ATP) security: Theoretical foundations for security against hardware tampering", "venue": "theory of cryptography conference", "year": 2004, "id": "06e0acaa-ed6d-491a-8e6b-8ef4f01e6ff5"}

In this paper, we formally describe this class of temporally-extended CSPs and situate qualitative simulation within this description. This is followed by a description of the DecSIM algorithm which is used to incrementally generate all possible solutions to a temporally-extended CSP. DecSIM combines problem decomposition, a tree-clustering algorithm and ideas similar to directed arc--consistency to exploit structure and causality within a qualitative model resulting in an exponential speed-up in simulation time when compared to existing techniques.", "authors": ["Daniel J.

{"abstract": "This paper presents a semantic space profiler for parallel functional programs. Building on previous work in sequential profiling, our tools help programmers to relate runtime resource use back to program source code. Unlike many profiling tools, our profiler is based on a cost semantics. This provides a means to reason about performance without requiring a detailed understanding of the compiler or runtime system. It also provides a specification for language implementers. This is critical in that it enables us to separate cleanly the performance of the application from that of the language implementation.   Some aspects of the implementation can have significant effects on performance. Our cost semantics enables programmers to understand the impact of different scheduling policies while hiding many of the details of their implementations. We show applications where the choice of scheduling policy has asymptotic effects on space use. We explain these use patterns through a demonstration of our tools. We also validate our methodology by observing similar performance in our implementation of a parallel extension of Standard ML.", "authors": ["Daniel Spoonhower", "Guy E.

{"abstract": "The response of neurons to external stimuli greatly depends on the intrinsic dynamics of the network. Here, the intrinsic dynamics are modeled as coupling and the external input is modeled as shared and unshared noise. We assume the neurons are repetitively firing action potentials (i.e., neural oscillators), are weakly and identically coupled, and the external noise is weak. Shared noise can induce bistability between the synchronous and anti-phase states even though the anti-phase state is the only stable state in the absence of noise. We study the Fokker-Planck equation of the system and perform an asymptotic reduction \u03c10. The \u03c10 solution is more computationally efficient than both the Monte Carlo simulations and the 2D Fokker-Planck solver, and agrees remarkably well with the full system with weak noise and weak coupling. With moderate noise and coupling, \u03c10 is still qualitatively correct despite the small noise and coupling assumption in the asymptotic reduction.

{"abstract": "The inductionless induction (also called proof by consistency) approach for proving equations by induction from an equational theory, requires a consistency check for equational theories. A new method using test sets for checking consistency of an equational theory is proposed. Using this method, a variation of the Knuth-Bendix completion procedure can be used for automatically proving equations by induction. The method does not suffer from limitations imposed by the methods proposed by Musser as well as by Huet and Hullot, and is as powerful as Jouannaud and Kounalis' method based on ground-reducibility. A theoretical comparison of the test set method with Jouannaud and Kounalis' method is given showing that the test set method is generally much better. Both the methods have been implemented in RRL, Rewrite Rule Laboratory, a theorem proving environment based on rewriting techniques and completion. In practice also, the test set method is faster than Jouannaud and Kounalis' method. The test set construction can also be used to check for the sufficient-completeness property of equational axiomatizations including algebraic specifications of abstract data types as well as for identifying constructors in an algebraic specification.", "authors": ["Deepak Kapur", "Paliath Narendran", "Hantao Zhang"], "n_citation": 61, "references": ["01d41f9c-728d-449e-9127-5ec9aeaecf4a", "04a0b111-f18e-49d8-a1ec-a2f289d46961", "1e459f12-9ffa-43aa-8dcf-f22a6b8d2d5a", "22dbabeb-e974-4280-a35c-382a5b3dc021", "37fb8d45-e92b-41c2-921a-e1c87ea04568", "42c042b8-a13f-4607-9eb1-0205e2918577", "597b955e-6626-4482-a708-39c8f97d397c", "6fc9d62f-d0f7-4fbe-a1ff-ffd9ad952c61", "7181b1c1-c0c8-472f-a192-0abb01db9b86", "b4caf3e4-442a-4cf6-87e8-51dd3fd7a5fa", "b5676aa0-d380-4a55-9f8e-1117239710f7", "bbd4b1dc-c71f-48ea-bd43-02514c36409d", "c5fbaa1d-a03f-465c-8ca9-031db23d63d2", "d639a9e8-d3be-4f44-8cbc-86ded20646b9", "d9e4bd59-cdda-4293-be02-460669f6f75b"], "title": "Automating inductionless induction using test sets", "venue": "Journal of Symbolic Computation", "year": 1991, "id": "72bf69ea-e1cb-4e6b-97c4-ee6acd3e8b9f"}

{"abstract": "We study fairness when receivers in a multicast network can not subscribe to fractional layers. This case arises when the source hierarchically encodes its signal and the hierarchical structure is predetermined. Unlike the case of the fractional layer allocation, which has been studied extensively in (Sarkar and Tassiulas, 1999), bandwidth can be allocated in discrete chunks only. Fairness issues become vastly different. Computation of lexicographic optimal rate allocation becomes NP-hard in this case, while lexicographic optimal rate allocation is polynomial complexity computable when fractional layers can be allocated. Furthermore, the maxmin fair rate vector may not exist in this case. We introduce a new notion of fairness, maximal fairness. We propose a polynomial complexity algorithm for computation of maximally fair rates allocated to various source-destination pairs. Even though maximal fairness is a weaker notion of fairness, it coincides with lexicographic optimality and maxmin fairness, when maxmin fair rate allocation exists. So the algorithm for computing maximally fair rate allocation computes maxmin fair rate allocation, when the latter exists.", "authors": ["Saswati Sarkar", "Leandros Tassiulas"], "n_citation": 77, "references": ["005a8cc9-e26b-42b2-b65f-867ad09e28b9", "14dbcb0a-b6a3-4407-9a3c-0ce575e268c9", "1aca0153-134a-46f5-a9b5-439d3c608856", "359bfefd-c7d6-4f92-a392-0164a70facdc", "5cb1562e-d2c9-4f40-91f9-729cc36979b6", "678691d0-f25a-4c15-8c8f-fb15247a1e64", "74f31dad-0455-422f-ac04-8c26a3360919", "87c2fef0-480c-4803-810d-9e6be2bf41ef", "a9971648-429b-41b3-8ebc-e4c601098ff6", "b9c26d61-9f87-4970-a982-607d4549435f", "c40d022a-c7ca-41d1-8725-f1e4faa11f86", "c5575a14-5bae-4149-a32d-8bec149f63a6", "c661de12-d434-4abd-9246-78ab70296bbd", "c91743b6-561a-4030-ba29-9ee12531d100", "d632b776-d9b1-430d-b0cb-aa2aa40d1c05", "e1c7443f-fbc7-4edc-919b-8f3bd2c1a34c", "e686a21e-de1a-4c46-9008-f1aabef956ee"], "title": "Fair allocation of discrete bandwidth layers in multicast networks", "venue": "international conference on computer communications", "year": 2000, "id": "0d78381a-16df-41ca-aa6c-1b251f78bde6"}

{"abstract": "We introduce Plushie, an interactive system that allows nonprofessional users to design their own original plush toys. To design a plush toy, one needs to construct an appropriate two-dimensional (2D) pattern. However, it is difficult for non-professional users to appropriately design a 2D pattern. Some recent systems automatically generate a 2D pattern for a given three-dimensional (3D) model, but constructing a 3D model is itself a challenge. Furthermore, an arbitrary 3D model cannot necessarily be realized as a real plush toy, and the final sewn result can be very different from the original 3D model. We avoid this mismatch by constructing appropriate 2D patterns and applying simple physical simulation to it on the fly during 3D modeling. In this way, the model on the screen is always a good approximation of the final sewn result, which makes the design process much more efficient. We use a sketching interface for 3D modeling and also provide various editing operations tailored for plush toy design. Internally, the system constructs a 2D cloth pattern in such a way that the simulation result matches the user's input stroke. Our goal is to show that relatively simple algorithms can provide fast, satisfactory results to the user whereas the pursuit of optimal layout and simulation accuracy lies outside this paper's scope.

Several strategies have been proposed over the last two decades for rewriting, the most efficient of all being the natural rewriting strategy [9]. All the strategies so far, including natural rewriting, assume that the given term rewriting system is a left-linear constructor system. Although these restrictions are reasonable for some functional programming languages, they limit the expressive power of equational languages, and they preclude certain applications of rewriting to equational theorem proving and to languages combining equational and logic programming. In this paper, we propose a conservative generalization of natural rewriting that does not require the rules to be left-linear and constructor-based.

In this study, we propose conjoint analysis based on rough sets approximated by dominance relations. In our formulation, qualitative data often used in the conventional method are transformed into ordered values by dominance relations using interval regression analysis.

The hardware acceleration is achieved through graphics processors,  gpu s.

Delicate tuning has resulted in strong scaling with parallel efficiency of 0.8 for 256 and 0.5 for 512  gpu s. The largest application run, with over 20 million atoms and one billion unknowns, required only one minute on 512  gpu s.

{"abstract": "Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) and its variants are well-known methods for solving the  c -approximate NN Search problem in high-dimensional space. Traditionally, several LSH functions are concatenated to form a \"static\" compound hash function for building a hash table.

Our theoretical studies show that, by appropriately choosing the size of LSH function base  m  and the collision threshold  l , C2LSH can have a guarantee on query quality. Notably, the parameter  m  is not affected by dimensionality of data objects, which makes C2LSH especially good for high dimensional NN search.

{"abstract": "Novel systems and algorithms have been designed and built to recognize affective patterns in physiological signals. Experiments were conducted for evaluation of the new systems and algorithms in three types of settings: a highly constrained laboratory setting, a largely unconstrained ambulatory environment, and a less unconstrained automotive environment. The laboratory experiment was designed to test for the presence of unique physiological patterns given a relatively motionless seated subject, intentionally expressing one of eight different emotions. This experiment generated a large dataset of physiological signals containing many day-today variations, and the proposed features contributed to a success rate of 81% for discriminating all eight emotions and up to 100% for subsets of emotion based on similar emotion qualities. For experiments in a largely unconstrained ambulatory setting, new wearable computer systems and sensors were developed and tested on subjects who walked, jogged, talked, and otherwise went about daily activities. Although physical motion often overwhelmed affective signals in this context, the systems developed in this thesis are currently useful as activity monitors, providing an image diary correlated with physiological signals. A third experiment was conducted in the natural but physically constrained environment of an automobile, generating a large database of physiological signals covering over 40 hours of driving data. This experiment was designed to induce varying amounts of stress in three conditions: rest, city diving and highway driving. Algorithms for detecting driver stress achieved a recognition rates of 96% for stress ratings based on task conditions and 89% accuracy using ratings of perceived stress from driver questionnaires. The results of second by second video coding of stressors by independent coders showed highly significant correlations with physiological features (up to r = .77 for over 4000 samples). Together, these three experiments show a range of success in recognizing affect from physiology, highlighting the need for more automatic context sensing in unconstrained conditions, and showing high recognition rates given somewhat constrained conditions.

{"abstract": "A methodology for extracting an extended Entity-Relationship (EER) model from a relational database is presented. Through a combination of data schema and data instance analysis, an EER model is derived which is semantically richer and more comprehensible for maintenance and design purposes than the original database. Classification schemes for relations and attributes necessary for the EER model extraction are derived and justified. These have been demonstrated to be implementable in a knowledge-based system; a working prototype system which does so is briefly discussed. In addition, cases in which human input is required are also clearly identified.

{"abstract": "The paper combines the Jayant adaptive quantization (Jayant, N.S., Bell Syst. Tech. J., vol.52, p.1119-44, 1973) and the gain prediction of G.728 to propose a scheme suitable for designing the gain codebook of LD-CELP, in which the exact gain value is adaptively predicted and adaptively quantized. In this method, for adaptive quantization gain of 3 bit and 4 bit, the SNR has been increased by 0.5 dB and 6 dB, respectively, compared to that of G.728. If 4-bit adaptive quantization and the shape codebook of 64 codevectors are adopted, the complexity of G.728 could be reduced by 20% while SNR has 1 dB improvement compared with G.728. When the order of the synthesis filter is reduced from 50 to 30, the SNR is not changed and the complexity of G.728 is decreased by 40%.", "authors": ["Gang Zhang", "Keming Xie", "Xueying Zhang", "Liying Huangfu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": [], "title": "Optimizing gain codebook of LD-CELP", "venue": "international conference on acoustics, speech, and signal processing", "year": 2003, "id": "9c1fdabc-33bc-4343-b2d2-6db093a96802"}
{"abstract": "The report presents empirical results of fine-grain communication on the 80-processor EM-X distributed-memory multiprocessor. EM-X has hardware support for low latency, high throughput fine-grain communication-this hardware support includes packet generation integrated into the instruction execution pipeline for single-cycle communication overhead, direct memory access for remote references, and rapid context switching for latency tolerance. The authors study the fine-grain communication performance of integer radix sort, a code with irregular communication, on EM-X, and compare it to the Fujitsu AP1000+ and the Cray Server CS6400. The experimental results indicate that EM-X achieves high throughput and low overhead for fine-grain communication. Whereas EM-X's communication performance scales perfectly as one increases the number of processors, other coarse-grain message-passing machines exhibit fluctuation and performance degradation for larger configurations due to network contention.", "authors": ["Yuetsu Kodama", "Hirofumi Sakane", "Koike Hanpei", "Mitsuhisa Sato", "Shuichi Sakai", "Yoshinori Yamaguchi"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["111fc858-5245-4b3f-966b-a735a958b567", "14d50635-2462-478b-9080-6347a61c3422", "1bc736cb-e33a-4b8a-90a7-eebc41776cc4", "2d339384-87c0-4640-b42e-800856da6903", "49f1324d-e63a-46a0-8e91-53532bd35fb6", "60a0d7b5-d5fe-47ac-bbb4-b485d8518cd1", "9cf0c694-8357-492e-afdd-666ca522b9a9", "a4f95e3a-17b0-46ed-a588-341d2bc53a33", "b50674be-da61-49f5-9aee-dfb022600d55", "c06328fb-ad3a-495d-8d16-259ffeda76a1"], "title": "Parallel execution of radix sort program using fine-grain communication", "venue": "international conference on parallel architectures and compilation techniques", "year": 1997, "id": "9ee8a0e2-4186-4cc0-b4ee-782baa8ca2c3"}

{"abstract": "In software testing, it is often desirable to find test inputs that exercise specific program features. To find these inputs by hand is extremely time-consuming, especially when the software is complex. Therefore, numerous attempts have been made to automate the process. Random test data generation consists of generating test inputs at random, in the hope that they will exercise the desired software features. Often, the desired inputs must satisfy complex constraints, and this makes a random approach seem unlikely to succeed. In contrast, combinatorial optimization techniques, such as those using genetic algorithms, are meant to solve difficult problems involving the simultaneous satisfaction of many constraints. In this paper, we discuss experiments with a test generation problem that is harder than the ones discussed in earlier literature-we use a larger program and more complex test adequacy criteria. We find a widening gap between a technique based on genetic algorithms and those based on random test generation.", "authors": ["Christoph C. Michael", "E Gary McGraw", "Michael Schatz", "C. C.

{"abstract": "Recent advances in Web engineering have enabled the rapid growth of dynamic Web services such as Web-based email, online banking, online shopping and entertainment. We envision that finding an effective way to deliver these dynamic Web services and understanding the relationship between Web application design and delivery are two important Web engineering issues, and have not been seriously considered in the community. In this paper, we intend to tackle the first problem and pave the way for solving the second problem in the future.#R##N##R##N#To efficiently serve this trend, several server-side and cache-side fragment-based techniques, which exploit reuse of Web pages at the sub-document (also known as fragment) level, have been proposed. Most of these techniques do not focus on the creation of the fragmented content from existing dynamic content. Also, existing caching techniques do not support fragment movement across the document, a common behavior in dynamic Web content.#R##N##R##N#This paper presents two proposals that we have suggested to solve these problems. The first, DyCA, a dynamic content adapter, takes original dynamic Web content and converts it to fragment-enabled content. Thus the dynamic parts of the document are separated into separate fragments from the static template of the document. This is dependent on our proposed keyword-based fragment detection approach that uses predefined keywords to find these fragments and to split them out of the core document. Our second proposal, an augmentation to the ESI standard, allows splitting the information of the position of each fragment in the template from the template data itself by using a mapping table. Using this, a fragment enabled cache can have a more fine grained level of identifying fragments independent of their location on the template, which enables it to take into account fragment behaviors such as fragment movement. We used the content taken from three real Web sites to achieve a detailed performance evaluation of our proposals. Our results show that our keyword-based approach for fragment detection and extraction provides us with cacheable fragments that, when combined with our proposed mapping table augmentation, can provide significant advantages for fragment-based Web caching of existing dynamic Web content.", "authors": ["Daniel Brodie", "Amrish Gupta", "Weisong Shi"], "n_citation": 20, "references": ["01c72fcc-8ea4-47ec-aa6e-c881de64750d", "04dfde75-7238-4265-b64d-a3d1dbf19dc2", "2ee3094d-6968-450e-8431-4fdb10848e7b", "31d84218-7118-4196-99d9-3072b79661b7", "324e1f9e-38e1-40cd-9ab9-2bdd4136d20d", "44da6ca4-1491-41a6-a8a4-b0f1e4db0188", "4f0b9e72-eaf6-408b-996c-35d60d6b2ad4", "5b38a2ae-04a1-4096-99f6-b900ccbad93a", "694993a7-da6d-4b37-8742-1341a25f8974", "6b64058c-5de2-4050-86a9-32518b3e8259", "6ef3c196-4de3-4372-934b-9fc5973a6555", "7004b6a7-0458-4c3c-86a6-503b482fca29", "71e52989-0f6b-4cfb-8d72-03c3fd8d2314", "79e7a54c-eee2-40e3-b5c6-a5f006c9facc", "7e14d870-1a57-4a96-b115-13a596053a25", "7e3d1a4c-d367-4692-b61e-31a721c10fde", "8b9cff7a-34fc-4129-bfd6-d6b4db19ac6a", "8d073d97-9e5f-4443-9138-0f3dd92336f7", "946cb26d-542c-4331-8d1b-a6c7399de655", "c3ad1b85-2a97-4790-b5c6-2f68c86e47c9", "c42cf770-1465-4e9c-b118-13c62640141c", "c4ef777e-3893-475a-bcf5-634528d2e6ab", "c5a4bbf3-34be-4486-a4d0-dc172743104e", "c940e462-1199-4bab-89d4-df0bab6ba45d", "ca498e1b-5b65-489e-b21b-79e1df5b310e", "cd8a4b59-48dc-4194-a484-b92e870b2e4c", "ead36483-f281-4125-91da-e2623009c4c6"], "title": "Accelerating dynamic web content delivery using keyword-based fragment detection", "venue": "international conference on web engineering", "year": 2005, "id": "46c66dce-ba91-47db-8e8b-f83c42b2c848"}

{"abstract": "Mobile computing poses a series of unique challenges for user interface design and development: user interfaces must now accommodate the capabilities of various access devices and be suitable for different contexts of use, while preserving consistency and usability. We propose a set of techniques that will aid UI designers who are working in the domain of mobile computing. These techniques will allow designers to build UIs across several platforms, while respecting the unique constraints posed by each platform. In addition, these techniques will help designers to recognize and accommodate the unique contexts in which mobile computing occurs. Central to our approach is the development of a user-interface model that serves to isolate those features that are common to the various contexts of use, and to specify how the user-interface should adjust when the context changes. We claim that without some abstract description of the UI, it is likely that the design and the development of user-interfaces for mobile computing will be very time consuming, error-prone or even doomed to failure.", "authors": ["Jacob Eisenstein", "Jean Vanderdonckt", "Angel R.

Furthermore, this preprocessing allowed the detection of neuronal source activations that were otherwise undetectable.

{"abstract": "We present ELEM2, a new method for inducing classification rules from a set of examples. The method employs several new strategies in the induction and classification processes to improve the predictive performance of induced rules. In particular, a new heuristic function for evaluating attribute-value pairs is proposed. The function is defined to reflect the degree of relevance of an attribute-value pair to a target concept and leads to selection of the most relevant pairs for formulating rules. Another feature of ELEM2 is that it handles inconsistent training data by defining an unlearnable region of a concept based on the probability distribution of that concept in the training data. To further deal with imperfect data, ELEM2 makes use of the post-pruning technique to remove unreliable portions of a generated rule. A new rule quality measure is proposed for the purpose of post-pruning. The measure is defined according to the relative distribution of a rule with respect to positive and negative examples. To show whether ELEM2 achieves its objective, we report experimental results which compare ELEM2 with C4.5 and CN2 on a number of datasets.", "authors": ["Aijun An", "Nick Cercone"], "n_citation": 57, "references": ["1d234fea-83f1-4eb0-b275-846d140e771b", "35d3987f-ff17-41cf-b928-ad66fb417c9f", "3682001b-e58b-47f4-8c69-e9894767972f", "42bd4971-02a1-4755-b685-6d350b378e98", "4fe3d9ff-4ae4-4728-80d4-1d04d76a22f4", "62549bc2-e0b3-46e8-8d32-390dded105d5", "86dafb65-1d2e-42d9-8982-4d520b6da774", "b3720ff1-fb33-43b8-b38f-8fee3c7dea77", "ec475544-43d3-410e-a181-a196d0f569f1", "f291765d-169d-49de-8972-a0c9692159f7"], "title": "ELEM2: A Learning System for More Accurate Classifications", "venue": "canadian conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 1998, "id": "71a6b38b-964f-4bac-bf53-e283e2d89050"}

{"abstract": "The purpose of this research is to generate natural motion of the biped locomotion robot such as the walking of a human in various environments. In this paper, we propose a method of stable motion generation of a biped locomotion robot. We apply the control of this proposed method with eight force sensors at the soles of the biped locomotion robot. The zero moment point (ZMP) is a well known index of stability in walking robots. ZMP is determined by the configuration of the robots. However, there are many configurations against the ZMP. Because of that, when we use ZMP as the stabilization index, we must select the best configuration in many stability configurations. Then it is a problem of which configurations are selected. In this paper, we solve the problem with recurrent neural networks. In both the single support and double support periods, we calculate the position of ZMP by using values from four force sensors at each sole, and actuation joints and the angles can be determined by recurrent neural networks without ZMP moving out from the supporting area of sole. We employ the recurrent neural networks with genetic algorithms for learning capability and self-adaptive mutation operator.

{"abstract": "In this paper, a new method for state estimation, referred to as the smooth variable structure filter (SVSF), is presented. The SVSF method is model based and applies to smooth nonlinear dynamic systems. It allows for the explicit definition of the source of uncertainty and can guarantee stability given an upper bound for uncertainties and noise levels. The performance of the SVSF improves with more refined definition of upper bounds on parameter variations or uncertainties. Furthermore, most filtering methods provide as their measure of performance the filter innovation vector or (output) estimation error. However in addition to the innovation vector, the SVSF has a secondary set of performance indicators that correlate to the modeling errors specific to each state or parameter that is being estimated. The combined robustness and multiple indicators of performance allow for dynamic refinement of internal models in the SVSF. Dynamic refinement and robustness are features that are particularly advantageous in fault diagnosis and prediction. In this paper, the applications of the SVSF to linear and nonlinear systems, including one pertaining to fault detection, are provided. The characteristics of this filter in terms of its accuracy and rate of convergence are discussed.", "authors": ["Saeid Habibi"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["063b5494-3d7c-47ac-b246-22966c061824", "27c2ea58-54d8-4c56-84e4-6a375393438b", "28528562-43b3-4d18-9d40-05e45bb69c52", "4104a834-c8a6-44b6-9f79-8c4553612815", "4a0d4e97-64a3-4f15-b968-1d5309ea83df", "4bff5ffd-5408-4aa0-b7c3-1851232a1db0", "581949bb-0499-4250-834d-68687e13e726", "d2324885-5296-438f-b9b2-b482232a212f", "e5a4909c-104a-4ca9-91c8-96a8e59d62aa", "fef8c2d1-e379-4e61-a336-5e8a786551e8"], "title": "The Smooth Variable Structure Filter", "venue": "Proceedings of the IEEE", "year": 2007, "id": "d3d38f06-8744-424c-9f54-12f435a7d403"}

The sampling procedure is described, in which queries obtained from each library were broadly categorised by image content, identification and accessibility. Attention is focused on the image content requests, for which a categorisation based on facet analysis is developed. The analytical tool which is used for this purpose is based on a schema already well established for the analysis of levels of meaning in images. The project demonstrates the possibility of formulating a general categorisation of requests which seek widely different still and moving image material.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we introduce a new algorithm for feature selection for two-class classification problems, called l 1 -StaR. The algorithm consists of first extracting the statistically relevant features using the Student t-test, and then passing the reduced feature set to an l 1 -norm support vector machine (SVM) with recursive feature elimination (RFE). The final number of features chosen by the l 1 -StaR algorithm can be smaller than the number of samples, unlike with l 1 -norm regression where the final number of features is bounded below by the number of samples. The algorithm is illustrated by applying it to the problem of determining which endometrial cancer patients are at risk of having the cancer spreading to their lymph nodes. The data consisted of 1,428 micro-RNAs measured on a data set of 94 patient samples (divided evenly between those with lymph node metastasis and those without). Using the algorithm, we identified a subset of just 15 micro-RNAs and a linear classifier based on these, that achieved two-fold cross validation accuracies in excess of 80%, and combined accuracy, sensitivity and specificity in excess of 93%.", "authors": ["M.

{"abstract": "Human Papillomavirus (HPV) infection is known as the main factor for cervical cancer, where cervical cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths in women worldwide. Because there are more than 100 types in HPV, it is critical to discriminate the HPVs related with cervi- cal cancer from those not related with it. In this paper, we classify the risk type of HPVs using their textual explanation. The important issue in this problem is to distinguish false negatives from false positives. That is, we must find out high-risk HPVs though we may miss some low-risk HPVs. For this purpose, the AdaCost, a cost-sensitive learner is adopted to consider different costs between training examples. The experimen- tal results on the HPV sequence database show that considering costs gives higher performance. The F-score is higher than the accuracy, which implies that most high-risk HPVs are found.", "authors": ["Seong-Bae Park", "Sohyun Hwang", "Byoung-Tak Zhang"], "n_citation": 16, "references": ["4564dd59-3ed0-4987-9dd9-3e30d2dcdb28", "4bf13cbb-9026-4e4a-90da-64104415c0b3", "859fbd62-0723-4ca9-b68f-9ac05a63307c", "c6c6c335-5f34-4439-9ab9-5b8913f58586", "fb5fd524-e3c0-4ae1-9767-915e943a0aa0", "fe4a0e82-e0ed-4c53-a2ee-ad80c6aec025"], "title": "Mining the Risk Types of Human Papillomavirus (HPV) by AdaCost", "venue": "database and expert systems applications", "year": 2003, "id": "7c4f9ddd-cbe8-4ff3-af27-5c2e1bd2188d"}
{"abstract": "All astronomy data and literature will soon be online and accessible via the Internet. The community is building the Virtual Observatory, an organization of this worldwide data into a coherent whole that can be accessed by anyone, in any form, from anywhere. The resulting system will dramatically improve our ability to do multi-spectral and temporal studies that integrate data from multiple instruments. The Virtual Observatory data also provide a wonderful base for teaching astronomy, scientific discovery, and computational science.#N##N#Many fields are now coping with a rapidly mounting problem: how to organize, use, and make sense of the enormous amounts of data generated by today's instruments and experiments. The data should be accessible to scientists and educators so that the gap between cutting-edge research and education and public knowledge is minimized and should be presented in a form that will facilitate integrative research. This problem is becoming particularly acute in many fields, notably genomics, neuroscience, and astrophysics. The availability of the Internet is allowing new ideas and concepts for data sharing and use. Here we describe a plan to develop an Internet data resource in astronomy to help address this problem in which, because of the nature of the data and analyses required of them, the data remain widely distributed rather than gathered in one or a few databases (e.g., GenBank). This approach may be applicable to many other fields. Our goal is to make the Internet act as the world's best telescope\u2014a World-Wide Telescope.#N##N#Today, there are many impressive archives painstakingly constructed from observations associated with an instrument. The Hubble Space Telescope (HST) (1), the Chandra X-Ray Observatory (2), the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) (3), the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) (4), and the Digitized Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (DPOSS) (5) are examples of this. Each of these archives is interesting in itself, but temporal and multi-spectral studies require combining data from multiple instruments. Furthermore, yearly advances in electronics bring new instruments, doubling the amount of data we collect each year ([Fig. 1][1]). For example, approximately a gigapixel is deployed on all telescopes today, and new gigapixel instruments are under construction. A night's observation requires a few hundred gigabytes of memory. The processed data for a single spectral band over the whole sky, a few terabytes. It is impossible for each astronomer to have a private copy of all the data they use. Many of these new instruments are being used for systematic surveys of our galaxy and of the distant universe. Together they will give us an unprecedented catalog to study the evolving universe, provided that the data can be systematically studied in an integrated fashion.#N##N#Online archives already contain raw and derived astronomical observations of billions of objects from both temporal and multi-spectral surveys. Together, they house an order of magnitude more data than any single instrument. In addition, all the astronomy literature is online and is cross-indexed with the observations (6, 7).#N##N#Why is it necessary to study the sky in such detail? Celestial objects radiate energy over an extremely wide range of wavelengths from radio waves to infrared, optical to ultraviolet, x-rays and even gamma rays. Each of these observations carries important information about the nature of the objects. The same physical object can appear to be totally different in different wavebands ([Fig. 2][2]). A young spiral galaxy appears as many concentrated \u201cblobs,\u201d the so-called HII regions in the ultraviolet, whereas in the optical it appears as smooth spiral arms. A galaxy cluster can only be seen as an aggregation of galaxies in the optical, whereas x-ray observations show the hot and diffuse gas between the galaxies.#N##N#The physical processes inside these objects can only be understood by combining observations at several wavelengths. Today, we already have large sky coverage in 10 spectral regions; soon we will have additional data in at least five more bands. These will reside in different archives, making their integration all the more complicated.#N##N#Raw astronomy data is complex. It can be in the form of fluxes measured in finite size pixels on the sky, spectra (flux as a function of wavelength), individual photon events, or even phase information from the interference of radio waves.#N##N#In many other disciplines, once data is collected, it can be frozen and distributed to other locations. This is not the case for astronomy. Astronomy data needs to be calibrated for the transmission of the atmosphere and for the response of the instruments. This requires an exquisite understanding of all the properties of the whole system, which sometimes takes several years. With each new understanding of how corrections should be made, the data are reprocessed and recalibrated. As a result, data in astronomy stays \u201clive\u201d much longer than in other disciplines\u2014it needs an active \u201ccuration,\u201d mostly by the expert group that collected the data.#N##N#Consequently, astronomy data reside at many different geographical locations, and that will not change. There will not be a central \u201cAstronomy database.\u201d Each group has its own historical reasons to archive the data one way or another. Any solution that tries to federate the astronomy data sets must start with the premise that this trend is not going to change substantially in the near future; there is no top-down way to simultaneously rebuild all data sources.#N##N#To solve these problems, the astrophysical community is developing the World-Wide Telescope, often called the \u201cVirtual Observatory\u201d (8). In this approach, the data will primarily be accessed via digital archives that are widely distributed. The actual telescopes will either be dedicated to surveys that feed the archives, or telescopes will be scheduled to follow up on \u201cinteresting\u201d phenomena found in the archives. Astronomers will look for patterns in the data\u2014spectral and temporal, known and unknown\u2014and use these to study various object classes. They will have a variety of tools at their fingertips: a unified search engine, to collect and aggregate data from several large archives simultaneously, and a huge distributed computing resource, to perform the analyses close to the data, in order to avoid moving petabytes of data across the networks.#N##N#Other sciences have comparable efforts of putting all their data online and in the public domain\u2014GenBank in genomics is a good example\u2014but so far these are centralized rather than federated systems.#N##N#The Virtual Observatory will give everyone access to data that span the entire spectrum, the entire sky, all historical observations, and all the literature. For publications, data will reside at a few sites maintained by the publishers. These archive sites will support simple searches. More complex analyses will be done with imported data extracts at the user's facility.#N##N#Time on the instrument will be available to all. Thus, the Virtual Observatory should make it easy to conduct such temporal and multi-spectral studies by automating the discovery and the assembly of the necessary data.#N##N#One of the main uses of the Virtual Observatory will be to facilitate searches where statistics are critical. We need large samples of galaxies in order to understand the fine details of the expanding universe and of galaxy formation. These statistical studies require multicolor imaging of millions of galaxies and measurement of their distances. We need to perform statistical analyses as a function of their observed type, environment, and distance.#N##N#Other projects study rare objects, ones that do not fit typical patterns; they search for the needles in the haystack. To this end, the use of multi-spectral observations is an enormous help. Colors of objects reflect their temperature. And in the expanding Universe, the light emitted by distant objects is redshifted. Therefore, searching for extremely red objects finds either extremely cold objects or extremely distant ones. Data mining studies of extremely red objects discovered distant quasars, the latest at a redshift of 6.28 (9). Mining the 2MASS and SDSS archives found many cold objects such as brown dwarfs, which are bigger than a planet yet smaller than a star. These are good examples of multiwavelength searches not possible with a single observation of the sky, done by hand today, automated in the future. We do not even know all of the data that existed; we will have to discover them on the fly.#N##N# [1]: #F1#N# [2]: #F2", "authors": ["Alexander S.

{"abstract": "A normalized gaussian network (NGnet) (Moody & Darken, 1989) is a network of local linear regression units. The model softly partitions the input space by normalized gaussian functions, and each local unit linearly approximates the output within the partition. In this article, we propose a new on-line EM algorithm for the NGnet, which is derived from the batch EM algorithm (Xu, Jordan, & Hinton 1995), by introducing a discount factor. We show that the on-line EM algorithm is equivalent to the batch EM algorithm if a specific scheduling of the discount factor is employed. In addition, we show that the on-line EM algorithm can be considered as a stochastic approximation method to find the maximum likelihood estimator. A new regularization method is proposed in order to deal with a singular input distribution. In order to manage dynamic environments, where the input-output distribution of data changes over time, unit manipulation mechanisms such as unit production, unit deletion, and unit division are also introduced based on probabilistic interpretation. Experimental results show that our approach is suitable for function approximation problems in dynamic environments.

{"abstract": "In principle, the version space approach can be applied to any induction problem. However, in some cases the representation language for generalizations is so powerful that (1) some of the update functions for the version space are not effectively computable, and (2) the version space contains infinitely many generalizations. The class of context-free grammars is a simple representation that exhibits these problems. This paper presents an algorithm that solves both problems for this domain. Given a sequence of strings, the algorithm incrementally constructs a data structure that has nearly all the beneficial properties of a version space. The algorithm is fast enough to solve small induction problems completely, and it serves as a framework for biases that permit the solution of larger problems heuristically.

We show that such ontology can be constructed by a decision tree algorithm and demonstrate the proposed method on the data set containing sunspot extracted from satellite images of solar disk.", "authors": ["Sinh Hoa Nguyen", "Trung Thanh Nguyen", "Hung Son Nguyen"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["00746968-1e3a-4043-abbd-3007d9135880", "1d107815-f0b2-470f-88e7-c1e245addecd", "31c99ded-7cc0-4dca-8d47-1a29928cd465", "38135245-8eff-4078-af6a-ea559ffa660b", "b49c1e2b-0cd0-4950-a724-00c698e5b49d"], "title": "Rough set approach to sunspot classification problem", "venue": "granular computing", "year": 2005, "id": "10f98864-0cef-4c46-9f38-66368de7aff3"}

{"abstract": "A constructive algorithm for designing an observer for a class of nonlinear systems is presented. We follow the invariant manifold based approach which allows to shape the dynamics of the estimation error. However, this shaping relies on the solution of a PDE which becomes difficult for multi-output systems. In this paper we remove this restriction by adding to the reduced-order observer an output filter and a single dynamic scaling parameter. We show that this method can be applied to systems with unknown parameters, leading to a new class of adaptive controllers.

{"abstract": "Beginning with a bounded (safe), live, or reversible Petri net as a first-level net model for a system, Petri nets are synthesized by first refining operation places through basic design modules in top-down modular ways, then adding nonshared resource places stepwise, and finally adding shared resource places step by step in a bottom-up manner. Refinement theory is extended to include reversibility of Petri nets. Parallel and sequential mutual exclusions are used to model shared resources. Design of the first-level Petri nets is discussed, and two basic kinds of Petri nets, choice-free and choice-synchronization, are given to cope with different types of manufacturing systems. The major advantages of the method are that the modeling details can be introduced in incremental ways such that complexity can be handled, and the important properties of the resulting Petri net are guaranteed so that costly mathematical analysis for boundedness, liveness, and reversibility can be avoided. A manufacturing system consisting of four machines, one assembly cell, two shared robots, and two buffers is used to illustrate the design methodology. >", "authors": ["MengChu Zhou", "Frank DiCesare", "Alan A.

{"abstract": "Conventional methods for state space exploration are limited to the analysis of small systems because they suffer from excessive memory and computational requirements. We have developed a new dynamic probabilistic state exploration algorithm which addresses this problem for general, structurally unrestricted state spaces. Our method has a low state omission probability and low memory usage that is independent of the length of the state vector. In addition, the algorithm can be easily parallelised. This combination of probability and parallelism enables us to rapidly explore state spaces that are an order of magnitude larger than those obtainable using conventional exhaustive techniques. We derive a performance model of this new algorithm in order to quantify its benefits in terms of distributed run-time, speedup and efficiency. We implement our technique on a distributed-memory parallel computer and demonstrate results which compare favourably with the performance model. Finally, we discuss suitable choices for the three hash functions upon which our algorithm is based. \u00a92000 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.", "authors": ["William J.

This paper proposes a hybrid approach of the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) and the gradient decent method for optimizing Bayesian classifiers under the SOFT target based Max-Min posterior Pseudo-probabilities (Soft-MMP) learning framework. In our hybrid optimization approach, the weighted mean of the parent population in the CMA-ES is adjusted by exploiting the gradient information of objective function, based on which the offspring is generated. As a result, the efficiency and the effectiveness of the CMA-ES are improved. We apply the Soft-MMP with the proposed hybrid optimization approach to handwritten digit recognition.

{"abstract": "Security of quantization index modulation (QIM) watermarking methods is usually sought through a pseudorandom dither signal which randomizes the codebook. This dither plays the role of the secret key (i.e., a parameter only shared by the watermarking embedder and decoder), which prevents unauthorized embedding and/or decoding. However, if the same dither signal is reused, the observation of several watermarked signals can provide sufficient information for an attacker to estimate the dither signal. This paper focuses on the cases when the embedded messages are either known or constant. In the first part of this paper, a theoretical security analysis of QIM data hiding measures the information leakage about the secret dither as the mutual information between the dither and the watermarked signals. In the second part, we show how set-membership estimation techniques successfully provide accurate estimates of the dither from observed watermarked signals. The conclusion of this twofold study is that current QIM watermarking schemes have a relative low security level against this scenario because a small number of observed watermarked signals yields a sufficiently accurate estimate of the secret dither.

{"abstract": "A new method for H-infinity gain-scheduled controller design by convex optimization is proposed that uses only frequency-domain data. The method is based on loop shaping in the Nyquist diagram with constraints on the weighted infinity-norm of closed-loop transfer functions. This method is applied to a benchmark for adaptive rejection of multiple narrow-band disturbances. First, it is shown that a robust controller can be designed for the rejection of a sinusoidal disturbance with known frequency. The disturbance model is fixed in the controller, based on the internal model principle, and the other controller parameters are computed by convex optimization to meet the constraints on the infinity-norm of sensitivity functions.

{"abstract": "Intentional insider misuse of information systems resources (i.e., IS misuse) represents a significant threat to organizations. For example, industry statistics suggest that between 50%--75% of security incidents originate from within an organization. Because of the large number of misuse incidents, it has become important to understand how to reduce such behavior. General deterrence theory suggests that certain controls can serve as deterrent mechanisms by increasing the perceived threat of punishment for IS misuse. This paper presents an extended deterrence theory model that combines work from criminology, social psychology, and information systems. The model posits that user awareness of security countermeasures directly influences the perceived certainty and severity of organizational sanctions associated with IS misuse, which leads to reduced IS misuse intention. The model is then tested on 269 computer users from eight different companies. The results suggest that three practices deter IS misuse: user awareness of security policies; security education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs; and computer monitoring. The results also suggest that perceived severity of sanctions is more effective in reducing IS misuse than certainty of sanctions. Further, there is evidence that the impact of sanction perceptions vary based on one's level of morality.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we introduce and investigate a \"new\" path optimization problem that we denote the  all hops optimal path  (AHOP) problem. The problem involves identifying, for all hop counts, the optimal, i.e., minimum weight, path(s) between a given source and destination(s). The AHOP problem arises naturally in the context of quality-of-service (QoS) routing in networks, where routes (paths) need to be computed that provide services guarantees, e.g., delay or bandwidth, at the minimum possible \"cost\" (amount of resources required) to the network. Because service guarantees are typically provided through some form of resource allocation on the path (links) computed for a new request, the hop count, which captures the  number  of links over which resources are allocated, is a commonly used cost measure. As a result, a standard approach for determining the cheapest path available that meets a desired level of service guarantees is to compute a minimum hop shortest (optimal) path. Furthermore, for efficiency purposes, it is desirable to  precompute  such optimal minimum hop paths for all possible service requests. Providing this information gives rise to solving the AHOP problem. The paper's contributions are to investigate the computational complexity of solving the AHOP problem for two of the most prevalent cost functions (path weights) in networks, namely, additive and bottleneck weights. In particular, we establish that a solution based on the Bellman-Ford algorithm is optimal for additive weights, but show that this does not hold for bottleneck weights for which a lower complexity solution exists.", "authors": ["Roch Gu\u00e9rin", "Ariel Orda"], "n_citation": 125, "references": ["04534795-09a5-4161-81a5-a84e9e84da8c", "33810e4f-271d-42d5-ab07-67ef307f3961", "738378be-3756-448d-8300-b91cdf91ecd7", "7966b1a7-c08a-4af7-9f00-0d4eee274215", "7f697fce-17c7-4fc4-baa2-0a67f847339b", "b9216abb-0932-4a38-97f4-9b910b699263", "c8040763-7a4d-45fc-93d2-fecdb7064a77", "d99fc710-137e-4503-9d55-9b1a51b5cece", "dfea79c1-ee77-4183-af70-2fea6492b15a", "f9fa7b35-2645-4fe2-a6ac-d59c59bf432a"], "title": "Computing shortest paths for any number of hops", "venue": "IEEE\\/ACM Transactions on Networking", "year": 2002, "id": "579b309d-506d-42c2-84b1-64cf052d3573"}

{"abstract": "Conversations involving three or more agents often occur in multi-agent systems, for example in brokering and auctions. For developing agents in open systems, it is important that the interactions in such conversations have a precise and unambiguous meaning. We address this issue by generalising a protocol-based semantic framework for expressing the semantics of Agent Communication Languages. The generalisations involve exploiting mechanistic aspects of the interaction (conversation identifiers), greater flexibility in the space of possible replies, and a richer representation of protocol states. We define intentional specifications for some brokerage and auction protocols, including event-based clocks to determine the ordering of events.

It is much harder to identify whether and how a large number of such ranked project factors influence project success, and to prioritize their influence on project success. At the same time, it is desirable to use the knowledge of project personnel effectively. Given a prioritization of project goals, it is shown how some key project characteristics can be related to project success. The method is applied in a case study consisting of 46 projects. For each project, six success factors and 27 project attributes were measured. Successful projects show common characteristics. Using this knowledge can lead to better control and software project management and to an increased likelihood of project success.", "authors": ["Claes Wohlin", "Anneliese Amschler Andrews"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0d9a1da3-96ae-432d-b114-71fc0d9a069c", "3c4b614f-3b85-41f1-8ae7-195e4fbd966a", "56e6b3fc-9e1c-48ff-a353-0b743149b4fa", "5b165419-6843-4c59-a43f-6fb52f50de8b", "70f089ea-a1c6-4564-bfbf-27f75b5876c4", "73992d60-fec1-4b79-a6af-68b709982156", "85075c55-962c-43e7-8412-4d93b20cbfb3", "85a15170-722c-4890-8432-d9061dc91348", "8d3d2fbb-64a3-49bb-96b2-fd349669457f", "9bfa77ad-8cce-4579-8c8b-8aa0160de5af", "d55398cf-2a71-4b19-a9a3-05c2d6c4bdfa", "d79aa40a-4f9b-4966-9643-f089a54f9188", "d93b64a3-754e-4bd5-9a09-5859cdd3bb3d", "ecbbe8a4-2ee1-4942-9b0f-fd8988fe6036"], "title": "Prioritizing and Assessing Software Project Success Factors and Project Characteristics using Subjective Data", "venue": "Empirical Software Engineering", "year": 2003, "id": "e6ec5437-e242-4d2d-a4db-f51fde8913d9"}

Rules specify, in the usual way, the objects which are consumed and the ones which are produced; in addition, they can specify the positions of the produced objects. Objects belong to two different sets: the set of ordinary objects and the set of mutually exclusive objects. Every position inside a membrane can accommodate an arbitrary number of ordinary objects, but at most one mutually exclusive object.

{"abstract": "Multihop wireless mesh networks (WMNs) are finding ever-growing acceptance as a viable and effective solution to ubiquitous broadband Internet access. This paper addresses the security of WMNs, which is a key impediment to wide-scale deployment of WMNs, but thus far receives little attention. We first thoroughly identify the unique security requirements of WMNs for the first time in the literature. We then propose ARSA, an attack-resilient security architecture for WMNs. In contrast to a conventional cellular-like solution, ARSA eliminates the need for establishing bilateral roaming agreements and having real-time interactions between potentially numerous WMN operators. With ARSA in place, each user is no longer bound to any specific network operator, as he or she ought to do in current cellular networks. Instead, he or she acquires a universal pass from a third-party broker whereby to realize seamless roaming across WMN domains administrated by different operators. ARSA supports efficient mutual authentication and key agreement both between a user and a serving WMN domain and between users served by the same WMN domain. In addition, ARSA is designed to be resilient to a wide range of attacks. We also discuss other important issues such as incontestable billing", "authors": ["Yanchao Zhang", "Yuguang Fang"], "n_citation": 192, "references": ["001cc9c9-ef79-49f2-9845-4b4cda2d57f3", "23df1f0d-7247-42a9-a3e2-73341df94fb2", "323e9838-3ab5-4033-8f58-66aaa87dc4fa", "39baf494-210f-4dbf-a438-279ea2b13e81", "448f7f9b-f8d0-4607-a317-598e12ae6331", "666e1ca7-8c79-43b1-8b57-6c5714301481", "6ad1cf29-4770-4689-8e68-7e5cfd51d6ee", "79031fa4-460c-4cea-964c-002d34f2e808", "7c9bbadf-2d1e-4aa7-98b5-001480d268d3", "8cc9ea80-563f-4e62-bda9-8ff6d71cf6ae", "b10fd24d-6a42-4821-9517-da6d1e14b17b", "b68fc787-7817-421e-8e66-8a98ab9db1ad", "b857298c-92c9-4f05-a704-3b9fc6be06e3", "c21d8c4f-dc64-4d21-bf39-74bfca650b86", "ccc96384-6f47-49ab-8694-5b0240c32c26", "f108f655-515f-49f8-853b-e01c9d492831", "f548a20c-d44b-4224-bbd5-c784312e4a55"], "title": "ARSA: An Attack-Resilient Security Architecture for Multihop Wireless Mesh Networks", "venue": "IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications", "year": 2006, "id": "9208a7e8-ff80-4462-ba30-6bd49aa01e7f"}

Our translator represents a novel synthesis of techniques including user-parameterized specification of primitive types and operators; removal of polymorphism by code specialization; removal of higher-order functions using closure datatypes and interpretation; and aggressive optimization of the resulting first-order code, which can be viewed as encoding the result of a closure analysis. Programs remain fully typed at every stage of the translation process, using only simple, standard type systems.

We show how a general approach to hybrid algorithms yields performance across the entire range of vector lengths. Moreover, many scalable implementations of application libraries require collective communication within groups of nodes.

However, the results in that work relied on recurrent-neural-network-specific objective functions, which are difficult to integrate with existing large vocabulary speech recognition systems. This paper investigates the use of DBLSTM as an acoustic model in a standard neural network-HMM hybrid system. We find that a DBLSTM-HMM hybrid gives equally good results on TIMIT as the previous work. It also outperforms both GMM and deep network benchmarks on a subset of the Wall Street Journal corpus. However the improvement in word error rate over the deep network is modest, despite a great increase in framelevel accuracy. We conclude that the hybrid approach with DBLSTM appears to be well suited for tasks where acoustic modelling predominates.

{"abstract": "Distributed weighted fair scheduling schemes for Quality of Service (QoS) support in wireless local area networks have not yet become standard. Therefore, we propose an Admission Control and Dynamic Bandwidth Management scheme that provides fairness and a soft rate guarantee in the absence of distributed MAC-layer weighted fair scheduling. This scheme is especially suitable for smart- rooms where peer-to-peer multimedia transmissions need to adapt their transmission rates co-operatively. We present a mapping scheme to translate the bandwidth requirements of an application into its channel time requirements. The center piece of our scheme is a Bandwidth Manager, which allots each flow a share of the channel, depending on the flow's requirements relative to the requirements of other flows in the network. Admitted flows control their transmission rates so they only occupy the channel for the fraction of time allotted to them. Thus co-operation between flows is achieved and the channel time is fair shared. As the available channel capacity changes and the traffic characteristics of various flows change, the Bandwidth Manager dynamically re-allocates the channel access time to the individual flows. Our simulation experiments show that, at a very low cost and with high probability, every admitted flow in the network will receive at least its minimum requested share of the network bandwidth. We also present extensive testbed experiments with our scheme using a real-time audio streaming application running between Linux laptops equipped with standard IEEE 802.11 network cards.", "authors": ["Samarth H.

{"abstract": "In this note, we consider the effect of information flow on the propagation of errors in spacing in a collection of vehicles trying to maintain a rigid formation during translational maneuvers. The motion of each vehicle is described using a linear time-invariant (LTI) system. We consider undirected and connected information flow graphs, and assume that each vehicle can communicate with a maximum of q vehicles, where q may vary with the size n of the collection. We consider translational maneuver of a reference vehicle, where its steady state velocity is different from its initial velocity. In the absence of any disturbing forces acting on the vehicles during the maneuver, it is desired that the collection be controlled in such a way that its motion asymptotically resembles that of a rigid body. In the presence of bounded disturbing forces acting on the vehicles, it is desired that the maximum deviation of the motion of the collection from that of a rigid body be bounded and be independent of the size of the collection. We consider a decentralized feedback control scheme, where the controller of each vehicle takes into account the aggregate errors in position and velocity from the vehicles with which it is in direct communication. We assume that all vehicles start at their respective desired positions and velocities. Since the displacement of every vehicle at the end of the maneuver of the reference vehicle must be the same, we show that the loop transfer function must have at least two poles at the origin. We then show that if the loop transfer function has three or more poles at the origin, then the motion of the collection is unstable, that is, its deviation from the rigid body motion is arbitrarily large, if the size of the formation is sufficiently large. If l is the number of poles of the transfer function relating the position of a vehicle with its control input, we show that if (q(n)/n)rarr0 as nrarrinfin, then there is a low frequency sinusoidal disturbance of at most unit amplitude acting on each vehicle such that the maximum errors in spacing response increase at least as Omega(((radicn/q(n)) l+1 )).A function p(n) is Omega(q(n)) if there exists a nonzero constant c>0 and a N *  such that |p(n)|gesc|q(n)| for all n>N *  . A consequence of the results presented in this note is that the maximum errors in spacing and velocity of any vehicle can be made insensitive to the size of the collection only if there is at least one vehicle in the collection that communicates with at least Omega(n) other vehicles in the collection", "authors": ["Sai Krishna Yadlapalli", "Swaroop Darbha", "K.

{"abstract": "Development of vehicle active steering collision avoidance systems calls for mathematical models capable of predicting a human driver's response so as to reduce the cost involved in field tests while accelerating product development. This paper provides a discussion on the paradigms that may be used for modeling a driver's steering interaction with vehicle collision avoidance control in path-following scenarios. Four paradigms, namely decentralized, noncooperative Nash, noncooperative Stackelberg, and cooperative Pareto are established. The decentralized paradigm, which is developed on the basis of optimal control theory, represents a driver's interaction with the collision avoidance controllers that disregard driver steering control. The noncooperative Nash and Stackelberg paradigms are used for predicting a driver's steering behavior in response to the collision avoidance control that actively compensates for driver steering action. These two are devised based on the principles of equilibria in noncooperative game theory. The cooperative Pareto paradigm is derived from cooperative game theory to model a driver's interaction with the collision avoidance systems that take into account the driver's target path. The driver and the collision avoidance controllers\u2019 optimization problems and their resulting steering strategies arise in each paradigm are delineated. Two mathematical approaches applicable to these optimization problems namely the distributed model predictive control and the linear quadratic dynamic optimization approaches are described in detail. A case study illustrating a conflict in steering control between driver and vehicle collision avoidance system is performed via simulation. It was found that the variation of driver path-error cost function weights results in a variety of steering behaviors, which are distinct between paradigms.", "authors": ["Xiaoxiang Na", "David J.

{"abstract": "In this paper, the trajectory tracking of a 2-D piezo-driven system (2DPDS) using microprocessor-based fuzzy decentralized control (MBFDC) is developed. It is known that the piezoelectric actuator contains hysteresis, which is not one-to-one mapping and memoryless nonlinearity. Due to this nonlinearity and the coupling characteristic of the 2DPDS, an effective decentralized control is difficult to design. From the very beginning, the suitable coefficients of switching surface are assigned to stabilize the dynamics of switching surface and to shape the response of tracking error. Based on the data of input/output, two scaling factors are employed to normalize the switching surface and its derivative. According to the concept of if-then rule, an appropriate rule table for the ith subsystem is then achieved. This table is skew symmetric about the diagonal line; the absolute value of this table is proportional to the distance to the diagonal line. According to the system stability, the output-scaling factor is determined. Finally, a sequence of experiments including the trajectory tracking using MBFDC, proportional-integral-differential control, and classic fuzzy control is carried out to confirm the usefulness of the proposed control system.", "authors": ["Chih-Lyang Hwang"], "n_citation": 15, "references": ["0646885f-c2c6-430e-8f54-d9bd6c260bfb", "21fb7c6c-5259-4108-a7bf-ccaeab862f34", "2f6a1e90-dcd2-4eb1-8197-d43a655c5e62", "30b04abf-9f75-4806-8f4f-50f206db9be6", "480dfdd4-747b-431f-982e-f4414d0e8955", "4be390b0-7e8c-47bc-9985-84761faeb3c8", "4d514c86-c96a-4de5-8d60-38ac90594faf", "4f39af30-9d3a-47cf-9c2e-0743bd3ba1bb", "709ed189-1fcb-410a-b0bd-3cbb3bacfab6", "764b0e63-079a-4074-9463-d0126592557d", "bd60b200-7f85-4870-ae28-7de43091db6d", "c04fee4f-34b9-40f5-8b6b-d893888884d8", "d82e5213-8385-4c22-abce-0a6afdc5da10", "e4dd99cc-38eb-4a22-a262-bb68afd19ae9"], "title": "Microprocessor-Based Fuzzy Decentralized Control of 2-D Piezo-Driven Systems", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics", "year": 2008, "id": "e6716477-cc93-4b89-b4c3-23fc6831ef86"}

{"abstract": "We present a logical language which extends the syntax of positive Horn clauses by permitting implications in goals and in the bodies of clauses. The operational meaning of a goal which is an implication is given by the deduction theorem: a goal D ae G is provable from a program P if the goal G is provable from the larger program P ( fDg. This paper explores the qualitative nature of this extension to logic programming. For example, if the formula D is the conjunction of universally quantified clauses, we interpret the goal D ae G as a request to load the code in D prior to attempting G and then unload that code after G succeeds or fails. This extended use of implication provides a logical explanation of parametric modules, some uses of Prolog's assert predicate, and aspects of abstract datatypes. Both a model theory and proof theory are presented for this logical language. In particular, we show how to build a Kripke-like model for programs by a fixed point construction and show that the operational meaning of implication mentioned above is sound and complete for intuitionistic logic. We also examine a weak notion of negation which is easily implemented in this language and show how database constraints can be represented by it.", "authors": ["Dale Miller"], "n_citation": 353, "references": ["4d996c8b-b144-410a-a8c5-97e6ec25b289", "5efdf9b2-a2e2-4929-9728-00fbca01e604", "62f4a31d-b3e1-4fe2-a458-23c4e624f69f", "88b59006-3e06-4205-a6aa-9b1214e3d2ea", "9f80a041-d5ed-4f55-8d58-888bea30cbb6", "a580df38-2df7-4b02-8dfa-edada924de45", "a8b275c1-415b-4367-80b2-c1a0a9f0c6a6", "c8c82b57-aa11-4bfd-9d38-a0f7269847f6", "e72bd182-fd43-41c6-8031-288fe17c90c4", "eafea9c0-c5bf-4c99-976a-578e7335eebc"], "title": "A logical analysis of modules in logic programming", "venue": "Journal of Logic Programming", "year": 1989, "id": "ac617709-0d4c-45e6-ae0a-d401f438a27b"}
{"abstract": "Researchers have developed a number of runtime verification tools that generate runtime monitors in the form of AspectJ aspects. In this work, we present CLARA, a novel framework to statically optimize such monitoring aspects with respect to a given program under test. CLARA uses a sequence of increasingly precise static analyses to automatically convert a monitoring aspect into a residual runtime monitor. The residual monitor only watches events triggered by program locations that the analyses failed to prove safe at compile time. In two-thirds of the cases in our experiments, the static analysis succeeds on all locations, proving that the program fulfills the stated properties, and completely obviating the need for runtime monitoring. In the remaining cases, the residual runtime monitor is usually much more efficient than a full monitor, yet still captures all property violations at runtime.", "authors": ["Eric Bodden", "Patrick Lam", "Laurie J.

In this paper we introduce the \"Fab\" adaptive web page recommendation service. There has been much research on analyzing document content in order to improve recommendations or search results.

The Fab system strikes a balance between these two approaches, taking advantage of the shared interests among users without losing the benefits of the representations provided by content analysis. Running since March 1996, it has been populated with a collection of agents for the collection and selection of web pages, whose interaction fosters emergent collaborative properties.

{"abstract": "This paper considers the economic dispatch problem for a group of generator units communicating over an arbitrary weight-balanced digraph. The objective of the individual units is to collectively generate power to satisfy a certain load while minimizing the total generation cost, which corresponds to the sum of individual arbitrary convex functions. We propose a class of distributed Laplacian-gradient dynamics that are guaranteed to asymptotically find the solution to the economic dispatch problem with and without generator constraints. The proposed coordination algorithms are anytime, meaning that its trajectories are feasible solutions at any time before convergence, and they become better solutions as time elapses. In addition, we design the provably correct  determine feasible allocation  strategy that handles generator initialization and the addition and deletion of units via a message passing routine over a spanning tree of the network.

The other part rejects bounded uncertainties throughout the entire response of the system. As a result, a higher order sliding mode is established. The advantages of the method are that its implementation is easy, the time convergence is chosen in advance and the robustness is ensured.

The use of the seismic signals in unattended ground sensor systems brings new challenges to the problem because of the complexity of the seismic waves and their highly dependency on the underlying geology. This paper proposes a new feature extraction algorithm - spectral statistics and wavelet coefficients characterization (SSWCC). SSWCC extracts a feature vector from both the frequency and the time-frequency domain analysis of the seismic signals, including the spectrum, the power spectral density (PSD) and the wavelet coefficients. The SSWCC algorithm is designed for real-time applications, and has shown its robustness and effectiveness through a series of experiments.

Both algorithms require a number of calls to the submodular function that is cubic to the number of vertices in the graph.

Simulations indicate that both the adaptive and nonadaptive versions of this operator are capable of producing solutions that are statistically as good as, or better, than those produced when using Gaussian or Cauchy mutations alone.", "authors": ["Kumar Chellapilla"], "n_citation": 249, "references": ["38126abb-8a4f-4a03-bc36-f7a9311f3660", "3dccb902-b214-493f-ae39-36e43c42fdb1", "5d506e8b-8cf8-4fd2-9ca6-239f407fd7b6", "6a9c469a-6e85-4492-8be8-65215fab8392", "c017f7e0-5ec8-45f7-bc81-e11d5f307a51", "c3f71889-8523-430b-bccf-1ec113228802"], "title": "Combining mutation operators in evolutionary programming", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation", "year": 1998, "id": "b4a2aa79-2516-43eb-9a6f-84b011f18dd4"}
{"abstract": "Background:  The main goal of the PROMISE repository is to enable reproducible, and thus verifiable or refutable research. Over time, plenty of data sets became available, especially for defect prediction problems.    Aims:  In this study, we investigate possible problems and pitfalls that occur during replication. This information can be used for future replication studies, and serve as a guideline for researchers reporting novel results.    Method:  We replicate two recent defect prediction studies comparing different data sets and learning algorithms, and report missing information and problems.    Results:  Even with access to the original data sets, replicating previous studies may not lead to the exact same results. The choice of evaluation procedures, performance measures and presentation has a large influence on the reproducibility. Additionally, we show that trivial and random models can be used to identify overly optimistic evaluation measures.    Conclusions:  The best way to conduct easily reproducible studies is to share all associated artifacts, e.g. scripts and programs used. When this is not an option, our results can be used to simplify the replication task for other researchers.", "authors": ["Thilo Mende"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["16681632-81f5-42df-9808-3cf4e24a375e", "1f02c39f-ea5f-445b-8c24-bb1662e4e59c", "2068a31e-93c4-497f-ad79-c0ca3bf88ab8", "21ffae8e-2406-4e5e-b1e1-e6a0f9a82bf1", "32496c5a-28fd-4b33-88c3-3501c2a88fe4", "6c3b836b-1fc7-4e16-85d7-16ee9aa34845", "842e96df-fb8b-43ba-8643-4b3714b44dbf", "8afc4f24-0abe-437f-977e-375ec3ec907d", "8d063832-6861-4e52-a930-c72ac67ed8fe", "a05b8bcf-789e-4538-8f43-86e6d7bb4285", "a2298c28-21d4-4bec-bf0f-01e586be093f", "a5536cff-4996-4757-816b-a2452b5052d0", "b24cfecf-f3db-4da4-8b58-66d821ed450e", "d2c0bb3b-27f9-4ba0-b5b3-d988a8ec8129", "d4cd2afd-272c-4189-8686-7cb50d6e012c", "d5a44f14-60d8-4dd8-98a2-f805830df6cd", "d5b745d0-d0b4-48fa-a20e-3249cb2e46dd", "d8bd219b-4e7c-4ba4-8c02-3c07b8457983", "da236a5b-d7a4-423c-a344-a5afe9b444a0", "e3654d9b-7694-4e79-9f63-8b8dd913ddbd", "f29e7bed-c879-4a1c-af49-7a5dea607292", "f9e273eb-e5c5-4722-8e6c-41c0caf9cf58"], "title": "Replication of defect prediction studies: problems, pitfalls and recommendations", "venue": "predictive models in software engineering", "year": 2010, "id": "466ddb08-5b74-4b2a-967d-2203c8526415"}

The method described uses the strategies of stacking and Correspondence Analysis to model the relationship between the learning examples and their classification by a collection of learned models.

CBIR relies on the representation (metadata) of images' visual content. In order to produce such metadata, we propose an efficient and adaptive clustering algorithm to segment the images into regions of high similarity. This approach contrasts with those that use a single color histogram for the whole image (global methods), or local color histograms for a fixed number of image cells (partition based methods). Our experimental results show that our clustering approach offers high retrieval effectiveness with low space overhead.

{"abstract": "Existing database management systems are tailored to traditional business applications. Since 1980, a variety of new database applications have arisen: VLSI CAD, graphics, and statistical databases are examples. These new applications cannot be handled easily or efficiently by available DBMSs because their requirements are so unusual. In particular, they demand special-purpose data types and operators, and require novel storage structures and new query processing techniques. The idea that a single DBMS can handle all database tasks equally well is no longer practical. Customized database systems are needed. Two approaches are currently taken to customize a DBMS. Either a system is built from scratch, or an existing system is modified. However, neither approach is cost effective as it takes many man-years of effort and hundreds of thousands of dollars to produce an operational system. Recently, a number of researchers have independently conceived the idea of extensible or reconfigurable DBMSs ([Car85], [Day85], [Sto86], [Bat86a]). These systems are modular, they are essentially software busses where modules with desired DBMS capabilities can be plugged or unplugged in a matter of hours or days at virtually no cost to produce a customized DBMS. The idea of extensible DBMSs is a powerful concept, and is certainly a more attractive approach to DBMS customization than current methods. Features that can be customized in DBMSs can be broadly categorized as being logical front-end or physical back-end. At the logical front-end of a DBMS, it should be possible to introduce new object types and new operators. For example, conventional relational DBMSs provide only integer, float, and string data types. Nontraditional applications require novel data types, such as polygons and time-series. It should be possible to support new abstraction concepts, such as molecular objects and versions which are useful in the context of VLSI CAD data ([Bat85a]). Also, it should be possible to express and process recursive queries and rules. At the physical back-end of a DBMS, it should be possible to admit new storage structures, new concurrency control and recovery algorithms, and new query optimization algorithms. These are just some of the more important examples. GENESIS is an extensible database management system that is being developed to address the needs of nontraditional applications. Our approach to developing GENESIS software is based on three principles. First, we are using theoretical models of logical and physical database organization to help identify the software atoms of database management systems. That is, we are taking a building blocks approach to DBMS construction: by composing different atoms (modules) in different ways, we can quickly construct different (i.e., customized) DBMSs. There are several important advantages to this approach. Software atoms (modules) can be written and debugged separately rather than the common approach to write and debug compositions of many atoms simultaneously. In this way, software development is simplified. Also, our approach provides the means for fast technology transfer. If a new file structure or database algorithm is invented, it is a matter of writing the software atom (module) that encodes this file structure or algorithm. The atom could then be used immediately in the construction of DBMSs. Second, all software atoms are plug compatible. That is, all modules that implement DBMS primitives have the same interface. This makes module composition trivial.Third, all software atoms are reusable. Many DBMSs use exactly the same software atoms, which means that many algorithms have been reinvented over and over again at an enormous cost. Our approach attempts to minimize technology reinvention by writing atoms once and reusing them.It turns out that the techniques that are needed to achieve logical database extensibility and physical database extensibility are rather different. We are using a functional data model and data language as the logical front-end to GENESIS ([Shi81], [Bun82]). The functional approach is well-suited for extensible database systems as it is open-ended: new object types and operators can be added easily. A description of the GENESIS data model and data language, the techniques that are being used for its implementation, and how the data language is being used to express and process queries on non1NF relational databases is given in [Bat86b].The physical back-end of GENESIS is based on the Unifying Model ([Bat82]) and Transformation Model ([Bat85b]). These models explain how complicated storage structures that are used in commercial database management systems are actually are combinations of primitive file structures, linkset structures, and conceptual-to-internal mappings. A description of the implementation of the physical back-end of GENESIS is given in [Bat86c].We are using object-based models as a means for unifying database research with techniques in software engineering.", "authors": ["Don S.

CLOUDS reduces computation and I/O complexity substantially compared to state of the art classifiers, while maintaining the quality of the generated trees in terms of accuracy and tree size. We provide experimental results with a number of real and synthetic datasets.", "authors": ["Khaled Alsabti", "Sanjay Ranka", "Vineet Singh"], "n_citation": 46, "references": ["06e17da3-977f-4508-8cb2-d9b4e8bd780f", "b4fcc119-4eb1-4094-b16a-1202968654be", "c0a9dcdb-908e-4027-9727-10e9d085d692"], "title": "CLOUDS: a decision tree classifier for large datasets", "venue": "knowledge discovery and data mining", "year": 1998, "id": "7d01ff2e-3a76-4c50-bfd4-59b9655df5f6"}
{"abstract": "Signature files have been studied extensively, as an access method for textual databases. Many approaches have been proposed for searching signatures files efficiently. However, different methods make different assumptions and use different performance measures, making it difficult to compare their performance. In this paper, we study three basic methods proposed in the literature, namely, the indexed descriptor file, the two-level superimposed coding scheme, and the partitioned signature file approach. The contribution of this paper is two-fold. First, we present a uniform analytical performance model so that the methods can be compared fairly and consistently. The analysis shows that the two-level superimposed coding scheme, if stored in a transposed file, has the best performance. Second, we extend the two-level superimposed coding method into a multilevel superimposed coding method, we obtain the optimal number of levels for the multilevel method and show that for databases with reasonable size the optimal value is much larger than 2, which is assumed in the two-level method. The accuracy of the analytical formula is demonstrated by simulation. >", "authors": ["Dik Lun Lee", "Young Man Kim", "Gaurav H.

{"abstract": "\"Crowdsourcing\" is commonly defined as the use of large groups of individuals by organizations to perform tasks traditionally performed by employees or designated agents. Currently, organizations are turning to the crowd to complete a wide variety of organization tasks. However, we know little about the types of tasks completed, the different crowds that participate, and the characteristics that manifest themselves in these initiatives. Preliminary findings from a grounded theory study designed to identify patterns and themes found in crowdsourced initiatives have revealed four common uses of the crowd (i.e., productivity, innovation, knowledge capture, and marketing/branding). Additionally, reoccurring themes related to the knowledge the crowd brings to the task, the location of the crowd, as well as organizational challenges and value capture have been identified.

{"abstract": "The energy consumed in cluster head (CH) selection phase of a random cluster based wireless sensor network (WSN) has been assumed as an insignificant factor in the previous research works. In this paper, the consumption of energy during the transmission of data from sensor nodes to the sink has been calculated. Through extensive simulations it has been shown that 20% of the network's total consumed energy is exhausted in the random CH selection phase only. This energy consumption can be taken as an overhead energy. To overcome the overhead energy, an energy efficient \u201cRound Rotation\u201d (RR) mechanism has been proposed. By implementing the RR mechanism with random CH selection phase, the over head energy has been reduced to 4% of the total network energy consumed in data transmissions. This has consequently affected the network lifetime which has been augmented by 20%.

{"abstract": "We study an approach to policy selection for large relational Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). We consider a variant of approximate policy iteration (API) that replaces the usual value-function learning step with a learning step in policy space. This is advantageous in domains where good policies are easier to represent and learn than the corresponding value functions, which is often the case for the relational MDPs we are interested in. In order to apply API to such problems, we introduce a relational policy language and corresponding learner. In addition, we introduce a new bootstrapping routine for goal-based planning domains, based on random walks. Such bootstrapping is necessary for many large relational MDPs, where reward is extremely sparse, as API is ineffective in such domains when initialized with an uninformed policy. Our experiments show that the resulting system is able to find good policies for a number of classical planning domains and their stochastic variants by solving them as extremely large relational MDPs. The experiments also point to some limitations of our approach, suggesting future work.", "authors": ["Alan Fern", "Sung Wook Yoon", "Robert Givan"], "n_citation": 123, "references": ["077f3cc9-120a-4530-acec-ff0f6f5c10a7", "1aae8dda-25f9-4d26-9d00-562605408512", "1ad309e3-593b-4712-b170-1e199c96ba5a", "23086e4e-f87d-4085-bfdb-1287371a309e", "243fea8e-0d0e-4a61-a5bf-2d7fc6576a8c", "2bf477e4-f0d0-440c-97c6-bc0fd562fc05", "40cb4325-6467-48fd-814a-915bf7ca3ac6", "41db5408-9101-4c9e-b8d7-7b00f964af79", "41de0c82-c218-4c6c-a326-df6ca6173f8b", "4810e15e-cc5d-487b-a5e6-285553d36900", "54b4534b-eab1-4f0e-af45-59278d475e94", "5f155e51-9d82-44f3-b177-36e5fe39346b", "68ea04b5-df82-4bc7-a1fb-1268072f4983", "6dfce037-5447-4103-b9b1-8056d210cfb3", "6f899b31-b5ca-462f-a1b7-4eba0eb6b1c1", "80b24bb6-6f30-45f0-be77-140c8331a243", "81264f1a-b023-4bb5-b58a-ff2eb48ea9a6", "82bbf74b-1531-414f-97fd-0296f1c13bd6", "86d8e019-888b-4b9b-b71f-1960cc2c3d00", "8abc1e16-a996-4217-b11c-d4b45a41e51a", "9195d34e-dd4c-44e1-8335-18b63a9dc6ca", "91cb2894-ad8e-4452-a16f-83dac640ce31", "97709fc2-ed01-48ac-8e12-2eda51170cec", "97da6295-ce00-472f-b401-0739a12920bb", "a1ecd103-431c-439b-a3b7-e81cd10ec2eb", "a254ece1-894d-487e-96bc-2c583ad06cea", "b3efaa9f-5fb5-4aee-83d5-2dc73cfa859f", "b504e063-3246-462d-abd2-e6ee1df440af", "b896a466-a32d-4439-9e5e-d6e1144a0cb9", "be7ce4d6-45fa-4bf4-9c44-957ff5718083", "beed901e-9930-4087-ad60-e00f7f08eec2", "c2c72fad-8cf0-4b4e-9d3e-660035f1b62a", "e9088243-4a3b-4cc2-921b-8275ebf764a7", "f4d800c0-b107-44de-be66-f7fb1aa98664", "f843a650-d219-431b-b914-b0d38da86e2c", "f9a89046-9d0b-4fea-b068-17c4fc2d0102"], "title": "Approximate policy iteration with a policy language bias: solving relational Markov decision processes", "venue": "Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research", "year": 2006, "id": "b853d2f2-9a3a-4113-8176-b359e480d522"}
{"abstract": "Analysis of dynamic data structure usage is useful for both program understanding and for improving the accuracy of other program analyses. Static analysis techniques, however, suffer from reduced accuracy in complex situations, and do not necessarily give a clear picture of runtime heap activity. We have designed and implemented a dynamic heap analysis system that allows one to examine and analyze how Java programs build and modify data structures. Using a complete execution trace from a profiled run of the program, we build an internal representation that mirrors the evolving runtime data structures. The resulting series of representations can then be analyzed and visualized, and we show how to use our approach to help understand how programs use data structures, the precise effect of garbage collection, and to establish limits on static data structure analysis.

{"abstract": "We study perpetual reductions in orthogonal (or conflict-free) fully extended expression reduction systems (OERS). ERS is a formalism for rewriting that subsumes term rewriting systems (TRSs) and the l-calculus. We design a strategy that, for any given term t in a fully extended OERS, constructs a longest reduction starting from t if t is strongly normalizing and otherwise constructs an infinite reduction. We call this strategy a limit strategy. For a large class of OERSs a limit strategy is computable. The Conservation Theorem for fully extended OERSs follows easily from the properties of the strategy. We develop a method for computing the lengths of longest developments in OERSs.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a novel scheme of scalable coding for encrypted images. In the encryption phase, the original pixel values are masked by a modulo-256 addition with pseudorandom numbers that are derived from a secret key. After decomposing the encrypted data into a downsampled subimage and several data sets with a multiple-resolution construction, an encoder quantizes the subimage and the Hadamard coefficients of each data set to reduce the data amount. Then, the data of quantized subimage and coefficients are regarded as a set of bitstreams. At the receiver side, while a subimage is decrypted to provide the rough information of the original content, the quantized coefficients can be used to reconstruct the detailed content with an iteratively updating procedure. Because of the hierarchical coding mechanism, the principal original content with higher resolution can be reconstructed when more bitstreams are received.", "authors": ["Xinpeng Zhang", "Guorui Feng", "Yanli Ren", "Zhenxing Qian"], "n_citation": 70, "references": ["1438edbd-e66c-4450-9119-c1cf14e0b9d6", "145209eb-7f4d-4fb9-9641-548637bce344", "27362a3f-c9a0-4b07-832a-d65999dcfa27", "2fb588af-31f7-4fcb-8395-80082c2f899c", "806c170b-77a4-4d80-a45e-886223eb3232", "8551beaa-422a-47d1-a791-62f196205b11", "9c558720-fff8-46db-8672-9e4b53b7c823", "9f84f26e-bb6f-429d-b48f-e19fa4360cc7", "ad279cdd-909d-4d81-8c56-5864744361b3", "afc3423c-481a-4ece-99c6-bb83a070151b", "b0c39882-77b1-4abc-b370-a3c2691d97a0", "ba4aec44-5f06-42e5-b136-a1382288b1a5", "e0041d30-6ce2-4547-8842-ea60a448ad6d", "e6eff34a-80a4-42c9-a63e-ca406fcea6af", "fe119ba4-0360-418f-9da6-1885d82b8a5f"], "title": "Scalable Coding of Encrypted Images", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "year": 2012, "id": "55786957-9758-4c93-9806-72de06442b1d"}
{"abstract": "Many machine learning algorithms require the input to be represented as a fixed-length feature vector. When it comes to texts, one of the most common fixed-length features is bag-of-words. Despite their popularity, bag-of-words features have two major weaknesses: they lose the ordering of the words and they also ignore semantics of the words. For example, \"powerful,\" \"strong\" and \"Paris\" are equally distant. In this paper, we propose Paragraph Vector, an unsupervised algorithm that learns fixed-length feature representations from variable-length pieces of texts, such as sentences, paragraphs, and documents. Our algorithm represents each document by a dense vector which is trained to predict words in the document. Its construction gives our algorithm the potential to overcome the weaknesses of bag-of-words models. Empirical results show that Paragraph Vectors outperforms bag-of-words models as well as other techniques for text representations. Finally, we achieve new state-of-the-art results on several text classification and sentiment analysis tasks.", "authors": ["Quoc V.

{"abstract": "Deductive verification aims to prove deep properties about programs. The classic Floyd-Hoare-style approach to verifying sequential programs reduces program validity queries to first-order validity queries via verification conditions. Proving that a program is totally correct requires proving the safety aspect with invariants and the progress aspect with invariants and ranking functions. Where do the invariants and ranking functions come from?#R##N##R##N#A verifying compiler that reads program annotations enables the programmer to write desired properties as assertions. Unfortunately, verifying a safety property requires strengthening it to an inductive assertion, while proving termination requires finding ranking functions. The strengthening process often involves writing many tedious facts, while ranking functions are not always intuitive. In practice, programmers do not want or are unable to invent inductive assertions and ranking functions. Instead, the ideal verifying compiler strengthens the given assertions with facts learned through static analysis. Invariant generators are a class of static analyzers that automatically synthesize inductive invariants. Ranking function generators automatically synthesize ranking functions, sometimes with supporting invariants. Together, they reduce the burden on the programmer by automatically learning facts about programs.#R##N##R##N#In this talk, we discuss our approach to invariant and ranking function generation. A constraint-based method labels program points with parameterized expressions, which encode the shape of the desired inductive assertions or ranking functions. For example, the shape of an inductive invariant could be an inequality between affine combinations of program variables, while the shape of a ranking function could be an affine combination of program variables. It then generates a set of parameterized verification conditions and solves for the parameter values that make them valid. Instantiating the parameterized expressions with these values results in a set of inductive assertions or ranking functions. We discuss recent work for analyzing termination of programs that manipulate variables via affine expressions. We also discuss a constraint-based analysis for programs with integer division and modulo operators. Finally, we present experimental evidence indicating that invariant and ranking function generation is a powerful technique for scaling deductive verification to large programs.", "authors": ["Aaron R.

The generated workflow code can be optimized by controlling the order in which the transformation rules are applied. We then present an implementation of the transformation method that directly manipulates an object-oriented model of the Business Process Execution Lan- guage for Web Services BPEL4WS. The implementation maps abstract contin- uation equations to the BPEL4WS control-flow graph. The transformation rules manipulate the links in the graph such that all cycles are removed and replaced by equivalent structured activities.

{"abstract": "This paper proposes a framework for detecting global state predicates in systems of processes with approximately-synchronized real-time clocks. Timestamps from these clocks are used to define two orderings on events: \"definitely occurred before\" and \"possibly occurred before\". These orderings lead naturally to definitions of 3 distinct detection modalities, i.e., 3 meanings of \"predicate \u03a6 held during a computation\", namely: Poss \u2192  db   \u03a6 (\"\u03a6 possibly held\"), Def \u2192  db   \u03a6 (\"\u03a6 definitely held\"), and Inst \u03a6 (\"\u03a6 definitely held in a specific global state\"). This paper defines these modalities and gives efficient algorithms for detecting them. The algorithms are based on algorithms of Garg and Waldecker, Alagar and Venkatesan, Cooper and Marzullo, and Fromentin and Raynal.

{"abstract": "The World Wide Web has evolved from a distributed hypertext system to a platform-independent graphical user interface that integrates many network services. So far, its technology has restricted it mainly to applications for information retrieval. As networks become ubiquitious and more and more users have a permanent connection, \u00abhere is an increasing demand for other network services, such as real-time data feeds, group communication, and teleconferencing. So far, these services have been provided by various proprietary software systems, which were hard to set up and use, and thus not very successful. Integrating real-time group communication services into the World Wide Web is a natural way to make them more accessible and will take the Web a step further on its way to becoming the universal network application. In this paper, we describe functionalities required for these services and present an implementation based on Sun Microsystem's Java  2  programming language. We focus on the high-level functionalities and abstractions, but also describe an object-oriented programming model for group communication systems.", "authors": ["Ulrich Gall", "Franz J.

{"abstract": "Performance, power, and temperature are now all first-order design constraints. Balancing power efficiency, thermal constraints, and performance requires some means to convey data about real-time power consumption and temperature to intelligent resource managers. Resource managers can use this information to meet performance goals, maintain power budgets, and obey thermal constraints. Unfortunately, obtaining the required machine introspection is challenging. Most current chips provide no support for per-core power monitoring, and when support exists, it is not exposed to software. We present a methodology for deriving per-core power models using sampled performance counter values and temperature sensor readings. We develop application-independent models for four different (four- to eight-core) platforms, validate their accuracy, and show how they can be used to guide scheduling decisions in power-aware resource managers.

Necessary and sufficient conditions for strong consensus and mean square consensus are respectively given for non-leader-follower and leader-follower cases under a fixed topology.

{"abstract": "Concurrency bugs are among the most difficult to test and diagnose of all software bugs. The multicore technology trend worsens this problem. Most previous concurrency bug detection work focuses on one bug subclass, data races, and neglects many other important ones such as  atomicity violations , which will soon become increasingly important due to the emerging trend of transactional memory models.This paper proposes an innovative, comprehensive, invariantbased approach called AVIO to detect atomicity violations. Our idea is based on a novel observation called  access interleaving invariant , which is a good indication of programmers' assumptions about the atomicity of certain code regions. By automatically extracting such invariants and detecting violations of these invariants at run time, AVIO can detect a variety of atomicity violations.Based on this idea, we have designed and built  two  implementations of AVIO and evaluated the  trade-offs  between them. The first implementation, AVIO-S, is purely in software, while the second, AVIO-H, requires some simple extensions to the cache coherence hardware. AVIO-S is cheaper and more accurate but incurs much higher overhead and thus more run-time perturbation than AVIOH. Therefore, AVIO-S is more suitable for in-house bug detection and postmortem bug diagnosis, while AVIO-H can be used for bug detection during production runs.We evaluate both implementations of AVIO using large realworld server applications (Apache and MySQL) with six representative real atomicity violation bugs, and SPLASH-2 benchmarks. Our results show that AVIO detects more tested atomicity violations of various types and has 25 times fewer false positives than previous solutions on average.", "authors": ["Shan Lu", "Joseph Tucek", "Feng Qin", "Yuanyuan Zhou"], "n_citation": 384, "references": ["119162d6-0403-4980-8096-f6fa5d9fc228", "136c4780-2f25-4068-90a5-aed6afaf2890", "1788761f-4652-4e50-a778-9ed73b9f4828", "20b606d4-3c15-4578-9cd2-bd68c2bf7f44", "23684c6e-6bd9-4fb9-af11-4b136cbf7cf7", "25b3b529-da12-492d-b8b5-9c525902fae4", "260e352b-b69c-4aa6-9418-7aa565278951", "2a1a717b-356a-44f6-a7cb-749ebcece1ef", "2c1bb963-f750-47df-ade9-d6881fd8dae8", "2d694676-76df-4997-a266-a9a42828283a", "2fad3463-c71d-4fdc-bb31-781e27b57f54", "35f68d1f-eb6a-4077-a358-c3905cb8acb4", "3bb902c9-554a-4ad9-a278-9b754bcad7f1", "3c9affe5-a987-43bd-89a9-68eb9762659b", "3ed7c3d2-992c-40ad-a7b6-df6e43a7d390", "4454f4ed-f386-47af-a620-45e899256811", "457a887b-0ff6-48f4-9413-c7785080fe86", "4ad1cd65-f232-422e-9010-82ddc33ee80e", "4afb35e7-b7a0-4349-b190-e656c2cdeb06", "58d23cb3-4d02-45db-a6ad-29eac443e20a", "6519becd-96d9-46cd-ac3e-19effbb08286", "6a99856e-831c-4bab-b4b9-1a08836a3f75", "6c20a4a2-0e3f-4446-b2e9-5f454d91b1c9", "6cc3357a-d3db-434a-95ed-8386e21c16a4", "824bdcf9-0415-4d86-b93f-3789fd2d053c", "8b9be692-831e-40e4-97eb-ceceb0a1c319", "a4f95e3a-17b0-46ed-a588-341d2bc53a33", "a6293eac-ef57-48c4-9c63-b3230198988a", "aaebd9ae-e5d3-470a-a52e-1a8c3a31d9d4", "b5894e8e-1774-45b2-9b34-23d2330878d0", "c7dda81c-0759-4906-9b8c-dc02aafacb05", "ca0f8470-acb8-4352-b016-366d161e0b13", "cb07a6bc-7acc-4eb5-964f-c8ece4a6ed65", "d31b5c99-09e5-4045-8021-127997fa477c", "d892fa95-e02d-4f99-8591-65596bc9c22a", "dc492c37-ce50-4729-bd27-6ce0f1b057cc", "df1bef6a-2d0b-4f23-b322-989d5560c8c9", "f18fd69b-88b1-4999-8a9c-c28122df0e3c", "f1d0ef04-b33d-4495-ace3-13679b1c4b60"], "title": "AVIO: detecting atomicity violations via access interleaving invariants", "venue": "architectural support for programming languages and operating systems", "year": 2006, "id": "c05c50aa-d4fa-4c47-bd26-dcb9b1853272"}

Unfortunately, this potential is not always fulfilled: many communities fail, and designers don't have a solid understanding of why. We know community activity begets activity. The trick, however, is to inspire participation in the first place. Social theories suggest methods to spark positive community participation. We carried out a field experiment that tested two such theories. We formed discussion communities around an existing movie recommendation web site, manipulating two factors: (1)  similarity -we controlled how similar group members' movie ratings were; and (2)  uniqueness -we told members how their movie ratings (with respect to a discussion topic) were unique within the group. Both factors positively influenced participation. The results offer a practical success story in applying social science theory to the design of online communities.", "authors": ["Pamela J.

{"abstract": "While class-based object-oriented programming languages provide a flexible mechanism for re-using and managing related pieces of code, they typically lack linguistic facilities for specifying a uniform extension of many classes with one set of fields and methods. As a result, programmers are unable to express certain abstractions over classes.In this paper we develop a model of class-to-class functions that we refer to as mixins. A mixin function maps a class to an extended class by adding or overriding fields and methods. Programming with mixins is similar to programming with single inheritance classes, but mixins more directly encourage programming to interfaces.The paper develops these ideas within the context of Java. The results are 1. an intuitive model of an essential Java subset; 2. an extension that explains and models mixins; and 3. type soundness theorems for these languages.", "authors": ["Matthew Flatt", "Shriram Krishnamurthi", "Matthias Felleisen"], "n_citation": 521, "references": ["1944ba14-3b3b-40ad-a316-866df5cac2ab", "21d3fc3b-da3e-4b5a-9d72-ac72a15df43b", "430bbcf6-56a0-4283-aa76-33e4d65640e8", "4824a33f-e32e-4a7c-a059-e0f0fea9e8ca", "53b10750-d5b0-4d21-8e7f-ee5e872ead47", "66bab8d7-ebf9-4145-bece-58d61ae29e87", "722234fb-7d26-448b-b3f5-047bb8f189d9", "7f1dc63a-9064-4768-a30d-3383d52aa81e", "8bb382cb-a7e3-4073-9987-7a5a3f2e9aff", "924a4ace-4757-4eab-8266-ca75154e5202", "9d202909-b6fd-454b-9bf5-5c4ead9cbc98", "a5fc93c7-d343-4d39-99c0-71050ad3a793", "ac84ad60-bdbb-4d64-a119-6e75fc1f657f", "b4120abc-68b5-4701-8cca-c14f4a2a46e8", "b7669901-5519-4445-b0d5-b029f854b6c3", "bb4fdd30-53f4-4e8e-ab09-5c62b604ee59"], "title": "Classes and mixins", "venue": "symposium on principles of programming languages", "year": 1998, "id": "e30b606d-f664-4588-a8cc-149c9476cc28"}

{"abstract": "Peer-to-peer (P2P) networking has become a household word in the past few years, being marketed as a work-around for server scalability problems and \"wonder drug\" to achieve resilience. Current widely-used P2P networks rely on central directory servers or massive message flooding, clearly not scalable solutions. Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are expected to eliminate flooding and central servers, but can require many long-haul message deliveries. We introduce Mithos, an content-addressable overlay network that only uses minimal routing information and is directly suitable as an underlay network for P2P systems, both using traditional and DHT addressing. Unlike other schemes, it also efficiently provides locality-aware connectivity, thereby ensuring that a message reaches its destination with minimal overhead. Mithos provides for highly efficient forwarding, making it suitable for use in high-throughput applications. Paired with its ability to have addresses directly mapped into a subspace of the IPv6 address space, it provides a potential candidate for native deployment. Additionally, Mithos can be used to support third-party triangulation to quickly select a close-by replica of data or services.", "authors": ["Marcel Waldvogel", "Roberto Rinaldi"], "n_citation": 233, "references": ["0695070f-320e-4d26-9c68-2c8faa20c944", "1545dfd3-2c25-4ff1-b43c-df4a2a501d06", "35bf84dd-82f4-4a45-a114-bfe8c635c2c4", "4152f693-19b7-4de5-bd38-d25341487814", "4743d708-b82d-42ec-adaa-a8bf2f23cc38", "4c36f482-1f7d-4a6c-a6f9-2e0a5b7056a4", "52eb8565-4e67-4e3d-96f0-73cebe0d11fc", "56fad217-58da-4f8a-8898-dc293ebc2002", "ae941637-b658-4a15-be8d-f32109e5f510", "c0a97389-451d-48ad-be97-b7d94b3aa02a", "e1263ada-afda-498c-a37d-9b545293118a", "e1c7443f-fbc7-4edc-919b-8f3bd2c1a34c", "f14df1ed-e3e9-4348-9040-fc06e3411b95"], "title": "Efficient topology-aware overlay network", "venue": "acm special interest group on data communication", "year": 2003, "id": "b38efc10-4cc8-4f2c-9df2-f96bf2203427"}

{"abstract": "Software is deterministic. Given a starting state and a fixed series of inputs, software will produce the exact same output every single time those inputs are applied. In fact, many of the technologies we apply during development (reviews, formal proofs, testing, and so forth) rely on this determinism; they would not work otherwise. But if software is deterministic, why do weird things happen? Why is it that we can apply a sequence of inputs and observe a failure and then be unable to reproduce that failure? Why does software work on one machine and fail on another? How is it that you can return from lunch and find your Web browser has crashed when it wasn't being used? The answer is, of course, that modern software processes an enormous number of inputs and only a small percentage of these inputs originate from human users. When testers can't reproduce failures, the reason is that they are only resubmitting the human input without sufficient regard to the operating system return codes and input from runtime libraries. When software fails on a new computer after running successfully on another, the reason can only be that the new system is supplying input that differs in content from the old one.

The rhetoric of the letter and the spirit, with great intellectual precedent, is used in this work to segregate the mundane and habitual aspects of narrative (the letter) from narrative's mystified, mythical, and aesthetic aspects (the spirit). Articulation, understood as the interplay between the letter and the spirit, has certain aesthetic modes, and these modes and their relationship to connotation, defamiliarization, and myth are discussed.   Also central to the aesthetic qualification of articulation is the cultural and cognitive backdrop against which an articulation occurs. This paper will argue that in the culture of our contemporary period, media-driven commodification of narratives has led to the saturation of the cultural narrative space with cliche. If a narrative is to be aesthetic in this environment, it must face the additional challenge of resisting hyperarticulation, as hyperarticulation invites unflattering comparison to known narrative forms and techniques. This paper concludes with a presentation of four strategies which support aesthetic articulation in narratives under the current cultural context - intertextuality, unusual representation, aesthetic signature, and personalization.", "authors": ["Hugo Liu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": [], "title": "Articulation, the letter, and the spirit in the aesthetics of narrative", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "id": "b31fc7e1-6436-4ecc-8b44-e3b73bfffcf9"}
{"abstract": "Since standardization in 2001, the Advanced Encryption Standard has been the subject of many research efforts, aimed at developing efficient hardware implementations with reduced area and latency. So far, reliability has not been considered a primary objective. Recently, several error detecting schemes have been proposed in order to provide some defense against hardware faults in AES. The benefits of such schemes are twofold: avoiding wrong outputs when benign hardware faults occur, and preventing the collection of information about the secret key through malicious injection of faults. In this paper, we present a complete scheme for parity-based fault detection in a hardware implementation of the Advanced Encryption Standard which includes a key schedule unit. We also provide a preliminary evaluation of the hardware and latency overhead of the proposed scheme.", "authors": ["Guido Bertoni", "Luca Breveglieri", "Israel Koren", "Paolo Maistri"], "n_citation": 62, "references": ["37947569-5ce6-4e84-857d-f73e821f0b37", "3bccc8d1-93b4-4440-a3e4-753e0f29ce96", "402937dd-6899-4773-8250-8ff8271144ad", "4f818994-f879-437c-8171-9f5655bb420b", "5e2be2af-bbc2-4c6b-8375-4a33fd77dad3", "5e9542ed-3169-4fc4-bffc-7578d6cb7657", "80349cd8-c73e-41f0-b4a7-b09a9ffc68ff", "94b36295-5766-4d5f-8100-e2a2f44d057f", "9a759b82-6bce-477b-8516-0ebb441a1cfe", "c527c31a-663f-43e2-ba0d-82cb11a07f4d", "c77c7a91-a4a1-4874-b80a-7c7e2c36b051", "ce299141-94e7-4791-a7fa-7c7774ea4b67", "d0887dbf-65be-480d-8b40-bf954406ad11"], "title": "An efficient hardware-based fault diagnosis scheme for AES: performances and cost", "venue": "defect and fault tolerance in vlsi and nanotechnology systems", "year": 2004, "id": "6ef53f30-507d-48b8-82f9-23cc45f55c9c"}

{"abstract": "Wireless sensor networks are usually energy limited and therefore an energy-efficient routing algorithm is desired for prolonging the network lifetime. In this paper, we propose a new energy balance routing algorithm which has the following three improvements over the conventional LEACH algorithm. Firstly, we propose a new cluster head selection scheme by taking into consideration the remaining energy and the most recent energy consumption of the nodes and the entire network. In this way, the sensor nodes with smaller remaining energy or larger energy consumption will be much less likely to be chosen as cluster heads. Secondly, according to the ratio of remaining energy to distance, cooperative nodes are selected to form virtual MIMO structures. It mitigates the uneven distribution of clusters and the unbalanced energy consumption of the whole network. Thirdly, we construct a comprehensive energy consumption model, which can reflect more realistically the practical energy consumption. Numerical simulations analyze the influences of cooperative node numbers and cluster head node numbers on the network lifetime. It is shown that the energy consumption of the proposed routing algorithm is lower than the conventional LEACH algorithm and for the simulation example the network lifetime is prolonged about 25&#x25;.", "authors": ["Jianpo Li", "Xue Jiang", "I-Tai Lu"], "n_citation": 27, "references": ["1ee4b656-7d2c-45e8-b2e8-b5633b992eeb", "23dd7fc0-1ebd-43ce-ab3e-43896512c209", "25c9f63c-eaca-4b58-bfbe-4e2ab131862b", "303bb9fd-86fc-40b8-99bb-b8ed52955ed2", "461cb1e0-a7f3-4d18-b006-f34748fca210", "477f05a3-580f-4353-a390-51bb2125f0c8", "4c850dde-3042-4d3f-895c-5e0049700172", "6ba6f222-dd5c-451a-8f9e-4a81d9105ee1", "7afd86e4-7bab-4c6a-8582-979a86067b69", "7fecb5e5-4b7c-4199-bd4c-c7b53dba31d2", "88aa8ef6-ab3a-468a-b01e-8bb171d290d2", "bddc60b7-45f3-4de3-926f-52268a783cce", "fbb3e109-80c8-4bd7-a520-4d88bf1be5cb"], "title": "Energy Balance Routing Algorithm Based on Virtual MIMO Scheme for Wireless Sensor Networks", "venue": "Journal of Sensors", "year": 2014, "id": "cf871538-a8d1-47df-bc1b-0ed583031dc1"}

Here, the authors showed how non-cooperation causes unacceptable degradation in quality of results, and present an economic protocol to address this problem. This protocol, called the RTR protocol, is based on the buying and selling of the right-to-respond (RTR) to each query in the network.

{"abstract": "A consequence of the growing number of empirical studies in software engineering is the need to adopt systematic approaches to assessing and aggregating research outcomes in order to provide a balanced and objective summary of research evidence for a particular topic. The paper reports experiences with applying one such approach, the practice of systematic literature review, to the published studies relevant to topics within the software engineering domain. The systematic literature review process is summarised, a number of reviews being undertaken by the authors and others are described and some lessons about the applicability of this practice to software engineering are extracted.The basic systematic literature review process seems appropriate to software engineering and the preparation and validation of a review protocol in advance of a review activity is especially valuable. The paper highlights areas where some adaptation of the process to accommodate the domain-specific characteristics of software engineering is needed as well as areas where improvements to current software engineering infrastructure and practices would enhance its applicability. In particular, infrastructure support provided by software engineering indexing databases is inadequate. Also, the quality of abstracts is poor; it is usually not possible to judge the relevance of a study from a review of the abstract alone.", "authors": ["Pearl Brereton", "Barbara Kitchenham", "David Budgen", "Mark Turner", "M.

{"abstract": "Product management is a key success factor for software products as it spans the entire life-cycle and thus ensures both a technical and business perspective. With its many interfaces to various business processes and stakeholders across the life-cycle, it is a primary driver for requirements engineering in its focus on value-orientation and consistency across releases. This article provides an overview on product management in software and IT. It summarizes experiences with introducing, improving and deploying the role of a product manager. In order to get a profound industry overview we performed a field study with interviews and concrete insight across fifteen different organizations world-wide on the role of the product manager and its success factors. As a technical solution we present four success factors identified from the research and show how they address the challenges we identified in practice. The novel part of this research and technical study is the industry survey and evaluation of resulting solution proposals.

{"abstract": "PCUBE, a performance driven placement algorithm for minimizing power consumption, is described. The problem is formulated as a constrained programming problem and is solved in two phases: global optimization and slot assignment. The objective function used during either phase is the total weighted net length, where net weights are calculated as the expected switching activities of gates driving the nets. Constraints on total path delays are also accounted for. On average, PCUBE reduces power consumption due to interconnect by 7% at the expense of 8% increase in the total wire length and 2% increase in circuit delay. >", "authors": ["Hirendu Vaishnav", "Massoud Pedram"], "n_citation": 91, "references": ["1eba2d3e-6327-43b3-a63f-a01fb75d6250", "2174b19d-aa10-450e-9a70-907b6a1d6a87", "299d7e1f-1710-43d2-83da-aa751238de8b", "53af1e54-b5de-4d76-b999-55f0e87ad5b2", "6ec12ff5-7f3b-4668-a5cf-9808323d956a", "72713348-fa27-4040-83cf-89be4cb3b03e", "7f64f404-a98f-4e83-a18b-8b40d15a7060", "911e85b3-0815-4846-9807-d62cf9941574"], "title": "PCUBE: A performance driven placement algorithm for low power designs", "venue": "design automation conference", "year": 1993, "id": "155d4098-602e-4309-b870-b6faefca3607"}

{"abstract": "Peer-to-peer networks are mainly unstructured, where no specific topology is imposed on the network during its operations. These networks offer a high degree of resilience against network dynamics disrupting the network's operation. Unstructured networks, based on random connections are limited, however, in the performance and node reachability they can offer to applications. In contrast, structured networks impose predetermined connectivity relationships between nodes in order to offer a guarantee on the diameter between requesting nodes and the requested objects. We observe that neither structured nor unstructured networks can simultaneously offer both good performance and resilience in a single algorithm. To address this challenge, we propose Phenix, a peer-to-peer algorithm that can construct low-diameter resilient topologies. Phenix supports low diameter operations by creating a topology of nodes whose degree distribution follows a power-law, while the implementation of the underlying algorithm is fully distributed requiring no central server, thus, eliminating the possibility of a single point of failure in the system. We present the design and evaluation of the algorithm and show through analysis, simulation, and experimental results obtained from an implementation on the PlanetLab testbed that Phenix is robust to network dynamics such as joins/leaves, node failure and large-scale network attacks, while maintaining low overhead when implemented in an experimental network.", "authors": ["Rita H.

{"abstract": "Cyber-physical systems integrate computation, communication, and physical capabilities to interact with the physical world and humans. Besides failures of components, cyber-physical systems are prone to malignant attacks, and specific analysis tools as well as monitoring mechanisms need to be developed to enforce system security and reliability. This paper proposes a unified framework to analyze the resilience of cyber-physical systems against attacks cast by an omniscient adversary. We model cyber-physical systems as linear descriptor systems, and attacks as exogenous unknown inputs. Despite its simplicity, our model captures various real-world cyber-physical systems, and it includes and generalizes many prototypical attacks, including stealth, (dynamic) false-data injection and replay attacks. First, we characterize fundamental limitations of static, dynamic, and active monitors for attack detection and identification. Second, we provide constructive algebraic conditions to cast undetectable and unidentifiable attacks. Third, by using the system interconnection structure, we describe graph-theoretic conditions for the existence of undetectable and unidentifiable attacks.

{"abstract": "Much recent work has focussed on the bottom-up evaluation of Datalog programs. One approach, called Magic-Sets, is based on rewriting a logic program so that bottom-up fixpoint evaluation of the program avoids generation of irrelevant facts ([BMSU86, BR87, Ram88]). It is widely believed that the principal application of the Magic-Sets technique is to restrict computation in recursive queries using equijoin predicates. We extend the Magic-Set transformation to use predicates other than equality ( X  > 10, for example). This Extended Magic-Set technique has practical utility in \u201creal\u201d relational databases, not only for recursive queries, but for non-recursive queries as well; in ([MFPR90]) we use the results in this paper and those in [MPR89] to define a magic-set transformation for relational databases supporting SQL and its extensions, going on to describe an implementation of magic in Starburst ([HFLP89]).

{"abstract": "In this paper, a communication-based load scheduling protocol is proposed for in-home appliances connected over a home area network. Specifically, a joint access and scheduling approach for appliances is developed to enable in-home appliances to coordinate power usage so that the total energy demand for the home is kept below a target value. The proposed protocol considers both \u201cschedulable\u201d appliances which have delay flexibility, and \u201ccritical\u201d appliances which consume power as they desire. An optimization problem is formulated for the energy management controller to decide the target values for each time slot, by incorporating the variation of electricity prices and distributed wind power uncertainty. We model the evolution of the protocol as a two-dimensional Markov chain, and derive the steady-state distribution, by which the average delay of an appliance is then obtained.

In particular, we show that the use of round robin ensembles will also increase the classification performance of decision tree learners, even though they can directly handle multi-class problems. The performance gain is not as large as for bagging and boosting, but on the other hand round robin ensembles have a clearly defined semantics. Furthermore, we investigate whether confidence estimates can be used to improve the accuracy of the predictions of the ensemble.

{"abstract": "Wireless mesh networks (WMNs) have attracted much attention lately for providing efficiently wireless services with high quality of service (QoS). Metropolitan WMNs are a low-cost solution for providing broadband wireless internet access in large areas. One of the fundamental issues of wireless communications is interference. In WMNs interference can be caused by simultaneous transmissions at links internal to the mesh network or by external sources. In this work we perform extensive measurements in a multi-radio metropolitan WMN deployed in the city of Heraklion, Greece. The basic goal is to investigate the impact of interference on the performance of the multi-path WMN. Towards that goal, we perform measurements with FTP, video streaming and raw data traffic for two scenarios, one with an efficient channel assignment (CA) that accounts for interference and another with a random CA that results in high internal and external interference in the network. The results prove that interference creates severe performance degradation, with regards to high delay, high packet losses, low throughput and low signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR). As a result, the metropolitan WMN becomes unable to support multi-path flows and demanding applications with an acceptable QoS.", "authors": ["Elias Z. Tragos", "Alexandros G.

{"abstract": "A software birthmark is a unique characteristic of a program. Thus, comparing the birthmarks between the plaintiff and defendant programs provides an effective approach for software plagiarism detection. However, software birthmark generation faces two main challenges: the absence of source code and various code obfuscation techniques that attempt to hide the characteristics of a program. In this paper, we propose a new type of software birthmark called DYnamic Key Instruction Sequence (DYKIS) that can be extracted from an executable without the need for source code.

{"abstract": "The tremendous rate of growth in the mobile app market over the past few years has attracted many developers to build mobile apps. However, while there is no shortage of stories of how lone developers have made great fortunes from their apps, the majority of developers are struggling to break even. For those struggling developers, knowing the \u201cDNA\u201d (i.e., characteristics) of high-rated apps is the first step towards successful development and evolution of their apps. In this paper, we investigate 28 factors along eight dimensions to understand how high-rated apps are different from low-rated apps. We also investigate what are the most influential factors by applying a random-forest classifier to identify high-rated apps. Through a case study on 1,492 high-rated and low-rated free apps mined from the Google Play store, we find that high-rated apps are statistically significantly different in 17 out of the 28 factors that we considered. Our experiment also shows that the size of an app, the number of promotional images that the app displays on its web store page, and the target SDK version of an app are the most influential factors.", "authors": ["Yuan Tian", "Meiyappan Nagappan", "David Lo", "Ahmed E.

{"abstract": "In this paper we consider the stochastic optimal control problem of discrete-time Markov jump with multiplicative noise linear systems. The performance criterion is assumed to be formed by a linear combination of a quadratic part and a linear part in the state and control variables. The weighting matrices of the state and control for the quadratic part are allowed to be indefinite. We present a necessary and sufficient condition under which the problem is well posed and a state feedback solution can be derived from a set of coupled generalized Riccati difference equations interconnected with a set of coupled linear recursive equations. For the case in which the quadratic-term matrices are non-negative, this necessary and sufficient condition can be written in a more explicit way. The results are applied to a problem of portfolio optimization.", "authors": ["Oswaldo Luiz V.

{"abstract": "Hybrid inference systems are an important way to address the fact that intelligent systems have muiltifaceted representational and reasoning competence. KRYPTON is an experimental prototype that competently handles both terminological and assertional knowledge; these two kinds of information are tightly linked by having sentences in an assertional component be formed using structured complex predicates denned in a complementary terminological component. KRYPTON is unique in that it combines in a completely integrated fashion a frame-based description language and a first-order resolution theorem-prover. We give here both a formal Knowledge Level view of the user interface to KRYPTON and the technical Symbol Level details of the integration of the two disparate components, thus providing an essential picture of the abstract function that KRYPTON computes and the implementation technology needed to make it work. We also illustrate the kind of complex question the system can answer.", "authors": ["Ronald J. Brachman", "Victoria Pigman Gilbert", "H.

{"abstract": "With the phenomenal growth of the Internet and open networks in general, security services, such as non-repudiation, become crucial to many applications. Non-repudiation services must ensure that when Alice sends some information to Bob over a network, neither Alice nor Bob can deny having participated in a part or the whole of this communication. Therefore a fair non-repudiation protocol has to generate non-repudiation of origin evidences intended to Bob, and non-repudiation of receipt evidences destined to Alice. In this paper, we clearly define the properties a fair non-repudiation protocol must respect, and give a survey of the most important non-repudiation protocols without and with trusted third party (TTP). For the later ones we discuss the evolution of the TTP's involvement and, between others, describe the most recent protocol using a transparent TTP. We also discuss some ad-hoc problems related to the management of non-repudiation evidences.", "authors": ["Steve Kremer", "Olivier Markowitch", "Jianying Zhou"], "n_citation": 348, "references": ["127616ff-3aef-4968-9bfd-2aa96b064751", "19799e24-d2f1-42ab-8b01-9cfe41708d32", "286cfc44-47d5-4662-b8a7-23a08c5d7951", "2b0327ca-3162-4d90-8d2c-df4d612fc45b", "35ce170e-c80a-4b55-b37d-468146ac2192", "377098a0-1e66-4d96-b185-0546dff94a9b", "3db0515b-6e9c-46d6-9897-3b2b6002256f", "3edc6d75-cbe2-42a9-8f21-bb4061526d8d", "4a441680-925e-453a-9817-720afd6e1808", "4e61c95c-3547-402d-b565-8374173e8ba0", "56895e01-2e9f-4182-9073-29c27cb4f440", "6854c510-72fc-4e55-8b52-561b60a532ad", "6f5d2190-c2bb-49fd-a44c-06edcef8d878", "7f84329a-28ab-4b07-bb59-e2808ebd6482", "89266541-12d4-4c9b-ab99-887ebbd6dda0", "8c882d23-e4a5-43d9-a201-c2b1f49fd964", "8d36edf2-676c-4f55-8e3d-e64a2ff4c251", "9d15a808-c9f2-4cd5-8ade-c5008dbdb868", "a1018236-0dd5-4319-a3e5-be9c42807b25", "a1d95cca-dc1e-4c81-a554-35113aed50dc", "acd3f571-3433-4527-9a8a-d0ff83b69a7e", "b2debf77-1bd9-439b-8157-610061d286d4", "b5f3624f-1081-45fc-9ebc-dae362e95304", "bf267250-812b-412c-96b7-dd6b10e16d6c", "c0978090-5959-4e4c-acce-d3447cbdbf8b", "c118bc91-1a46-4d54-81dc-63bb29e9b34a", "ca394e6a-59e0-466c-a66a-d976555db689", "d9053f7e-5749-43a6-8f5a-1074917c58bb", "fa3c069d-41b7-440e-b9be-9a4d95cd6b94"], "title": "An intensive survey of fair non-repudiation protocols", "venue": "Computer Communications", "year": 2002, "id": "3354c113-fe2b-4437-989b-86dc24449267"}

{"abstract": "From the Publisher:#R##N#The book discusses a new approach to requirements engineering. The goal of the method described is to facilitate the requirements engineering process and to improve the quality of its results. The focus of the book is on how linguistic instruments can be used profitably in this process, in order to reach this goal. The book gives a rather complete overview of the current status of requirements engineering, including (object-oriented) software analysis, and of applications of natural language to information systems in general. The improvements to the requirements engineering process include a better understanding of the problem and its domain, expressed by abstract models upon the contents of which the users (i.e. the 'owners' of the problem) have agreed. The process of collecting, specifying, verifying and validating the contents of the models is elaborated extensively. The linguistic meaning and definition of the words and concepts, that are selected from the Universe of Discourse description by a natural language- and scenario-based analysis approach, provides a semantically correct base for both the requirements specification and requirements validation. Some well-known problems with natural language texts, like ambiguity and incompleteness, are avoided by this semantic approach. The word meanings are retrieved from a lexicon that is interactively consulted during the requirements engineering process. The formal language that has been introduced as the underlying representation formalism for the lexicon, the models, as well as the original natural language sentences gives possibilities for verification activities, because of its logic foundation. Two models are introduced that arevalidated by the users by checking natural language sentences that are equivalent to the models' contents, and by evaluating a prototype that simulates the modeled behaviour of the system. Summarizing, the book introduces a requirements engineering method which makes heavily use of linguistic instruments. The method is described from several viewpoints, which includes its philosophy (the way of thinking), its techniques (the way of modeling), its use (the way of working) and a sketch of its supporting environment, (the way of supporting).", "authors": ["J.

{"abstract": "Survey research is believed to be well understood and applied by management information systems (MIS) scholars. It has been applied for several years and it has precise procedures which, when followed closely, yield valid and easily interpretable data. Our assessment of the use of survey research in the MIS field between 1980 and 1990 indicates that this perception is at odds with reality. Our analysis indicates that survey methodology is often misapplied and is plagued by five important weaknesses: (1) single-method designs where multiple methods are needed, (2) unsystematic and often inadequate sampling procedures, (3) low response rates, (4) weak linkages between units of analysis and respondents, and (5) overreliance on cross-sectional surveys where longitudinal surveys are really needed. Our assessment also shows that the quality of survey research varies considerably among studies of different purposes: explanatory studies are of good quality overall, exploratory and descriptive studies are of moderate to poor quality. This article presents a general framework for classifying and examining survey research and uses this framework to analyze the usage of survey research conducted in the past decade in the MIS field. In an effort to improve the quality of survey research, this article makes specific recommenoations that directly address the major problems highlighted in the review.", "authors": ["Alain Pinsonneault", "Kenneth L.

{"abstract": "With the success of libre (free, open source) software, a new type of software compilation has become increasingly common. Such compilations, often referred to as 'distributions', group hundreds, if not thousands, of software applications and libraries written by independent parties into an integrated system. Software compilations raise a number of questions that have not been targeted so far by software evolution, which usually focuses on the evolution of single applications. Undoubtedly, the challenges that software compilations face differ from those found in single software applications. Nevertheless, it can be assumed that both, the evolution of applications and that of software compilations, have similarities and dependencies.In this sense, we identify a dichotomy, common to that in economics, of software evolution in the small (micro-evolution) and in the large (macro-evolution). The goal of this paper is to study the evolution of a large software compilation, mining the publicly available repository of a well-known Linux distribution, Debian. We will therefore investigate changes related to hundreds of millions of lines of code over seven years. The aspects that will be covered in this paper are size (in terms of number of packages and of number of lines of code), use of programming languages, maintenance of packages and file sizes.", "authors": ["Gregorio Robles", "Jesus M.

{"abstract": "We describe a new side-channel attack. By tracking changes in the application's memory footprint, a concurrent process belonging to a different user can learn its secrets. Using Web browsers as the target, we show how an unprivileged, local attack process - for example, a malicious Android app - can infer which page the user is browsing, as well as finer-grained information: whether she is a paid customer, her interests, etc. This attack is an instance of a broader problem. Many isolation mechanisms in modern systems reveal accounting information about program execution, such as memory usage and CPU scheduling statistics. If temporal changes in this public information are correlated with the program's secrets, they can lead to a privacy breach. To illustrate the pervasiveness of this problem, we show how to exploit scheduling statistics for keystroke sniffing in Linux and Android, and how to combine scheduling statistics with the dynamics of memory usage for more accurate adversarial inference of browsing behavior.", "authors": ["Suman Jana", "Vitaly Shmatikov"], "n_citation": 112, "references": ["30808881-b45c-4c3b-9c27-3e1b40400761", "46a84d91-5a04-42ba-8d0d-6a24a19fe631", "50ceb126-690a-4c53-99fe-021b4a8068ae", "5a34af3b-d06f-4852-9c5d-4f44935b0579", "5bf59499-322b-4b0d-b422-a10ee466fc29", "6c3f23d6-969f-46e3-8810-c96d0ced61e5", "6c5d5bb4-52ed-45da-bceb-71525b70fafc", "869f6b48-8d38-4d55-96d2-3e0cc26e9436", "b538093b-7736-47ca-8793-09c79a0238b1", "b80bc6fa-0894-4801-9d6e-a1f9135ce1a8", "d3df5509-7087-4891-b8ed-95f27f2b97b6", "e41c1620-5347-4557-9c5d-6b9f2cef16f2", "ef31a6a4-08e0-4873-82cf-fdeb5cdbeb40", "f92d6fa2-1e15-4161-907b-42dfbbb226e5"], "title": "Memento: Learning Secrets from Process Footprints", "venue": "ieee symposium on security and privacy", "year": 2012, "id": "a24d5e0b-203b-4ea5-959a-4495ee4d106d"}
{"abstract": "Recently there has been significant research in multiple-instance learning, yet most of this work has only considered this model when there are Boolean labels. However, in many of the application areas for which the multiple-instance model fits, real-valued labels are more appropriate than Boolean labels. We define and study a real-valued multiple-instance model in which each multiple-instance example (bag) is given a real-valued label in [0, 1] that indicates the degree to which the bag satisfies the target concept. To provide additional structure to the learning problem, we associate a real-valued label with each point in the bag. These values are then combined using a real-valued aggregation operator to obtain the label for the bag. We then present on-line agnostic algorithms for learning real-valued multiple-instance geometric concepts defined by axis-aligned boxes in constant-dimensional space and describe several possible applications of these algorithms. We obtain our learning algorithms by reducing the problem to one in which the exponentiated gradient or gradient descent algorithm can be used. We also give a novel application of the virtual weights technique. In typical applications of the virtual weights technique, all of the concepts in a group have the same weight and prediction, allowing a single \u201crepresentative\u201d concept from each group to be tracked. However, in our application there are an exponential number of different weights and possible predictions. Hence, boxes in each group have different weights and predictions, making the computation of the contribution of a group significantly more involved. However, we are able to both keep the number of groups polynomial in the number of trials and efficiently compute the overall prediction.", "authors": ["Sally A. Goldman", "Stephen D.

{"abstract": "Image registration is an often encountered problem in various fields including medical imaging, computer vision and image processing. Numerous algorithms for registering image data have been reported in these areas. In this paper, we present a novel curve evolution approach expressed in a level-set framework to achieve image intensity morphing and a simple non-linear PDE for the corresponding coordinate registration. The key features of the intensity morphing model are that (a) it is very fast and (b) existence and uniqueness of the solution for the evolution model are established in a Sobolev space as opposed to using viscosity methods. The salient features of the coordinate registration model are its simplicity and computational efficiency. The intensity morph is easily achieved via evolving level-sets of one image into the level-sets of the other. To explicitly estimate the coordinate transformation between the images, we derive a non-linear PDE-based motion model which can be solved very efficiently. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a variety of images including synthetic and real data. As an application of the PDE-based motion model, atlas based segmentation of hippocampal shape from several MR brain scans is depicted. In each of these experiments, automated hippocampal shape recovery results are validated via manual \u2018expert\u2019 segmentations.", "authors": ["Baba C. Vemuri", "J.

{"abstract": "The skeletal implementation pattern is a software design pattern consisting of defining an abstract class that provides a partial interface implementation. However, since Java allows only single class inheritance, if implementers decide to extend a skeletal implementation, they will not be allowed to extend any other class. Also, discovering the skeletal implementation may require a global analysis. Java 8 enhanced interfaces alleviate these problems by allowing interfaces to contain (default) method implementations, which implementers inherit. Java classes are then free to extend a different class, and a separate abstract class is no longer needed; developers considering implementing an interface need only examine the interface itself.

{"abstract": "If all dependent expressions were adjacent some variety of immediate constituent analysis would suffice for grammar, but syntactic and semantic mismatches are characteristic of natural language; indeed this is a, or the, central problem in grammar. Logical categorial grammar reduces grammar to logic: an expression is well-formed if and only if an associated sequent is a theorem of a categorial logic. The paradigmatic categorial logic is the Lambek calculus, but being a logic of concatenation the Lambek calculus can only capture discontinuous dependencies when they are peripheral. In this paper we present the displacement calculus, which is a logic of intercalation as well as concatenation and which subsumes the Lambek calculus. On the empirical side, we apply the new calculus to discontinuous idioms, quantification, VP ellipsis, medial extraction, pied-piping, appositive relativisation, parentheticals, gapping, comparative subdeletion, cross-serial dependencies, reflexivization, anaphora, dative alternation, and particle shift. On the technical side, we prove that the calculus enjoys Cut-elimination.", "authors": ["Glyn Morrill", "Oriol Valent\u00edn", "Mario Fadda"], "n_citation": 71, "references": ["1ee48b38-4ebd-44a4-8a96-f7c5109850e8", "373f9c8b-b209-4349-a4de-2e327c4bf71e", "426376e6-3e41-40b2-a4f5-0ab8c44a2da9", "4b19a31c-f875-42fe-9287-cea4885dc1ee", "7421b5a2-6ad3-48d8-8f93-ec0b9c525c5d", "74ac6adf-263f-48e1-9041-48ace79ae5db", "795605d4-db11-4846-8319-0f19c365499b", "9193a424-a4be-455f-8f4e-003e1e0ef9c3", "a69773d5-de0f-4b39-862a-93abbe5bbd41", "aa44dd48-8e1b-4c0e-b79e-95e3bf683345", "c00263c1-70a2-41a3-b3f1-ff9a85183fef", "ed31dc39-6f36-4950-b704-e4c55c1e1964"], "title": "The Displacement Calculus", "venue": "Journal of Logic, Language and Information", "year": 2011, "id": "42455c89-2145-410a-bdb4-c2ae937abb70"}
{"abstract": "Micropipelines are self-timed pipelines with characteristics that suggest they may be applicable to low-power circuits. They were originally designed with two-phase control, but four-phase control appears to offer benefits for CMOS implementations. In low-power applications static circuit behaviour is desirable since it allows activity to cease (and hence power to be saved) without loss of state. However, dynamic circuits offer the benefits of increased speed and lower switched capacitance. Therefore low-power designs often employ dynamic logic with additional latches or charge-retention circuits to give pseudo-static behaviour. These additions increase the cost and power consumption of the dynamic circuits, thereby compromising their potential advantages. Circuits are proposed in this paper that allow dynamic logic to operate efficiently within a four-phase micropipeline framework without the above-mentioned encumbrances whilst still retaining externally static behaviour.", "authors": ["Stephen B.

Large bandwidth-delay products of high-speed networks also render some of the existing error and flow control mechanisms less efficient.

This paper presents the design, evaluation, and implementation of an application-oriented error control-scheme that is aimed at supporting efficient IPC in high-speed networking environments.

{"abstract": "Caching approximate values instead of exact values presents an opportunity for performance gains in exchange for decreased precision. To maximize the performance improvement, cached approximations must be of appropriate precision: approximations that are too precise easily become invalid, requiring frequent refreshing, while overly imprecise approximations are likely to be useless to applications, which must then bypass the cache. We present a parameterized algorithm for adjusting the precision of cached approximations adaptively to achieve the best performance as data values, precision requirements, or workload vary. We consider interval approximations to numeric values but our ideas can be extended to other kinds of data and approximations. Our algorithm strictly generalizes previous adaptive caching algorithms for exact copies: we can set parameters to require that all approximations be exact, in which case our algorithm dynamically chooses whether or not to cache each data value.  We have implemented our algorithm and tested it on synthetic and real-world data. A number of experimental results are reported, showing the effectiveness of our algorithm at maximizing performance, and also showing that in the special case of exact caching our algorithm performs as well as previous algorithms. In cases where bounded imprecision is acceptable, our algorithm easily outperforms previous algorithms for exact caching.", "authors": ["Chris Olston", "Boon Thau Loo", "Jennifer Widom"], "n_citation": 261, "references": ["0391b28c-a003-4476-80d4-af0c0bf296ac", "27b24e7f-9310-41a6-bc12-1fcf37cf928a", "2cbe3ba2-f561-4904-afec-2fc6ed24d5ba", "36a7fb38-ef37-4508-90c6-b2d5b561ffd2", "68d8b37b-ae31-4585-95ea-e2e859a7ecbc", "6a702ef7-7442-4631-bedb-5962d8bf1e80", "71eb7ad2-1347-48c3-9093-53c24a455c1b", "762215eb-18fe-470b-835b-b890f5933af9", "98debd63-8921-4518-a887-8751ee97383f", "a5f03d59-b6f6-4dbc-9c66-632fc144d0f7", "afd4c865-5c81-424b-82c3-1dcb6150ea6d", "c827d57c-cb0d-4732-9d09-355af5fb9967", "dbb76bac-9f81-43fb-86d4-eeff0a1eb0b0", "f3179a9a-0632-46d5-bc6c-401c1279f35f"], "title": "Adaptive precision setting for cached approximate values", "venue": "international conference on management of data", "year": 2001, "id": "32ed7703-e95e-457f-84d2-c8f6e15edf2c"}

{"abstract": "In this contribution we present extensions of the Self Organizing Map and clustering methods for the categorization and visualization of data which are described by matrices rather than feature vectors. Rows and Columns of these matrices correspond to objects which may or may not belong to the same set, and the entries in the matrix describe the relationships between them. The clustering task is formulated as an optimization problem: Model complexity is minimized under the constraint, that the error one makes when reconstructing objects from class information is fixed, usually to a small value. The data is then visualized with help of modified Self Organizing Maps methods, i.e. by constructing a neighborhood preserving non-linear projection into a low-dimensional \"map-space\". Grouping of data objects is done using an improved optimization technique, which combines deterministic annealing with \"growing\" techniques. Performance of the new methods is evaluated by applying them to two kinds of matrix data: (i) pairwise data, where row and column objects are from the same set and where matrix elements denote dissimilarity values and (ii) co-occurrence data, where row and column objects are from different sets and where the matrix elements describe how often object pairs occur.", "authors": ["Sambu Seo", "Klaus Obermayer"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["15c30ca5-6af6-4acf-b8c5-f2c0e18e6ad8", "1691a31e-e9a3-4002-b78d-1190a45fbc3e", "2834deb1-eaf2-40c8-899c-fdf2d28e556f", "28903e7b-aa3b-4840-b634-916029ed6c77", "34ba2e35-f5cf-4ca9-aeb7-318f6eca57c5", "38135245-8eff-4078-af6a-ea559ffa660b", "3e688de7-3539-4435-97aa-de05042ec601", "46de26e3-1761-4656-bcc3-5a39b1b4c7b3", "4a29b56b-b74e-4945-9017-61a7ab844fd9", "4e6f22d6-473d-4377-ac47-baba338fc59d", "73869616-a8ee-4147-af16-33cd010d7e01", "9eb4bb10-1cc7-478e-916f-04a072a87751", "adba2f15-aaf6-4009-a0e5-3585d03316fa", "bcc3d060-ec38-4d1f-9df8-360d026e17b6", "cbff2ff2-6b8f-425d-a5ef-aff0de9be3e5", "ce6b7910-67b1-4388-86d5-da2a369ba9d9", "d3cdc55c-a844-4d30-9171-d3233a3f0c1b", "d69ac865-0323-4a3d-92aa-a1aff7065add", "dc697d9d-f1af-4c54-a87a-d8f49917c031", "dde5d677-b994-4729-9307-ea602c58a734", "f4ded15e-fab3-4896-86de-2abc73b4f9e9"], "title": "Self-organizing maps and clustering methods for matrix data", "venue": "Neural Networks", "year": 2004, "id": "d83ecffc-64a2-4afe-bb8e-6f6831d28102"}

{"abstract": "In recent years, there has been a proliferation of declarative logic-based trust management languages and systems proposed to ease the description, configuration, and enforcement of security policies. These systems have dierent tradeos in expressiveness and complexity, depending on the security constructs (e.g. authentication, delegation, secrecy, etc.) that are supported, and the assumed trust level and scale of the execution environment. In this paper, we present LBTrust, a unified declarative system for reconfigurable trust management, where various security constructs can be customized and composed in a declarative fashion. We present an initial proof-of-concept implementation of LBTrust using LogicBlox, an emerging commercial Datalog-based platform for enterprise software systems. The LogicBlox language enhances Datalog in a variety of ways, including constraints and meta-programming, as well as support for programmerdefined constraints on the meta-model itself \u2010 meta-constraints \u2010 which act to restrict the set of allowable programs. LBTrust utilizes LogicBlox\u2019s meta-programming and meta-constraints to enable customizable cryptographic, partitioning and distribution strategies based on the execution environment.

{"abstract": "This paper describes a novel approach for signature verification and identification in an offline environment based on a quasi-multiresolution technique using GSC (Gradient, Structural and Concavity) features for feature extraction. These features when used at the word level, instead of the character level, yield promising results with accuracies as high as 78% and 93% for verification and identification, respectively. This method was successfully employed in our previous theory of individuality of handwriting developed at CEDAR \u2014 based on obtaining within and between writer statistical distance distributions.

A recent study by Ein-Dor [7] concludes that it is most effective to accomplish any task on the least powerful type of computer capable of performing it.

{"abstract": "This paper surveys fitness functions used in the field of evolutionary robotics (ER). Evolutionary robotics is a field of research that applies artificial evolution to generate control systems for autonomous robots. During evolution, robots attempt to perform a given task in a given environment. The controllers in the better performing robots are selected, altered and propagated to perform the task again in an iterative process that mimics some aspects of natural evolution. A key component of this process-one might argue, the key component-is the measurement of fitness in the evolving controllers. ER is one of a host of machine learning methods that rely on interaction with, and feedback from, a complex dynamic environment to drive synthesis of controllers for autonomous agents. These methods have the potential to lead to the development of robots that can adapt to uncharacterized environments and which may be able to perform tasks that human designers do not completely understand. In order to achieve this, issues regarding fitness evaluation must be addressed. In this paper we survey current ER research and focus on work that involved real robots. The surveyed research is organized according to the degree of a priori knowledge used to formulate the various fitness functions employed during evolution. The underlying motivation for this is to identify methods that allow the development of the greatest degree of novel control, while requiring the minimum amount of a priori task knowledge from the designer.", "authors": ["Andrew L.

{"abstract": "Gabor features have been known to be effective for face recognition. However, only a few approaches utilize phase feature and they usually perform worse than those using magnitude feature. To investigate the potential of Gabor phase and its fusion with magnitude for face recognition, in this paper, we first propose local Gabor XOR patterns (LGXP), which encodes the Gabor phase by using the local XOR pattern (LXP) operator. Then, we introduce block-based Fisher's linear discriminant (BFLD) to reduce the dimensionality of the proposed descriptor and at the same time enhance its discriminative power. Finally, by using BFLD, we fuse local patterns of Gabor magnitude and phase for face recognition. We evaluate our approach on FERET and FRGC 2.0 databases. In particular, we perform comparative experimental studies of different local Gabor patterns. We also make a detailed comparison of their combinations with BFLD, as well as the fusion of different descriptors by using BFLD. Extensive experimental results verify the effectiveness of our LGXP descriptor and also show that our fusion approach outperforms most of the state-of-the-art approaches.", "authors": ["Shufu Xie", "Shiguang Shan", "Xilin Chen", "Jie Chen"], "n_citation": 345, "references": ["00909251-9935-44f3-94a1-629023b5015b", "17373dba-934f-4ae0-bb50-8cc00dd7c19f", "180dea34-18e8-411d-932f-94e714651ac7", "1d0d258f-be30-4f91-8121-bf4e1cac2fc0", "1d8cc25f-da8e-47b1-aca2-35375cf52520", "1f1932fe-19f1-429e-81bf-cb2e5f2e5f05", "1f839aa1-7808-45b9-b9bd-c22f08d9a46e", "262027b0-1f01-474d-a2af-4941fd3c7ec3", "2a20eff6-27c4-402c-93b3-303e3431a9c4", "32d158dc-6f9f-426a-973b-8edc5e4c5dad", "3b3d7569-08b1-4017-9910-2a017a00e43e", "3ca4470b-361a-4623-9e3d-6efc672ff736", "3e26cbdc-4a20-438e-aac1-1bcb2205991d", "407d4ab7-729d-4848-91ea-e61a05acdba6", "47b09a19-0c16-452b-8459-4348cde02256", "4928aa7c-c5fd-465a-b46d-b35a764953e1", "494b497b-836b-445a-8bcb-095600835d89", "4e6188ab-f737-491d-afaa-33cdf55024fb", "51b20a23-0c1c-48cb-81cc-eee11ec8d184", "54a5822c-e405-44ad-84e3-cea51e7349c2", "56f4b72a-ec39-47ac-8220-899296e7fb18", "61e615e7-f78f-4f1e-b604-343ecf4b2ec9", "6fc1b3bb-f651-4783-9155-77fa9f9bc0c5", "764c68d8-b2d6-4c31-8076-88ee85d0d04f", "767319b3-1d27-402f-b411-7a158ad19ae5", "7a05e88b-0be6-4fcd-bf05-ad54dddb3d29", "86fdcad6-818f-402b-b29a-15c87d2b2bec", "8c66b643-8085-4fd3-acaa-41b228484394", "9e5d5280-5cd7-4126-91d6-fa2103e2408b", "9e919722-ef30-472e-a6b7-0bd463dffe9d", "a0289f73-c8ce-4e68-b2cb-1582d5571e04", "a10624ab-978a-4540-ae52-e3fd41c77bd3", "a1f6fc9b-b718-4c9f-93ee-ca53dcd46468", "a87e5134-ff93-484f-b13f-448f565e7fad", "bf1d8c69-aefb-4a7a-8b02-f815b754833c", "cc523eb8-a470-4bf5-a6af-0316936b5b16", "d130ecec-e5cf-4f59-b4f8-1cbda4b0c307", "d7ca43c0-959f-4602-bacc-17bf9d2f3b0d", "e2204e92-e6dc-4884-9bbc-200029491fc7", "e3a5cec9-7e82-4c14-86ab-0d95a92712a7", "e599f548-72e7-4972-a58d-ab711b96a8f9", "ea12798a-feaf-4f04-b494-7834146f613a", "f63312d9-627b-4b89-907e-0fcb80e36461"], "title": "Fusing Local Patterns of Gabor Magnitude and Phase for Face Recognition", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Image Processing", "year": 2010, "id": "d1af9e7a-47fc-4067-9822-b4759f0ed18c"}
{"abstract": "Henkin and Tarski proved that an atomic cylindric algebra in which every atom is a rectangle must be representable (as a cylindric set algebra). This theorem and its analogues for quasi-polyadic algebras with and without equality are formulated in Henkin, Monk and Tarski [13].#R##N##R##N#We introduce a natural and more general notion of rectangular density that can be applied to arbitrary cylindric and quasi-polyadic algebras, not just atomic ones. We then show that every rectangularly dense cylindric algebra is representable, and we extend this result to other classes of algebras of logic, for example quasi-polyadic algebras and substitution-cylindrification algebras with and without equality, relation algebras, and special Boolean monoids. The results of op. cit. mentioned above are special cases of our general theorems.#R##N##R##N#We point out an error in the proof of the Henkin-Monk-Tarski representation theorem for atomic, equality-free, quasi-polyadic algebras with rectangular atoms. The error consists in the implicit assumption of a property that does not, in general, hold. We then give a correct proof of their theorem.#R##N##R##N#Henkin and Tarski also introduced the notion of a rich cylindric algebra and proved in op. cit. that every rich cylindric algebra of finite dimension (or, more generally, of locally finite dimension) satisfying certain special identities is representable.#R##N##R##N#We introduce a modification of the notion of a rich algebra that, in our opinion, renders it more natural. In particular, under this modification richness becomes a density notion. Moreover, our notion of richness applies not only to algebras with equality, such as cylindric algebras, but also to algebras without equality. We show that a finite dimensional algebra is rich iff it is rectangularly dense and quasi-atomic; moreover, each of these conditions is also equivalent to a very natural condition of point density. As a consequence, every finite dimensional (or locally finite dimensional) rich algebra of logic is representable. We do not have to assume the validity of any special identities to establish this representability.

{"abstract": "Digitization may offer a means of making archival film content more accessible by allowing moving imagery to be delivered via the Internet and by CBIR-enabled mitigation of the effects of archivists' inconsistent indexing practices. This paper reports on research which sought to gain an informed view on this potential. Working in collaboration with eleven representative film collections, evidence was gathered relating to subject access facilities and to client requirements in the form of 1,270 requests. The work revealed that the formulation and satisfaction of requests for archival footage places a heavy reliance on human intellectual input for which CBIR techniques offer little prospect of being an effective substitute. The conclusion is drawn that the combination of limited CBIR functionality and lack of adherence to cataloguing standards seriously limits the Internet's potential for providing enhanced access to film and video-based cultural resources.", "authors": ["Peter G.

The algorithm, presented in more detail in other papers (and publicly available on the WWW as VF), is now discussed with reference to its computational complexity and memory requirements. The performance analysis is carried out by theoretically characterizing the matching time and the required memory in the best and worst cases. The theoretical analysis is completed by tests on a database of graphs randomly generated. The algorithm is compared with the one proposed by Ullmann (1976): experimental results confirmed the theoretical expectations, highlighting the overall efficiency of the algorithm.

{"abstract": "J.-Y. Girard's (1992) new translation from classical to constructive logic is explained. A compatible continuation-passing-style (CPS) translation is given and converted to a C-rewriting machine evaluator for control-operator programs and a set of reduction/computation rules sufficient to represent the evaluator. It is found necessary to add one reduction rule to M. Felleisen's (Ph.D. thesis, Indiana Univ., 1987) calculus (evaluation under lambda -abstraction). This reduction rule arises from a modified call-by-name CPS-translation. Turning to Girard's new classical logic LC, an intuitionistic term-extraction procedure is provided for it, producing CPS functional programs. Using the syntactic properties of this language, it is possible to give simple proofs for the evidence properties of LC. This work sheds light on the design space of CPS-translations and extends the relation between control-operator languages and classical logic. >", "authors": ["Chetan R.

{"abstract": "Software visualizations can provide a concise overview of a complex software system. Unfortunately, since software has no physical shape, there is no ``natural'' mapping of software to a two-dimensional space. As a consequence most visualizations tend to use a layout in which position and distance have no meaning, and consequently layout typical diverges from one visualization to another. We propose a consistent layout for software maps in which the position of a software artifact reflects its vocabulary, and distance corresponds to similarity of vocabulary. We use latent semantic indexing (LSI) to map software artifacts to a vector space, and then use multidimensional scaling (MDS) to map this vector space down to two dimensions.The resulting consistent layout allows us to develop a variety of thematic software maps that express very different aspects of software while making it easy to compare them. The approach is especially suitable for comparing views of evolving software, since the vocabulary of software artifacts tends to be stable over time.", "authors": ["Adrian Kuhn", "Peter Loretan", "Oscar Nierstrasz"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["165689d3-2ff4-4e5c-a6a8-3d1e0539aeb6", "17cad5cf-eeef-440f-8e49-9a202747fe7f", "1bc8b7e3-4439-4777-ba6e-fa5e7dae8f44", "239ee69e-bb56-4154-9040-202dfaa401f0", "2d3cebc6-28f3-4909-8877-2d9bafd76cf4", "30558897-30cc-4123-8d01-f4940ae5becc", "55f1814e-f986-4b2a-8f21-27a7fefb813b", "5d35609f-4bfa-4d7a-b464-6852d494bad7", "5d4f95ea-3887-4d26-b66a-ab44636a0d89", "6a4e5611-cfbd-491e-a250-be232ca2870c", "729a8357-be3c-4554-8262-bd1f5b36d326", "872adde8-b244-4600-8769-b54828b69b48", "87d1f59e-c6d3-4f66-a9d2-28e3637017e9", "91499e25-8ada-4280-8031-47db2fd3a345", "9ce8965d-d6f0-412e-ad21-4e6e8a6d09e6", "9ec61714-b54c-4645-b5cd-9bd6eae3ed01", "acb5d7a4-2cd0-4e94-9343-9b05fab2505a", "c7ac30e5-4290-41ec-ac1f-38abae7b042a", "c8eeda7d-42ba-4d21-8bd3-e818262b4c13", "d15a0bd1-c06d-4efd-b73e-7ff3c2de9367", "d511bd82-5589-41bf-893b-8292c1846722", "e5115d61-6459-4beb-88d1-603c9040c726", "ede8a6d8-dbde-4e4f-ac34-2a3076bae2f3", "f0fbe997-d73c-4d2c-b167-b27097eb2440"], "title": "Consistent Layout for Thematic Software Maps", "venue": "working conference on reverse engineering", "year": 2008, "id": "3fcce176-e390-4809-801d-a7bf52b201f8"}

{"abstract": "The rapid advances in processor, memory, and radio technology have enabled the development of distributed networks of small, inexpensive nodes that are capable of sensing, computation, and wireless communication. Sensor networks of the future are envisioned to revolutionize the paradigm of collecting and processing information in diverse environments. However, the severe energy constraints and limited computing resources of the sensors, present major challenges for such a vision to become a reality. We consider a network of energy-constrained sensors that are deployed over a region. Each sensor periodically produces information as it monitors its vicinity. The basic operation in such a network is the systematic gathering and transmission of sensed data gathering and transmission of sensed data to a base station for further processing. During data gathering, sensors have the ability to perform in-network aggregation (fusion) of data packets enroute to the base station. The lifetime of such a sensor system is the time during which we can gather information from all the sensors to the base station. A key challenge in data gathering is to maximize the system lifetime, given the energy constraints of the sensors. Given the location of sensors and the base station and the available energy at each sensor, we are interested in finding an efficient manner in which data should be collected from all the sensors and transmitted to the base station, such that the system lifetime is maximized. This is the maximum lifetime data-gathering problem. In this paper, we describe a heuristic to solve the data-gathering problem with aggregation in sensor networks.

{"abstract": "Next generation wireless systems will provide highspeed wireless connectivity and seamless mobility through the provisioning of heterogeneous wireless access. In such a heterogeneous wireless access environment, mobile users will be able to connect to multiple wireless networks (e.g., IEEE 802.16, cellular, and IEEE 802.11-based networks) operated by different service providers, simultaneously. We address the problem of competitive pricing in such a heterogeneous wireless access network. Each of the wireless access networks is assumed to support two types of connections, namely, premium and best-effort connections. For the premium connections, the price is fixed, while for the best effort connections it is dynamic and depends on the competitive or cooperative behavior of the service providers. A competitive pricing model for best-effort connections is developed based on a noncooperative game formulation. We first consider the case where the prices are offered to the users at the same time (i.e., a simultaneous-play game). Nash equilibrium is considered as the solution of this game. Afterwards, we consider the case where a service provider can offer its price before other providers. This is referred to as a leader-follower game for which Stackelberg equilibrium is considered as the solution. We also consider a cooperative pricing model which maximizes the total revenue of the service providers. A method for revenue sharing is presented for this cooperative pricing model.

The approach to classification is to measure the software system and build multivariate stochastic models for predicting high-risk system components. Experimental results obtained by classifying Ada components into two classes (is, or is not likely to generate faults during system and acceptance rest) are presented. The accuracy of the model and the insights it provides into the error-making process are evaluated. >", "authors": ["Lionel C. Briand", "V.R. Brasili", "Christopher J.

{"abstract": "Component based software development is prone to unexpected interaction faults. The goal is to test as many-potential interactions as is feasible within time and budget constraints. Two combinatorial objects, the orthogonal array and the covering array, can be used to generate test suites that provide a guarantee for coverage of all t-sets of component interactions in the case when the testing of all interactions is not possible. Methods for construction of these types of test suites have focused on two main areas. The first is finding new algebraic constructions that produce smaller test suites. The second is refining computational search algorithms to find smaller test suites more quickly. In this paper we explore one method for constructing covering arrays of strength three that combines algebraic constructions with computational search. This method leverages the computational efficiency and optimality of size obtained through algebraic constructions while benefiting from the generality of a heuristic search. We present a few examples of specific constructions and provide some new bounds for some strength three covering arrays.", "authors": ["Myra B. Cohen", "Charles J. Colbourn", "Alan C. H.

{"abstract": "Background#R##N#Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) have gained significant popularity among Software Engineering (SE) researchers since 2004. Several researchers have also been working on improving the scientific and methodological infrastructure to support SLRs in SE. We argue that there is also an apparent and essential need for evidence-based body of knowledge about different aspects of the adoption of SLRs in SE.#R##N#Objective#R##N#The main objective of this research is to empirically investigate the adoption, value, and use of SLRs in SE research from various perspectives.#R##N#Method#R##N#We used mixed-methods approach (systematically integrating tertiary literature review, semi-structured interviews and questionnaire-based survey) as it is based on a combination of complementary research methods which are expected to compensate each others\u2019 limitations.#R##N#Results#R##N#A large majority of the participants are convinced of the value of using a rigourous and systematic methodology for literature reviews in SE research. However, there are concerns about the required time and resources for SLRs. One of the most important motivators for performing SLRs is new findings and inception of innovative ideas for further research. The reported SLRs are more influential compared to the traditional literature reviews in terms of number of citations. One of the main challenges of conducting SLRs is drawing a balance between methodological rigour and required effort.#R##N#Conclusions#R##N#SLR has become a popular research methodology for conducting literature review and evidence aggregation in SE. There is an overall positive perception about this relatively new methodology to SE research. The findings provide interesting insights into different aspects of SLRs.

{"abstract": "Let /spl chi//sub n/=(x/sub 1/,...,x/sub n/), be an independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) sample having multivariate distribution P. We derive almost sure (a.s.) limits for the power-weighted edge weight function of greedy approximations to a class of minimal graphs spanning k of the n samples. The class includes minimal k-point graphs constructed by the partitioning method of Ravi, Sundaram, Marathe, Rosenkrantz, and Ravi (see Proc. 5th Annu. ACM-SIAM Symp. Discrete Algorithms, Arlington, VA, p.546-55, 1994), where the edge weight function satisfies the quasi-additive property of Redmond and Yukich (see Ann. Appl. Probab., vol.4, no.4, p.1057-73, 1994). In particular, this includes greedy approximations to the k-point minimal spanning tree (k-MST), Steiner tree (k-ST), and the traveling salesman problem (k-TSP). An expression for the influence function of the minimal-weight function is given which characterizes the asymptotic sensitivity of the graph weight to perturbations in the underlying distribution. The influence function takes a form which indicates that the k-point minimal graph in d>1 dimensions has robustness properties in R/sup d/ which are analogous to those of rank-order statistics in one dimension. A direct result of our theory is that the log-weight of the k-point minimal graph is a consistent nonparametric estimate of the Renyi entropy of the distribution P.

{"abstract": "Localization in unknown environments using low-cost sensors on embedded hardware is challenging. Yet, it is a requirement for consumer robots if systematic navigation is desired. In this paper, we present a localization approach that learns the spatial variation of an observed continuous signal over the environment. We model the signal as a piecewise linear function and estimate its parameters using a simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) approach. By applying the concepts of the exactly sparse extended information filter (ESEIF) , a constant-time, linear-space algorithm is obtained under certain approximations. We apply our framework to a sensor measuring bearing to active beacons, where measurements are distorted because of occlusion and signal reflections. Experimental results from running GraphSLAM, extended Kalman filter SLAM, and ESEIF-SLAM on manually collected sensor measurements, as well as on data recorded on a vacuum-cleaner robot, validate our model. The ESEIF-SLAM solution is evaluated on an ARM 7 embedded board with 64-kB RAM connected to a Roomba 510 vacuum cleaner.

{"abstract": "Over the past decade, crowdsourcing has emerged as a cheap and efficient method of obtaining solutions to simple tasks that are difficult for computers to solve but possible for humans. The popularity and promise of crowdsourcing markets has led to both empirical and theoretical research on the design of algorithms to optimize various aspects of these markets, such as the pricing and assignment of tasks. Much of the existing theoretical work on crowdsourcing markets has focused on problems that fall into the broad category of online decision making; task requesters or the crowdsourcing platform itself make repeated decisions about prices to set, workers to filter out, problems to assign to specific workers, or other things. Often these decisions are complex, requiring algorithms that learn about the distribution of available tasks or workers over time and take into account the strategic (or sometimes irrational) behavior of workers.   As human computation grows into its own field, the time is ripe to address these challenges in a principled way.

{"abstract": "We present a novel approach to the problem of navigating through a database of color images for the purpose of image retrieval. We endow the database with a metric for the color distributions of the images. We then use multi-dimensional scaling techniques to embed a group of images as points in a two-dimensional Euclidean space so that their distances reflect image dissimilarities as well as possible. Such geometric embeddings allow the user to perceive the dominant axes of variation in the displayed image group, and form a mental picture of the database contents. Furthermore, since these embeddings group similar images together, away from dissimilar ones, the user can refine the query in a perceptually intuitive way. By iterating this process, the user can quickly navigate to the portion of the image space of interest.", "authors": ["Yossi Rubner", "Carlo Tomasi", "Leonidas J.

{"abstract": "In the present paper we introduce a visual query language, Phenomena, able to manage continuous fields, which represent real-world events. In GIS applications, continuous fields represent phenomena related to the environment and its resources. Recently, much attention has been devoted to the field view of geographic phenomena, where the geographic world can be described by a number of variables, each measurable at any point. While objects are distinguished by their dimensions, and can be associated with points, lines, or areas, fields can be distinguished by what varies, and how smoothly. Thus, when dealing with continuous fields, a basic requirement is represented by users' capability to capture some features of a scenario, by selecting an area of interest and handling the heterogeneous events involved. Phenomena makes this task easy to implement, thanks to a quite intuitive visual representation of both continuous fields and conditions, which involve them. A peculiar feature of the visual language is the use of geometries to select portions of continuous fields, on the basis of spatial conditions. The heterogeneous nature of fields and objects is also reflected in the visualization of query results.", "authors": ["Luca Paolino", "Genoveffa Tortora", "Monica Sebillo", "Giuliana Vitiello", "Robert Laurini"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["08044a75-4c53-428d-9f0f-3b37b174d943", "8c38d0e7-dc3d-46a1-a188-a511ac1d4faa", "9bc45744-7779-4f41-b79f-10e784f1388e", "c3b4ffe0-c8b4-4ce6-9e09-60d0f9eaaffc", "dc98e030-3a81-42c3-b3b8-2bd7094a1888", "e946068a-71af-4683-a807-dea8ff890935", "f9c8c142-e10c-4722-bf2c-0095d29c4d9e"], "title": "Phenomena: a visual query language for continuous fields", "venue": "advances in geographic information systems", "year": 2003, "id": "de120546-fc62-4f29-812e-2307fd1124d0"}
{"abstract": "It is shown that (pre)asymptotic stability, which generalizes asymptotic stability, of a compact set for a hybrid system satisfying mild regularity assumptions is equivalent to the existence of a smooth Lyapunov function. This result is achieved with the intermediate result that asymptotic stability of a compact set for a hybrid system is generically robust to small, state-dependent perturbations. As a special case, we state a converse Lyapunov theorem for systems with logic variables and use this result to establish input-to-state stabilization using hybrid feedback control. The converse Lyapunov theorems are also used to establish semiglobal practical robustness to slowly varying, weakly jumping parameters, to temporal regularization, to the insertion of jumps according to an ldquoaverage dwell-timerdquo rule, and to the insertion of flow according to a ldquoreverse average dwell-timerdquo rule.", "authors": ["Chaohong Cai", "Rafal Goebel"], "n_citation": 156, "references": ["37971b99-f57d-421b-9f27-1a8b6dae2245", "5990f2ae-f113-4ea2-930a-b35bdde8a3eb", "7044c72d-bebe-42eb-b38b-227b414fecf9", "9b3ec216-e8f5-41b1-8eb2-470bcfe5d6d2", "9d7805c3-36dc-4545-a07c-dcc180030b66", "abc67c89-a100-4635-becb-b771cb95be1d", "de6e710b-7df5-484b-9bc8-a79993fe4451", "f0fe0ee0-b57e-47ab-8a00-dee7f1a9bc44"], "title": "Smooth Lyapunov Functions for Hybrid Systems Part II: (Pre)Asymptotically Stable Compact Sets", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "year": 2008, "id": "722523ab-7af7-4d12-b188-146293a67fce"}
{"abstract": "Neural networks, despite their empirically proven abilities, have been little used for the refinement of existing knowledge because this task requires a three-step process. First, knowledge must be inserted into a neural network. Second, the network must be refined. Third, the refined knowledge must be extracted from the network. We have previously described a method for the first step of this process. Standard neural learning techniques can accomplish the second step. In this article, we propose and empirically evaluate a method for the final, and possibly most difficult, step. Our method efficiently extracts symbolic rules from trained neural networks. The four major results of empirical tests of this method are that the extracted rules 1) closely reproduce the accuracy of the network from which they are extracteds 2) are superior to the rules produced by methods that directly refine symbolic ruless 3) are superior to those produced by previous techniques for extracting rules from trained neural networkss and 4) are \u201chuman comprehensible.\u201d Thus, this method demonstrates that neural networks can be used to effectively refine symbolic knowledge.

Each router maintains entries only for those destinations for which data flows through the router which reduces storage space requirements and the amount of bandwidth needed to maintain correct routing tables. In ROAM, routes are established and maintained on demand using diffusing computations. A router does not send updates for active destinations, unless its distance to them increases beyond a given threshold. ROAM maintains a state that informs routers when a destination is unreachable and prevents routers from sending unnecessary search packets attempting to find paths to an unreachable destination.

{"abstract": "Partial-evaluation folklore has it that massaging one's source programs can make them specialize better. In Jones, Gomard, and Sestoft's recent textbook, a whole chapter is dedicated to listing such \u201cbinding-time improvements\u201d: nonstandard use of continuation-passing style, eta-expansion, and a popular transformation called \u201cThe Trick.\u201d We provide a unified view of these binding-time improvements, from a typing perspective. Just as a proper treatment of product values in partial evaluation requires partially static values, a proper treatment of disjoint sums requires moving static contexts across dynamic case expressions. This requirement precisely accounts for the nonstandard use of continuation-passing style encountered in partial evaluation.

{"abstract": "Recent research shows that 20%-30% of building energy consumption can be saved through optimized operation and management without changing the building structure and the hardware configuration of the energy supply system. Therefore, there is a huge potential for building energy savings through efficient operation. Microgrid technology provides an opportunity and a desirable infrastructure for improving the efficiency of energy consumption in buildings. The key to improve building energy efficiency in operation is to coordinate and optimize the operation of various energy sources and loads. In this paper, the scheduling problem of building energy supplies is considered with the practical background of a low energy building. The objective function is to minimize the overall cost of electricity and natural gas for a building operation over a time horizon while satisfying the energy balance and complicated operating constraints of individual energy supply equipment and devices. The uncertainties are captured and their impact is analyzed by the scenario tree method. Numerical testing is performed with the data of the pilot low energy building. The testing results show that significant energy cost savings can be achieved through integrated scheduling and control of various building energy supply sources. It is very important to fully utilize solar energy and optimize the operation of electrical storage. It is also shown that precooling is a simple way to achieve energy savings.", "authors": ["Xiaohong Guan", "Zhanbo Xu", "Qing-Shan Jia"], "n_citation": 301, "references": ["470f1acf-de69-45a8-a8e6-86ac3058d287", "89d2797d-62a4-4f42-af74-cdb5951e3f9e"], "title": "Energy-Efficient Buildings Facilitated by Microgrid", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid", "year": 2010, "id": "dfbccce3-46cf-433c-b061-ce6f161a915a"}

Given the requirements for provision of service despite faults, early detection of system states that can potentially lead to system failure is valuable. We address the issue of ascertaining whether  localized  EAs in individual modules add up complementarily to implement a  global  EA/property. We first show that detection of globally compliant EAs is NP-complete. Thus, we develop a two-pass approach for our objective. In the first pass, we introduce the  consistency  property of EAs and use it to ascertain global conformity across all EAs. The second pass, analogous to predicate transformers, generates globally consistent EAs when any inconsistency is flagged in the first pass. We show the applicability of our approach on a real embedded system. Initial results obtained show that our framework is able to detect inherent vulnerabilities (due to placement of mismatched EAs) that were previously undetected.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel approach of translating natural languages specification to SBVR business rules. The business rules constraint business structure or control behaviour of a business process. In modern business modelling, one of the important phases is writing business rules. Typically, a business rule analyst has to manually write hundreds of business rules in a natural language (NL) and then manually translate NL specification of all the rules in a particular rule language such as SBVR, or OCL, as required. However, the manual translation of NL rule specification to formal representation as SBVR rule is not only difficult, complex and time consuming but also can result in erroneous business rules. In this paper, we propose an automated approach that automatically translates the NL (such as English) specification of business rules to SBVR (Semantic Business Vocabulary and Rules) rules. The major challenge in NL to SBVR translation was complex semantic analysis of English language. We have used a rule based algorithm for robust semantic analysis of English and generate SBVR rules. Automated generation of SBVR based Business rules can help in improved and efficient constrained business aspects in a typical business modelling.", "authors": ["Imran Sarwar Bajwa", "Mark G.

{"abstract": "We propose an accurate collision detection algorithm for use in virtual reality applications. The algorithm works for three-dimensional graphical environments where multiple objects, represented as polyhedra (boundary representation), are undergoing arbitrary motion (translation and rotation). The algorithm can be used directly for both convex and concave objects and objects can be deformed (non-rigid) during motion. The algorithm works efficiently by first reducing the number of face pairs that need to be checked accurately for interference by first localizing possible collision regions using bounding box and spatial subdivision techniques; face pairs that remain after this pruning stage are then accurately checked for interference. The algorithm is efficient, simple to implement, and does not require any memory intensive auxiliary data structures to be precomputed and updated. Since polyhedral shape representation is one of the most common shape representation schemes, this algorithm should be useful to a wide audience.

{"abstract": "Repolarization alternans or T-wave alternans (TWA) is a subject of great interest as it has been shown as a risk stratifier for sudden cardiac death. As TWA consists of subtle and nonvisible variations of the ST-T complex, its detection may become more difficult in noisy environments, such as stress testing or Holter recordings. In this paper, a technique based on the empirical-mode decomposition (EMD) to separate the useful information of the ST-T complex from noise and artifacts is proposed. The identification of the useful part of the signal is based on the study of complexity in the EMD domain by means of the Hjorth descriptors. As a result, a robust technique to extract the trend of the ST-T complex has been achieved. The evaluation of the method is carried out with the spectral method (SM) over several public domain databases with ECGs sampled at different frequencies. The results show that the SM with the proposed technique outperforms the traditional SM by more than 2 dB. Also, the robustness of this technique is guaranteed as it does not introduce any additional distortion to the detector in noiseless conditions.", "authors": ["Manuel Blanco-Velasco", "Fernando Cruz-Rold\u00e1n", "Juan Ignacio Godino-Llorente", "Kenneth E.

{"abstract": "In this paper we perform a detailed analysis of point-to-point packet delay in an operational tier-1 network. The point-to-point delay is the time between a packet entering a router in one PoP (an ingress point) and its leaving a router in another PoP (an egress point). It measures the one-way delay experienced by packets from an ingress point to an egress point across an ISP's network and provides the most basic information regarding the delay performance of the ISP's network. Using packet traces captured in the operational network, we obtain precise point-to-point packet delay measurements and analyze the various factors affecting them. Through a simple, step-by-step, systematic methodology and careful data analysis, we identify the major network factors that contribute to point-to-point packet delay and characterize their effect on the network delay performance. Our findings are: 1) delay distributions vary greatly in shape, depending on the path and link utilization; 2) after constant factors dependent only on the path and packet size are removed, the 99th percentile variable delay remains under 1 ms over several hops and under link utilization below 90% on a bottleneck; 3) a very small number of packets experience very large delay in short bursts", "authors": ["Baek-Young Choi", "Sue B.

{"abstract": "Quite often failures in network based services and server systems may not be accidental, but rather caused by deliberate security intrusions. We would like such systems to either completely preclude the possibility of a security intrusion or design them to be robust enough to continue functioning despite security attacks. Not only is it important to prevent or tolerate security intrusions, it is equally important to treat security as a QoS attribute at par with, if not more important than other QoS attributes such as availability and performability. This paper deals with various issues related to quantifying the security attribute of an intrusion tolerant system, such as the SITAR system. A security intrusion and the response of an intrusion tolerant system to the attack is modeled as a random process. This facilitates the use of stochastic modeling techniques to capture the attacker behavior as well as the system's response to a security intrusion. This model is used to analyze and quantify the security attributes of the system. The security quantification analysis is first carried out for steady-state behavior leading to measures like steady-state availability. By transforming this model to a model with absorbing states, we compute a security measure called the \"mean time (or effort) to security failure\" and also compute probabilities of security failure due to violations of different security attributes.", "authors": ["Bharat B.

{"abstract": "Agile Software Development methodologies have grown in popularity both among academic researchers and industrial practitioners. Among the various methodologies or practices proposed, pair programming, which is concerned with two programmers collaborating on design, coding and testing, has become a controversial focus of interest. Even though some success stories have been reported with the use of pair-programming in real software development environment, many people remain rather skeptical of the claims on pair-programming productivity. Previous studies in pair programming have only addressed the basic understanding of the productivity of pairs and they have not addressed the variation in productivity between pairs of varying skills and experience, such as between novice-novice and expert-expert. Statistical productivity measurements reported by different researchers also seem to lead to contradictory conclusions. Until now, the literature has not addressed how those results and experiments were related to each other. In this paper, we propose a controlled experiment called repeat-programming which can facilitate the understanding of relationships between human experience and programming productivity. Repeat-programming can be performed when controversial issues in non-traditional programming methodologies and development productivity need to be investigated into. To illustrate how the proposed empirical experiment can put arguable, divisive problems into perspective, we have examined the productivity in pair programming as a case study. With repeat-programming, we are able to (i) better understand why results of previous pair programming control experiments reached different conclusions as to the productivity of pair programming and (ii) most importantly, present a case in which novice-novice pairs against novice solos are much more productive than expert-expert pairs against expert solos.", "authors": ["Kim Man Lui", "Keith C.

{"abstract": "We present new fingerprint classification algorithms based on two machine learning approaches: support vector machines (SVMs) and recursive neural networks (RNNs). RNNs are trained on a structured representation of the fingerprint image. They are also used to extract a set of distributed features of the fingerprint which can be integrated in the SVM. SVMs are combined with a new error-correcting code scheme. This approach has two main advantages: (a) It can tolerate the presence of ambiguous fingerprint images in the training set and (b) it can effectively identify the most difficult fingerprint images in the test set. By rejecting these images the accuracy of the system improves significantly. We report experiments on the fingerprint database NIST-4. Our best classification accuracy is of 95.6 percent at 20 percent rejection rate and is obtained by training SVMs on both FingerCode and RNN-extracted features. This result indicates the benefit of integrating global and structured representations and suggests that SVMs are a promising approach for fingerprint classification.", "authors": ["Yuan Yao", "Gian Luca Marcialis", "Massimiliano Pontil", "Paolo Frasconi", "Fabio Roli"], "n_citation": 129, "references": ["1035d56c-06b3-40bb-93c7-6306b24bac93", "12fa9885-b0a9-4ea3-a0de-e020c333c3f0", "2846261e-eab1-422c-ace5-95538b9c57c8", "31b724c0-ae79-4477-ab75-3b62e2133bdb", "3246059e-cd3b-4d95-8ca9-59f2238c6bb4", "44ba65c5-2347-4956-871b-29c73c4a33b9", "61ba385a-b0cb-4da6-9ca3-89349fc0f709", "64e451a9-c061-47bb-8e84-8c1f2de25a20", "6b962f02-f97d-49a6-8c2c-7e751a2e03a9", "6fc6dec0-2b8c-4cb6-a6b5-773534b85711", "8b1cbeaa-982d-4a9f-86ec-d87646ca847b", "91979159-37d8-410f-a245-a33ef80a092b", "b8bdbda7-80f4-47ce-9564-88cb58f87de2", "cdbd2ef9-d4b1-4dff-9037-3ea84627424d", "cdf60c4f-1a1c-4587-b241-cae92580e667", "d7527f07-c78b-4a67-8ee7-688fc9e51068", "ed3e89f3-8dfd-4e37-b719-48185570f487", "f00fc370-0854-4967-bc6a-83b6c49da8bf"], "title": "Combining flat and structured representations for fingerprint classification with recursive neural networks and support vector machines", "venue": "Pattern Recognition", "year": 2003, "id": "dd846139-927a-48f9-9941-754704ebb753"}

{"abstract": "This paper is concerned with the study of, both local and global, uniform asymptotic stability for general nonlinear and time-varying switched systems. Two concepts of Lyapunov functions are introduced and used to establish uniform Lyapunov stability and uniform global stability. With the help of output functions, an almost bounded output energy condition and an output persistent excitation condition are then proposed and employed to guarantee uniform local and global asymptotic stability. Based on this result, a generalized version of Krasovskii-LaSalle theorem in time-varying switched systems is proposed. For switched systems with persistent dwell-time, the output persistent excitation condition is guaranteed to hold under a zero-state observability condition. It is shown that several existing results in past literature can be covered as special cases using the proposed criteria. Interestingly, as opposed to previous work, the main results of this paper are applicable to the situation where some switching systems are not asymptotically stable at the origin. The robust practical regulation problem of nonholonomic mobile robots is studied as a way of demonstrating the power of the proposed new criteria. A novel switching controller is proposed with guaranteed robustness to orientation error and unknown parameters in mobile robots.", "authors": ["Ti Chaung Lee", "Zhong-Ping Jiang"], "n_citation": 112, "references": ["362602ba-aa06-4ae4-9698-5b591820b9a1", "376eb1b2-7dca-4716-9444-2ef598532bbb", "3793e29b-85b6-4879-9fc4-c677b492b9f7", "37971b99-f57d-421b-9f27-1a8b6dae2245", "3a0b266a-9d3a-4f6f-a6bb-9e78bb183bc0", "3f92db6f-2ebe-43ee-9ab3-971ecf2ac946", "4cc812e1-1135-4d09-b563-f6cd81763271", "5bee5632-d5ee-4032-bb79-78cefa736a7b", "7044c72d-bebe-42eb-b38b-227b414fecf9", "93135584-ab8f-4f79-b842-063b6589cbaa", "9daee039-2b65-454e-8d0a-7e09b99994ea", "b69440f7-7c5f-4e01-ac80-abce3d60ab94", "b73357c8-9427-4cf0-b32f-c0b4f32cad29", "b8128128-4eb7-4782-a278-9925ccb0f97e", "ced8a2a3-408a-4b76-a8af-446b17bc74dc", "d51c460e-e9f2-4bd2-9d08-6e4937c40d82", "e0dbcf56-cabd-4b2c-8d4e-839f0212db3f", "ef90d243-afa7-402c-9698-1771550d81f2"], "title": "Uniform Asymptotic Stability of Nonlinear Switched Systems With an Application to Mobile Robots", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "year": 2008, "id": "570a7e91-b353-44c2-ba5a-49c8e9a182df"}

{"abstract": "Addressing user's information needs has been one of the main goals of Web search engines since their early days. In some cases, users cannot see their needs immediately answered by search results, simply because these needs are too complex and involve multiple aspects that are not covered by a single Web or search results page. This typically happens when users investigate a certain topic in domains such as education, travel or health, which often require collecting facts and information from many pages. We refer to this type of activities as \"research missions\". These research missions account for 10% of users' sessions and more than 25% of all query volume, as verified by a manual analysis that was conducted by Yahoo! editors.   We demonstrate in this paper that such missions can be automatically identified on-the-fly, as the user interacts with the search engine, through careful runtime analysis of query flows and query sessions.   The on-the-fly automatic identification of research missions has been implemented in Search Pad, a novel Yahoo! application that was launched in 2009, and that we present in this paper. Search Pad helps users keeping trace of results they have consulted. Its novelty however is that unlike previous notes taking products, it is automatically triggered only when the system decides, with a fair level of confidence, that the user is undertaking a research mission and thus is in the right context for gathering notes. Beyond the Search Pad specific application, we believe that changing the level of granularity of query modeling, from an isolated query to a list of queries pertaining to the same research missions, so as to better reflect a certain type of information needs, can be beneficial in a number of other Web search applications.

{"abstract": "We study an online unit-job scheduling problem arising in buffer management. Each job is specified by its release time, deadline, and a nonnegative weight. Due to overloading conditions, some jobs have to be dropped. The goal is to maximize the total weight of scheduled jobs. We present several competitive online algorithms for various versions of unit-job scheduling, as well as some lower bounds on the competitive ratios. We first give a randomized algorithm RMix with competitive ratio of e/(e-1)~1.582. This is the first algorithm for this problem with competitive ratio smaller than 2. Then we consider s-bounded instances, where the span of each job (deadline minus release time) is at most s. We give a 1.25-competitive randomized algorithm for 2-bounded instances, matching the known lower bound. We also give a deterministic algorithm Edf\"@a, whose competitive ratio on s-bounded instances is 2-2/s+o(1/s). For 3-bounded instances its ratio is @f~1.618, matching the known lower bound. In s-uniform instances, the span of each job is exactly s. We show that no randomized algorithm can be better than 1.25-competitive on s-uniform instances, if the span s is unbounded. For s=2, our proof gives a lower bound of 4-22~1.172. Also, in the 2-uniform case, we prove a lower bound of 2~1.414 for deterministic memoryless algorithms, matching a known upper bound. Finally, we investigate the multiprocessor case and give a 1/(1-(mm+1)^m)-competitive algorithm for m processors.

We continue our work in the TREC 2 environment, performing both routing and ad-hoc experiments. The ad-hoc work extends our investigations into combining global similarities, giving an overall indication of how a document matches a query, with local similarities identifying a smaller part of the document that matches the query. The performance of the ad-hoc runs is good, but it is clear we are not yet taking full advantage of the available local information. Our routing experiments use conventional relevance feedback approaches to routing, but with a much greater degree of query expansion than was previously done. The length of a query vector is increased by a factor of 5 to 10 by adding terms found in previously seen relevant documents.

In contrast to many other genetic algorithm-based approaches that use domain-specific knowledge, the approach presented in this paper relies on a graded penalty term component of the fitness function to penalize infeasible solutions. The method is applied to several large problem instances of the maximum independent set problem. The results clearly indicate that genetic algorithms can be successfully used as heuristics for finding good approximative solutions for this highly constrained optimization problem. >", "authors": ["Thomas G.

{"abstract": "Some works are reported in the frequency domain watermarking using Single Value Decomposition (SVD). The two most commonly used methods are based on DCT-SVD and DWT-SVD. The commonly present disadvantages in traditional watermarking techniques such as inability to withstand attacks are absent in SVD based algorithms. They offer a robust method of watermarking with minimum or no distortion. DCT based watermarking techniques offer compression while DWT based compression offer scalability. Thus all the three desirable properties can be utilized to create a new robust watermarking technique. In this paper, we propose a method of non-blind transform domain watermarking based on DWT-DCT-SVD. The DCT coefficients of the DWT coefficients are used to embed the watermarking information. This method of watermarking is found to be robust and the visual watermark is recoverable without only reasonable amount of distortion even in the case of attacks. Thus the method can be used to embed copyright information in the form of a visual watermark or simple text.", "authors": ["K. A. Navas", "Mathews Cheriyan Ajay", "M. Lekshmi", "Tampy S.

Maxsum allocations can also be found under alternative notions such as equitability. In this paper, we examine the properties of these allocations. In particular, we provide conditions for when maxsum envy-free or equitable allocations are Pareto optimal and give examples where fairness with Pareto optimality is not possible. We also prove that maxsum envy-free allocations have weakly greater welfare than maxsum equitable allocations when agents have structured valuations, and we derive an approximate version of this inequality for general valuations.", "authors": ["Steven J.

{"abstract": "A neural network approach is proposed to build the first stage of an automatic handwritten signature verification system that will eliminate random and simple forgeries rapidly. The directional probability density function was used as a global shape factor, and its discriminatory power was enhanced by reducing its cardinality. The choice of the best pretreatment was made by means of a k nearest neighbour classifier. This study has shown that the cardinality of the PDF can be reduced by a factor of ten while doubling its discriminatory power. The backpropagation model was retained to build the neural network classifier. An experimental protocol was used to find the best configuration of the BPN classifier whose performance was compared on the same database and with the same decision rule (without rejection criteria), to those of the kNN and threshold classifiers. This comparison shows that the BPN classifier is clearly better than the T classifier, and compares favourably with the kNN classifier.", "authors": ["Jean-Pierre Drouhard", "Robert Sabourin", "Mario Godbout"], "n_citation": 50, "references": [], "title": "A comparative study of the k nearest neighbour, threshold and neural network classifiers for handwritten signature verification using an enhanced directional PDF", "venue": "international conference on document analysis and recognition", "year": 1995, "id": "a9cbbe65-add4-4b6f-b346-36db6a170ce6"}

{"abstract": "Dynamic algebras combine the classes of Boolean (B \u2228 \u2032 0) and regular (R \u222a; *) algebras into a single finitely axiomatized variety (B R \u25ca) resembling an R-module with \u201cscalar\u201d multiplication \u25ca. The basic result is that * is reflexive transitive closure, contrary to the intuition that this concept should require quantifiers for its definition. Using this result we give several examples of dynamic algebras arising naturally in connection with additive functions, binary relations, state trajectories, languages, and flowcharts. The main result is that free dynamic algebras are residually finite (i.e. factor as a subdirect product of finite dynamic algebras), important because finite separable dynamic algebras are isomorphic to Kripke structures.

{"abstract": "With the increasing use of various Web-based services, design of high performance, scalable and dependable data centers has become a critical issue. Recent studies show that a clustered, multi-tier architecture is a cost-effective approach to design such servers. Since these servers are highly distributed and complex, understanding the workloads driving them is crucial for the success of the ongoing research to improve them. In view of this, there has been a significant amount of work to characterize the workloads of Web-based services. However, all of the previous studies focus on a high level view of these servers, and analyze request-based or session-based characteristics of the workloads. In this paper, we focus on the characteristics of the network behavior within a clustered, multi-tiered data center. Using a real implementation of a clustered three-tier data center, we analyze the arrival rate and inter-arrival time distribution of the requests to individual server nodes, the network traffic between tiers, and the average size of messages exchanged between tiers. The main results of this study are; (1) in most cases, the request inter-arrival rates follow log-normal distribution, and self-similarity exists when the data center is heavily loaded, (2) message sizes can be modeled by the log-normal distribution, and (3) service times fit reasonably well with the Pareto distribution and show heavy tailed behavior at heavy loads.", "authors": ["Deniz Ersoz", "Mazin S.

{"abstract": "Steerable displays  use a motorized platform to orient a projector to display graphics at any point in the room. Often a camera is included to recognize markers and other objects, as well as user gestures in the display volume. Such systems can be used to superimpose graphics onto the real world, and so are useful in a number of augmented reality and ubiquitous computing scenarios. We contribute the Beamatron, which advances steerable displays by drawing on recent progress in depth camera-based interactions. The Beamatron consists of a computer-controlled pan and tilt platform on which is mounted a projector and Microsoft Kinect sensor. While much previous work with steerable displays deals primarily with projecting corrected graphics onto a discrete set of static planes, we describe computational techniques that enable reasoning in 3D using live depth data. We show two example applications that are enabled by the unique capabilities of the Beamatron: an augmented reality game in which a player can drive a virtual toy car around a room, and a ubiquitous computing demo that uses speech and gesture to move projected graphics throughout the room.", "authors": ["Andrew D.

{"abstract": "In this paper we investigate the effects of replacing the objective function of a 0-1 mixed-integer convex program (MIP) with a \"proximity\" one, with the aim of using a black-box solver as a refinement heuristic. Our starting observation is that enumerative MIP methods naturally tend to explore a neighborhood around the solution of a relaxation. A better heuristic performance can however be expected by searching a neighborhood of an integer solution--a result that we obtain by just modifying the objective function of the problem at hand. The relationship of this approach with primal integer methods is also addressed. Promising computational results on different proof-of-concept implementations are presented, suggesting that proximity search can be quite effective in quickly refining a given feasible solution. This is particularly true when a sequence of similar MIPs has to be solved as, e.g., in a column-generation setting.", "authors": ["Matteo Fischetti", "Michele Monaci"], "n_citation": 47, "references": ["07e905c2-55d9-4b02-9748-147a4e44500e", "3efb0b5e-cede-4bcc-8256-15fad1f8f7f1", "4f1a5305-2785-4198-aca7-54a75fc3a334", "4f756989-5102-4557-bc97-e1a39e3acc3a", "57243e5a-adf8-4224-b346-3dd40bcbfd2c", "61bb05d1-fa03-4bc7-89c3-0e967029168e", "68e47974-7dc7-4301-b3a8-c8365671a248", "862406b8-0807-423e-9985-d94d076ed17d", "89f8d830-b731-4b93-8c5a-48856a4cb823", "a8d9d18a-d1d8-4bdf-b29e-a4606d72944c", "d0c0ae6e-d919-41d1-8db9-b9c065cb93b3", "d98e3082-79bd-479b-9657-801cfb2793ea", "dbdee23e-dcef-410d-b69a-0953da0f6bd5", "e3ea40fa-9f8e-4dca-b928-76577f86dc07", "eeb50273-c276-4034-97ef-feefcd988b2a", "ffc05425-16e0-4f35-ac80-5db9ff673db7"], "title": "Proximity search for 0-1 mixed-integer convex programming", "venue": "Journal of Heuristics", "year": 2014, "id": "14b692f7-9a10-4cfd-8445-60143985aa5a"}
{"abstract": "Handling aspects within models looks promising for managing crosscutting concerns early in the software life-cycle, up from programming to design, analysis and even requirements. At the modeling level, even complex behavioral aspects can easily be described for instance as pairs of sequence diagrams: one for the pointcut specifying the behavior to detect, and the second one for an advice representing the wanted behavior at the join point. While this is fine for informal documentation purposes, or even intuitive enough when a single aspect has to be woven, a more precise semantics of both join point detection and advice weaving is needed for using these modeling artifacts for Model Driven Engineering activities such as code generation or test synthesis. This paper proposes various interpretations for pointcuts that allow multiple behavioral aspects to be statically woven. The idea is to allow join points to match a pointcut even when some extra-messages occur in between. However, with this new way of specifying join points, the composition of the advice with the detected part cannot any longer be just a replacement of the detected part by the advice. We have to consider the events (or the messages) of the join point, but also the events which occur between them, and merge them with the behavior specified within the advice. We thus also propose a formal definition of a new merge operator, and describe its implementation on the Kermeta platform.", "authors": ["Jacques Klein", "Franck Fleurey", "Jean-Marc J\u00e9z\u00e9quel"], "n_citation": 84, "references": ["05c211d9-287e-4baf-bd61-d16301b2cda3", "079448f1-6b1a-4086-81b5-382563be3103", "11f5ba09-9594-4019-92e6-17a56e2fb20e", "1d53ea02-d6b1-4629-88fe-d753b9c29e29", "33e65595-28a8-45c1-807c-aa9167f1a4e4", "375570ce-5e41-4e39-9dff-a85f9f629e57", "3a00ef5f-3225-4e27-9c3d-507de55b55f8", "419af669-5c37-4931-b118-938512f6c78d", "4e4fc749-91b7-4310-8781-cad39ab68e4e", "4ee0a2cd-84f3-4d28-a567-f8c814cd5fcc", "67c8705d-adfd-45f5-9e5a-20923dd34d82", "800495a4-85fb-45f9-97ba-ce4b1b6b17ef", "935dea53-02d0-4651-8899-26516105de3d", "ed85f4da-e0ec-4399-a7ab-2b20d6a2319d", "f694e926-1805-4325-8003-2ec6d35585a6"], "title": "Weaving multiple aspects in sequence diagrams", "venue": "aspect oriented software development", "year": 2007, "id": "b6ed122b-2b3b-4314-92f0-5cba9be12acc"}

According to the wavelength conflict rule, we know that the number of wavelengths required in a WDM network is at least equal to the maximal number of channels over a fiber (called maximal link load) in the network. By placing wavelength converters at some nodes in the network, the number of wavelengths needed can be made equal to the maximal link load. In this paper, we study the problem of placing the minimal number of converters in a network to achieve that the number of wavelengths in use is equal to the maximal link load.

{"abstract": "The classical surface curvature measures, such as the Gaussian and the mean curvature at a point of a surface, are not very indicative of local shape. The two principal curvatures (taken as a pair) are more informative, but one would prefer a single shape indicator rather than a pair of numbers. Moreover, the shape indicator should preferably be independent of the size i.e. the amount of curvature, as distinct from the type of curvature. We propose two novel measures of local shape, the \u2018curvedness\u2019 and the \u2018shape index\u2019. The curvedness is a positive number that specifies the amount of curvature, whereas the shape index is a number in the range [\u22121, +1] and is scale invariant. The shape index captures the intuitive notion of \u2018local shape\u2019 particularly well. The shape index can be mapped upon an intuitively natural colour scale. Two complementary shapes (like stamp and mould) map to complementary hues. The symmetrical saddle (which is very special because it is self-complementary) maps to white. When a surface is tinted according to this colour scheme, this induces an immediate perceptual segmentation of convex, concave, and hyperbolic areas. We propose it as a useful tool in graphics representation of 3D shape.", "authors": ["Jan J.

These capabilities are ideally suited for disaster response because the snake robot can thread through tightly packed volumes, accessing locations that people and conventional machinery otherwise cannot. Snake robots also have the advantage of possessing a variety of locomotion capabilities that conventional robots do not. Just like their biological counterparts, snake robots achieve these locomotion capabilities using cyclic motions called gaits. These cyclic motions directly control the snake robot's internal degrees of freedom which, in turn, causes a net motion, say forward, lateral and rotational, for the snake robot.

The parameterized gaits, as their name suggests, can be described by a relative simple parameterized function, whereas the scripted cannot.

{"abstract": "We consider the use of multi-agent systems to control network routing. Conventional approaches to this task are based on Ideal Shortest Path routing Algorithm (ISPA), under which at each moment each agent in the network sends all of its traffic down the path that will incur the lowest cost to that traffic. We demonstrate in computer experiments that due to the sideeffects of one agent\u2019s actions on another agent\u2019s traffic, use of ISPA\u2019s can result in large global cost. In particular, in a simulation of Braess\u2019 paradox we see that adding new capacity to a network with ISPA agents can decrease overall throughput. The theory of COllective INtelligence (COIN) design concerns precisely the issue of avoiding such side-effects. We use that theory to derive an idealized routing algorithm and show that a practical machine-learning-based version of this algorithm, in which costs are only imprecisely estimated substantially outperforms the ISPA, despite having access to less information than does the ISPA. In particular, this practical COIN algorithm avoids Braess\u2019 paradox.", "authors": ["Kagan Tumer", "David H.

Classical techniques failed for such conditions. We present the available constraints that allow us to right a projective calibration to a Euclidean one. Meanwhile, we found that the estimations of the internal parameters were rather inaccurate. We discuss theoretically this difficulty and above all the resulting effect on the 3D reconstruction. In fact, we show that the uncertainty on the focal length estimation leads to an Euclidean calibration up to a quasi anisotropic homothety whereas the error on the principal point can often be interpreted as a translation.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we develop a novel unified methodology for performance and robustness analysis of linear dynamical networks. We introduce the notion of systemic measures for the class of first-order linear consensus networks. We classify two important types of performance and robustness measures according to their functional properties: convex systemic measures and Schur-convex systemic measures. It is shown that a viable systemic measure should satisfy several fundamental properties such as homogeneity, monotonicity, convexity, and orthogonal invariance. In order to support our proposed unified framework, we verify functional properties of several existing performance and robustness measures from the literature and show that they all belong to the class of systemic measures. Moreover, we introduce new classes of systemic measures based on (a version of) the well-known Riemann zeta function, input-output system norms, and etc. Then, it is shown that for a given linear dynamical network one can take several different strategies to optimize a given performance and robustness systemic measure via convex optimization.

{"abstract": "A generic function is a function that can be instantiated on many data types to obtain data type specific functionality. Examples of generic functions are the functions that can be derived in Haskell, such as  show ,  read , and '=='. The recent years have seen a number of proposals that support the definition of generic functions. Some of the proposals define new languages, some define extensions to existing languages. As a common characteristic none of the proposals can be made to work within Haskell 98: they all require something extra, either a more sophisticated type system or an additional language construct. The purpose of this pearl is to show that one can, in fact, program generically within Haskell 98 obviating to some extent the need for fancy type systems or separate tools.

{"abstract": "Cloud computing is an emerging technology paradigm that revolutionizes the computing landscape by providing on-demand delivery of software, platform, and infrastructure over the Internet. Yet, architecting, deploying, and configuring enterprise applications to run well on modern clouds remains a challenge due to associated complexities and non-trivial implications. The natural and presumably unbiased approach to these questions is thorough testing before moving applications to production settings. However, thorough testing of enterprise applications on modern clouds is cumbersome and error-prone due to a large number of relevant scenarios and difficulties in testing process. We address some of these challenges through Expertus---a flexible code generation framework for automated performance testing of distributed applications in Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) clouds. Expertus uses a multi-pass compiler approach and leverages template-driven code generation to modularly incorporate different software applications on IaaS clouds. Expertus automatically handles complex configuration dependencies of software applications and significantly reduces human errors associated with manual approaches for software configuration and testing. To date, Expertus has been used to study three distributed applications on five IaaS clouds with over 10,000 different hardware, software, and virtualization configurations. The flexibility and extensibility of Expertus and our own experience on using it shows that new clouds, applications, and software packages can easily be incorporated.", "authors": ["Deepal Jayasinghe", "Galen S.

{"abstract": "Kernel-level rootkits affect system security by modifying key kernel data structures to achieve a variety of malicious goals. While early rootkits modified control data structures, such as the system call table and values of function pointers, recent work has demonstrated rootkits that maliciously modify non-control data. Prior techniques for rootkit detection fail to identify such rootkits either because they focus solely on detecting control data modifications or because they require elaborate, manually-supplied specifications to detect modifications of non-control data. This paper presents a novel rootkit detection technique that automatically detects rootkits that modify both control and non-control data. The key idea is to externally observe the execution of the kernel during a training period and hypothesize invariants on kernel data structures. These invariants are used as specifications of data structure integrity during an enforcement phase; violation of these invariants indicates the presence of a rootkit. We present the design and implementation of Gibraltar, a tool that uses the above approach to infer and enforce invariants. In our experiments, we found that Gibraltar can detect rootkits that modify both control and non-control data structures, and that its false positive rate and monitoring overheads are negligible.", "authors": ["Arati Baliga", "Vinod Ganapathy", "Liviu Iftode"], "n_citation": 261, "references": ["067d0688-d00e-4bc6-b7a5-03f70c5f3983", "0c23defd-5cc4-45c2-940c-aa6b2cf72fc0", "125048fa-d321-48b9-a265-550441c5c894", "1390c17b-4f7b-4b81-a844-f4e712f3d762", "207aecbb-81f9-48c2-b8be-21119bcceafc", "2660744d-9c55-4eb6-af3c-1d9ee904a447", "3184d624-b3b4-4ac3-9230-4f1ac122f3fd", "331f9085-a480-4c61-a89b-37b94119cbca", "4a65be38-5681-42c2-9961-e56d37b8adee", "51db28b2-c07d-4209-ab7a-4bbc22462cd9", "68d012dc-f6f2-41d4-a751-58361b65bf19", "7412e600-d315-49a1-b7ee-abcf1134bd63", "89d577e5-937e-4883-b209-32caff435f99", "b109da56-918d-45b9-bfa5-07227fa0246f", "bdf2a483-f7c4-45ca-a542-24fdd261870f", "c33391dd-4990-45fd-9aa4-97a3c6740a02", "c60b0aef-c5b2-4dfe-803f-89ad63c4780f", "eafbd356-d8ac-4bcf-b9ed-9d50bf806d84", "ec27db2a-796a-4425-b2d4-b613d626aaf0", "fcced25f-ce89-4e16-aa21-dd6a5f222f3e"], "title": "Automatic Inference and Enforcement of Kernel Data Structure Invariants", "venue": "annual computer security applications conference", "year": 2008, "id": "b997567a-2fda-453f-8917-d508c137ed0f"}

This deformation approach proceeds from the observation that several types of deformation can be uniformly represented as mappings from a  pose space , defined by either an underlying skeleton or a more abstract system of parameters, to displacements in the object local coordinate frames. Once this uniform representation is identified, previously disparate deformation types can be accomplished within a single unified approach. The advantages of this algorithm include improved expressive power and direct manipulation of the desired shapes yet the performance associated with traditional shape interpolation is achievable.

{"abstract": "The complexity of large distributed real-time systems can be reduced by partitioning the system into a set of almost autonomous subsystems that are connected by stable control-free interfaces called temporal firewalls. A temporal firewall provides an understandable abstraction of the subsystem behind the firewall, confines the impact of most changes to the encapsulated subsystem, and limits the potential of error propagation.

{"abstract": "The Turing Test (TT) is claimed by many to be a way to test for the presence, in computers, of such ``deep'' phenomena as thought and consciousness. Unfortunately, attempts to build computational systems able to pass TT (or at least restricted versions of this test) have devolved into shallow symbol manipulation designed to, by hook or by crook, trick. The human creators of such systems know all too well that they have merely tried to fool those people who interact with their systems into believing that these systems really have minds. And the problem is fundamental: the structure of the TT is such as to cultivate tricksters. A better test is one that insists on a certain restrictive epistemic relation between an artificial agent (or system) A, its output o, and the human architect H of A \u2013 a relation which, roughly speaking, obtains when H cannot account for how A produced o. We call this test the ``Lovelace Test'' in honor of Lady Lovelace, who believed that only when computers originate things should they be believed to have minds.", "authors": ["Selmer Bringsjord", "Paul Bello", "David A.

{"abstract": "Traits are a programming language technology that promote the reuse of methods between unrelated classes. This paper reports on a refactoring of the Smalltalk collections classes using traits. The original collection classes contained much duplication of code; traits let us remove all of it. We also found places where the protocols of the collections lacked uniformity; traits allowed us to correct these non-uniformities  without  code duplication.Traits also make it possible to reuse fragments of collection code  outside  of the existing hierarchy; for example, they make it easy to convert other collection-like things into true collections. Our refactoring reduced the number of methods in the collection classes by approximately 10 per cent.

If the postural disequilibrium that occurs persists beyond the time an individual is within the confines of the laboratory or system site, user safety could be compromised and products liability issues could be forthcoming. In this study, a portable, automated postural assessment system is developed that can be employed before and after exposure to a virtual reality (VR) system in order to certify that a user's balance on exiting the system is at least demonstrably as good as it was on entering. It is argued that if the \u201ccoming out\u201d balance performance is sufficiently poorer than the \u201cgoing in\u201d balance, then the user should be retained until the pretest balance performance is regained.

{"abstract": "The increased demand for mobile communication and use of mobile devices in high-latency, resource impoverished environments has spurred the development and growth of Delay-Tolerant Networks (DTN). DTNs aim to provide interoperability between a range of heterogeneous networks, operating under resource-constrained circumstances and traditional infrastructure networks such as the Internet. Because of the circumstances, DTNs possess some interesting characteristics that make a traditional end-to-end security paradigm unsuitable and increase the value of the overlay's resources. Controlling access to overlay resources and providing for secure group communications over unknown intermediate networks is essential. We propose a novel solution based on previous work in secure group communications using key-graphs and in extension to work on scalable access authorization in self-organizing overlays to provide a scalable mechanism for access control and secure group communications in DTNs. Since resources are especially limited, our implementation focuses on minimizing the traffic on the overlay associated with the maintenance of our solution.", "authors": ["Paul T.

{"abstract": "Requirements engineering is concerned with the elicitation of high-level goals to be achieved by the envisioned system, the refinement of such goals and their operationalization into specifications of services and constraints and the assignment of responsibilities for the resulting requirements to agents such as humans, devices and software. Requirements engineering processes often result in goals, requirements, and assumptions about agent behavior that are too ideal; some of them are likely not to be satisfied from time to time in the running system due to unexpected agent behavior. The lack of anticipation of exceptional behaviors results in unrealistic, unachievable, and/or incomplete requirements. As a consequence, the software developed from those requirements will not be robust enough and will inevitably result in poor performance or failures, sometimes with critical consequences on the environment. This paper presents formal techniques for reasoning about obstacles to the satisfaction of goals, requirements, and assumptions elaborated in the requirements engineering process. The techniques are based on a temporal logic formalization of goals and domain properties; they are integrated into an existing method for goal-oriented requirements elaboration with the aim of deriving more realistic, complete, and robust requirements specifications. A key principle is to handle exceptions at requirements engineering time and at the goal level, so that more freedom is left for resolving them in a satisfactory way.

In addition to that, Pegasus can automatically translate programs between different natural languages, by the time of writing: German and English.Subsequently, an overview on related work is given, followed by remarks on the advantages and disadvantages of naturalistic programming in general and Pegasus in particular.Finally, an outlook on future research concludes.", "authors": ["Roman Kn\u00f6ll", "Mira Mezini"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1038d197-f98e-45aa-b7b3-8aca43db4b68", "149050aa-3a45-42ac-979a-0733c936a04c", "35f7ba50-c833-4cbe-b81b-18b9975318c5", "46234dba-8fcb-4dae-82ec-04bbefc296bf", "e483ec57-d0c7-4b88-9d25-ec334550dfdc"], "title": "Pegasus: first steps toward a naturalistic programming language", "venue": "conference on object-oriented programming systems, languages, and applications", "year": 2006, "id": "ad1b5829-91e6-4657-998e-c79a55b9fb00"}

{"abstract": "The HyperRed-Black trees are a relaxed version of Red-Black trees accepting a high degree of concurrency. In the Red-Black trees, consecutive red nodes are forbidden. This restriction has been withdrawn in the Chromatic trees introduced by O. Nurni and E. Soisalon-Soininen (1996). These trees have been designed to deal concurrently with insertions and deletions. A major motivation of Chromatic trees seems to be a good performance of the concurrent deletions algorithm. However, concurrent insertions have a serious drawback: in a big cluster of red nodes only the top node can be updated. Direct updating inside the cluster is forbidden. This approach gives us a limited degree of concurrency. The HyperRed-Black trees were designed to solve this problem. It is possible to update red nodes in the inside of a red cluster. In a HyperRed-Black tree, nodes can have a multiplicity of colors; they can be red, black or hyper-red.", "authors": ["Joaquim Gabarr\u00f3", "Xavier Messeguer", "Daniel Riu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["13a2e214-a0d4-4a1a-8de9-2710355f8882", "510cfc74-06be-4beb-b4e1-3ccfa4ef9759", "781e1941-70a0-4f75-b344-49726e0f485b"], "title": "Concurrent rebalancing on HyperRed-Black trees", "venue": "", "year": 1997, "id": "3ca64079-5af1-41a5-9268-0884834c13fa"}

{"abstract": "We present a novel approach to client-side mining of temporal API specifications based on static analysis. Specifically, we present an interprocedural analysis over a combined domain that abstracts both aliasing and event sequences for individual objects. The analysis uses a new family of automata-based abstractions to represent unbounded event sequences, designed to disambiguate distinct usage patterns and merge similar usage patterns. Additionally, our approach includes an algorithm that summarizes abstract traces based on automata clusters, and effectively rules out spurious behaviors. We show experimental results mining specifications from a number of Java clients and APIs. The results indicate that effective static analysis for client-side mining requires fairly precise treatment of aliasing and abstract event sequences. Based on the results, we conclude that static client-side specification mining shows promise as a complement or alternative to dynamic approaches.", "authors": ["Sharon Shoham", "Eran Yahav", "Stephen J.

{"abstract": "Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the standard language for styling web documents and is extensively used in the industry. However, CSS lacks constructs that would allow code reuse (e.g., functions). Consequently, maintaining CSS code is often a cumbersome and error-prone task. Preprocessors (e.g., Less and Sass) have been introduced to fill this gap, by extending CSS with the missing constructs. Despite the clear maintainability benefits coming from the use of preprocessors, there is currently no support for migrating legacy CSS code to preprocessors. In this paper, we propose a technique for automatically detecting duplicated style declarations in CSS code that can be migrated to preprocessor functions (i.e., mixins). Our technique can parameterize differences in the style values of duplicated declarations, and ensure that the migration will not change the presentation semantics of the web documents. The evaluation has shown that our technique is able to detect 98% of the mix-ins that professional developers introduced in websites and Style Sheet libraries, and can safely migrate real CSS code.", "authors": ["Davood Mazinanian", "Nikolaos Tsantalis"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["03fc7d9c-db80-401e-9204-a51133c8845c", "05de7f10-b2c9-44aa-8b7b-e0d8308067e2", "0690db41-a8e5-437e-b6bc-77b569d4d9d7", "0858d3f2-0a93-4eb2-99ac-80eba296b1b8", "08757b7e-437d-424e-a4b8-9518a140f386", "08f8b904-ef7f-4d55-9d95-9e96a27ea097", "11a164f7-7e85-4408-8f23-2e778e80cc9b", "3626b925-594d-48cd-a631-096907d61b5b", "391e3351-f405-45cf-b507-075621b35326", "3e9dc372-aabd-4d63-b971-85c7cb46a1cb", "4266e81a-344d-4148-ab09-062dd6e949be", "4317f382-5bf6-4e40-aaf4-a617a89ca624", "5001b827-029c-4bc8-b64d-3916f9af2ff3", "664d590b-7401-4207-8a75-49572674c3a3", "7543c110-e752-4315-ad13-34956665d31b", "79cb637f-e548-4964-92ef-d0be9f215d40", "7ac221a5-ec95-44c8-ad9b-6851913e7570", "88dd06c7-16e0-4b9f-9e2d-27cd128b3b56", "8d5e2241-c431-40a1-9a8c-ae1de0960205", "8e40521a-f701-4627-92a4-8d3a60688692", "9138b37f-d0df-4268-912d-d2ca80c41c26", "a43e8696-19d3-45e2-b25d-367181e54e85", "a6f60598-d877-4c1f-aa24-432937db7860", "a9bb2246-1ffd-4802-a236-db1c4083c57e", "b4622f32-3e4b-4170-9acb-1e985181f835", "c28cf51b-79cf-4b24-9234-8b304f11e6ca", "c4710c73-497d-44f0-ae10-64613eca18d4", "cb8a8fe5-b6b4-4cdf-ba43-6a5883146ef7", "d2a9e11c-c9a1-4317-b279-1d1955e19d34", "e25ea60d-55e3-4479-8926-02ba7ab384b5", "fd85ed41-d55c-4d0e-b885-ccf10e807bd7"], "title": "Migrating cascading style sheets to preprocessors by introducing mixins", "venue": "automated software engineering", "year": 2016, "id": "671b3152-2fd1-430e-8fe4-6e5e12c3cbdc"}
{"abstract": "This paper considers finite-horizon optimal control for multi-agent systems subject to additive Gaussian-distributed stochastic disturbance and a chance constraint. The problem is particularly difficult when agents are coupled through a joint chance constraint, which limits the probability of constraint violation by any of the agents in the system. Although prior approaches [1][2] can solve such a problem in a centralized manner, scalability is an issue. We propose a dual decomposition-based algorithm, namely Market-based Iterative Risk Allocation (MIRA), that solves the multi-agent problem in a decentralized manner. The algorithm addresses the issue of scalability by letting each agent optimize its own control input given a fixed value of a dual variable, which is shared among agents. A central module optimizes the dual variable by solving a root-finding problem iteratively. MIRA gives exactly the same optimal solution as the centralized optimization approach since it reproduces the KKT conditions of the centralized approach. Although the algorithm has a centralized part, it typically uses less than 0.1% of the total computation time. Our approach is analogous to a price adjustment process in a competitive market called t\u00e2tonnement or Walrasian auction: each agent optimizes its demand for risk at a given price, while the central module (or the market) optimizes the price of risk, which corresponds to the dual variable. We give a proof of the existence and optimality of the solution of our decentralized problem formulation, as well as a theoretical guarantee that MIRA can find the solution. The empirical results demonstrate a significant improvement in scalability.", "authors": ["Masahiro Ono", "Brian C.

{"abstract": "This paper addresses the challenges of integrating existing PHEV charging algorithms, which optimize PHEV charging per market timeslot (e.g., 15 minutes), into an environment with realistic communication conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a dual coordination mechanism, which controls a cluster of devices on two different operation levels: market operation and real-time operation. The market operation level uses an existing timeslot-based algorithm to calculate a charging schedule per timeslot. The real-time operation level translates this schedule into event-based control actions for a realistic communication environment, wherein a limited number of messages can be exchanged. A case study of 1000 PHEVs shows that it is possible to achieve results on par with the timeslot based algorithm but with significantly reduced communication with the PHEVs.", "authors": ["Klaas De Craemer", "Stijn Vandael", "Bert Claessens", "Geert Deconinck"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["136c4780-2f25-4068-90a5-aed6afaf2890", "2098dcd5-4075-4bd3-93f4-ce53883a049a", "321ac9f4-0307-4025-bfc7-94f2e5e85071", "3a907ee3-7d9a-4dd9-9dcb-e2f94d7ed12e", "4077e626-0804-4089-a6e3-dd685a92dc25", "6afba264-7578-4263-b918-321f67e1f8ea", "a3884dc5-57aa-4f41-be8b-e0200a8ec1dc", "bf1b6acb-5001-4fd0-ad90-2137daa29fd7", "caa7486b-f987-49c9-924b-84c2462f66c8", "d3b1ada5-534f-4e76-aa1b-212afbfbb312", "ddde6d15-f1c4-4eaf-8056-e396d2e3877b"], "title": "An Event-Driven Dual Coordination Mechanism for Demand Side Management of PHEVs", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid", "year": 2014, "id": "7efc4655-6a21-46b3-9cb8-b325f5ec3520"}

To describe a general cloud infrastructure, a discrete-time dynamic model is presented together with constraints. The migration strategies of virtual machines are obtained by solving finite-horizon optimal control problems involving integer variables.

{"abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) has become one of the most common tools for diagnosis of retinal abnormalities. Both retinal morphology and layer thickness can provide important information to aid in the differential diagnosis of these abnormalities. Automatic segmentation methods are essential to providing these thickness measurements since the manual delineation of each layer is cumbersome given the sheer amount of data within each OCT scan. In this work, we propose a new method for retinal layer segmentation using a random forest classifier. A total of seven features are extracted from the OCT data and used to simultaneously classify nine layer boundaries. Taking advantage of the probabilistic nature of random forests, probability maps for each boundary are extracted and used to help refine the classification. We are able to accurately segment eight retinal layers with an average Dice coefficient of 0.79 \u00b1 0.13 and a mean absolute error of 1.21 \u00b1 1.45 pixels for the layer boundaries.", "authors": ["Andrew Lang", "Aaron Carass", "Elias S.

{"abstract": "A multi-tier wireless system integrates the high-tier wireless systems and the low-tier wireless systems into a single system to provide the advantages of both tiers. Such a system is expected to provide better service (more service availability and more cost effectiveness to the users) at the expense of the extra tier-switching management. Examples of multi-tier systems include the interconnection network of a satellite communication network and a terrestrial cellular network, the integration of low-power systems such as wireless personal area networks and cellular systems, and the integration of higher mobility of cellular systems with low-mobility wireless local area networks. In such a system, mobility management is critical, because only when the location of a mobile user is known or tracked can the service quality for the user be guaranteed. In this paper, we study a few mobility management schemes for multi-tier wireless mobile networks under more realistic assumptions. Performance evaluation in terms of registration signaling traffic is carried out, and easy-to-use analytical results are obtained. It is also clear that for service availability, the two-tier system is better than the single one-tier system; we therefore study the probability that a call is forced to terminate in the single low-tier system because the low tier becomes unavailable during the call (such a call can be continued in the two-tier system).", "authors": ["Yuguang Fang", "Yi-Bing Lin"], "n_citation": 13, "references": ["03297da0-6e29-47b7-b238-ff12276e9308", "045a04bf-0fed-4695-9935-4f28cad5fdb1", "0b6e81df-2ffa-42ea-bf07-e50d460f5c1c", "4523af93-5f48-4e87-9f99-9c21c72fc75c", "53e6e46a-07e7-4acf-86f3-036259741b75", "9df59094-1abd-485c-9e66-ad1a41c7e6ea", "a708c272-61ef-4c37-8168-2cfb6295428b", "ae86c568-4a6e-4224-ad73-34a0778c321f", "b45244d5-1b65-4503-97fe-8564a218ea11", "cac94146-368e-4a2d-92ba-e9393006f10c", "cdfb1296-86d3-4b7f-90e0-9d0186da159d", "d2dab160-77a1-4aa4-9a17-1fd3a5bda358", "e9b0e241-da9f-495c-83c5-2efbd1853212", "fdc1245a-385e-41c0-970e-da1f1902d796"], "title": "Mobility management and signaling traffic analysis for multi-tier wireless mobile networks", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology", "year": 2005, "id": "67d94dc1-9488-4733-8195-1cc1a95e5b1a"}
{"abstract": "Data abstraction is crucial in the construction of modular programs, since it ensures that internal changes in one module do not propagate to other modules. In object-oriented programs, classes typically enforce data abstraction by providing access to their internal state only through methods. By using method calls in method contracts, data abstraction can be extended to specifications. In this paper, methods used for this purpose must be side-effect free, and are called pure methods.#R##N##R##N#We present an approach to the automatic verification of object-oriented programs that use pure methods for data abstraction. The cornerstone of our approach is the solution to the framing problem, i.e. client code must be able to determine whether state changes affect the return values of pure methods. More specifically, we extend each method contract with a method footprint, an upper bound on the memory locations read or written by the corresponding method. Footprints are specified using dynamic frames, special pure methods that return sets of memory locations. Thanks to this abstraction, implementations can evolve independently from specifications, loosely coupled only by pure functions.#R##N##R##N#We implemented this approach in a custom build of the Spec# program verifier, and used it to automatically verify several challenging programs, including the iterator and observer patterns.

{"abstract": "Emerging GPGPU architectures, along with programming models like CUDA and OpenCL, offer a cost-effective platform for many applications by providing high thread level parallelism at lower energy budgets. Unfortunately, for many general-purpose applications, available hardware resources of a GPGPU are not efficiently utilized, leading to lost opportunity in improving performance. A major cause of this is the inefficiency of current warp scheduling policies in tolerating long memory latencies.   In this paper, we identify that the scheduling decisions made by such policies are agnostic to thread-block, or cooperative thread array (CTA), behavior, and as a result inefficient. We present a coordinated CTA-aware scheduling policy that utilizes four schemes to minimize the impact of long memory latencies. The first two schemes, CTA-aware two-level warp scheduling and locality aware warp scheduling, enhance per-core performance by effectively reducing cache contention and improving latency hiding capability. The third scheme, bank-level parallelism aware warp scheduling, improves overall GPGPU performance by enhancing DRAM bank-level parallelism. The fourth scheme employs opportunistic memory-side prefetching to further enhance performance by taking advantage of open DRAM rows. Evaluations on a 28-core GPGPU platform with highly memory-intensive applications indicate that our proposed mechanism can provide 33% average performance improvement compared to the commonly-employed round-robin warp scheduling policy.", "authors": ["Adwait Jog", "Onur Kayiran", "Nachiappan Chidambaram Nachiappan", "Asit K.

{"abstract": "This study examines the differences between Scopus and Web of Science in the citation counting, citation ranking, and h-index of 22 top human-computer interaction (HCI) researchers from EQUATOR\u2014a large British Interdisciplinary Research Collaboration project. Results indicate that Scopus provides significantly more coverage of HCI literature than Web of Science, primarily due to coverage of relevant ACM and IEEE peer-reviewed conference proceedings. No significant differences exist between the two databases if citations in journals only are compared. Although broader coverage of the literature does not significantly alter the relative citation ranking of individual researchers, Scopus helps distinguish between the researchers in a more nuanced fashion than Web of Science in both citation counting and h-index. Scopus also generates significantly different maps of citation networks of individual scholars than those generated by Web of Science. The study also presents a comparison of h-index scores based on Google Scholar with those based on the union of Scopus and Web of Science. The study concludes that Scopus can be used as a sole data source for citation-based research and evaluation in HCI, especially when citations in conference proceedings are sought, and that researchers should manually calculate h scores instead of relying on system calculations. \u00a9 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "authors": ["Lokman I.

{"abstract": "The modeling and enactment of business processes is being recognized as key to modern information managment. The expansion of Web services has increased the attention given to processes, because processes are how services are composed and put to good use. However, current approaches are inadequate for flexibly modeling and enacting processes. These approaches take a logically centralized view of processes, treating a process as an implementation of a composed service. They provide low-level scripting languages to specify how a service may be implemented, rather than what interactions are expected from it. Consequently, existing approaches fail to adequately accommodate the essential properties of the business partners in a process (the partners would be realized via services)---their  autonomy  (freedom of action),  heterogeneity  (freedom of design), and  dynamism  (freedom of configuration).Flexibly represented  protocols  can provide a more natural basis for specifying processes. Protocols specify  what  rather than  how ; thus they naturally maximize the authonomy, heterogeneity, and dynamism of the interacting parties. We are developing an approach for modeling and enacting business processes based on protocols. This paper describes some elements of (1) a conceptual model of processes that will incorporate abstractions based on protocols, roles, and commitments; (2)the semantics or mathematical foundations underlying the conceptual model and mapping global views of processes to the local actions of the parties involved; (3) methodologies involving rule-based reasoning to specify processes in terms of compositions of protocols.", "authors": ["Munindar P.

{"abstract": "We study the performance of a statistical multiplexer whose inputs consist of a superposition of packetized voice sources and data. The performance analysis predicts voice packet delay distributions, which usually have a stringent requirement, as well as data packet delay distributions. The superposition is approximated by a correlated Markov modulated Poisson process (MMPP), which is chosen such that several of its statistical characteristics identically match those of the superposition. Matrix analytic methods are then used to evaluate system performance measures. In particular, we obtain moments of voice and data delay distributions and queue length distributions. We also obtain Laplace-Stieitjes transforms of the voice and data packet delay distributions, which are numerically inverted to evaluate tails of delay distributions. It is shown how the matrix analytic methodology can incorporate practical system considerations such as finite buffers and a class of overload control mechanisms discussed in the literature. Comparisons with simulation show the methods to be accurate. The numerical results for the tails of the voice packet delay distribution show the dramatic effect of traffic variability and correlations on performance.", "authors": ["Harry Heffes", "David M.

{"abstract": "Groups of collaborative agents need to have a single view of the world to act as single entities. Building common awareness in agent groups involves reconciling different views of the world and deciding a single view that every agent within the group accepts. The notion of collective belief has been used extensively in formal models for collaborative activity to deal with group awareness. However, collective belief alone is not sufficient for organized groups to act as single entities. In human organizations, members of groups accept that certain states hold based on shared group practices/policies and beliefs of individual agents. These acceptances are formed even if some members of the group do not believe that the corresponding states hold. This paper distinguishes between individual beliefs and group acceptances in multi-agent systems in well-organized settings. It introduces state recognition recipes that drive groups within organizations to create common awareness, explains the exploitation of these recipes and presents an example that shows the potential of the approach.", "authors": ["Ioannis Partsakoulakis", "George A.

This paper presents a new solution to the image segmentation problem that is based on the design of a rule-based expert system.

In addition to the knowledge rules, a set of control rules are also employed. These include metarules that embody inferences about the order in which the knowledge rules are matched. They also incorporate focus of attention rules that determine the path of processing within the image. Furthermore, an additional set of higher level rules dynamically alters the processing strategy.

{"abstract": "The mobile apps market is one of the fastest growing areas in the information technology. In digging their market share, developers must pay attention to building robust and reliable apps. In fact, users easily get frustrated by repeated failures, crashes, and other bugs; hence, they abandon some apps in favor of their competition. In this paper we investigate how the fault- and change-proneness of APIs used by Android apps relates to their success estimated as the average rating provided by the users to those apps. First, in a study conducted on 5,848 (free) apps, we analyzed how the ratings that an app had received correlated with the fault- and change-proneness of the APIs such app relied upon. After that, we surveyed 45 professional Android developers to assess (i) to what extent developers experienced problems when using APIs, and (ii) how much they felt these problems could be the cause for unfavorable user ratings. The results of our studies indicate that apps having high user ratings use APIs that are less fault- and change-prone than the APIs used by low rated apps. Also, most of the interviewed Android developers observed, in their development experience, a direct relationship between problems experienced with the adopted APIs and the users\u2019 ratings that their apps received.", "authors": ["Gabriele Bavota", "Mario Linares-V\u00e1squez", "Carlos Bernal-C\u00e1rdenas", "Massimiliano Di Penta", "Rocco Oliveto", "Denys Poshyvanyk"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0e9bef33-a3fc-4fda-bd2b-0e44738c2d34", "11b4635f-1693-48aa-96ac-22d7ba540c24", "146e8fe4-39bd-4e6a-9cdf-616e08ce7df5", "16e7483e-4c46-49ee-8620-019f386d230a", "195ce5a0-d2b3-4ba8-af03-4c510215525b", "1989b23c-3190-460f-92b6-6982c861a346", "1c15a2a7-8d65-4490-8336-5e31981d3913", "2457e34f-479d-45d9-b6ff-570ed9a10a69", "2d04fc67-c519-4a47-9411-67ba4768dfff", "3162347e-9594-466f-9db5-4e1a0710836a", "365c4069-696f-48c1-82a6-37ffb49fa1af", "3683c706-6049-485b-a7a8-a4e2c5e13867", "371a8613-976c-4d70-832c-4d90923ba660", "373dbaad-b567-491b-8356-9daea6110361", "3a12e126-f779-4372-8f01-ac4d42f77646", "42bf6e7a-1dbb-454d-a116-112d357faaca", "4a587cb8-5f6d-4180-b4ac-8a64a6acbd08", "5a1e88a6-8df7-48e3-a1cd-88b36c2b8e5c", "5ea012d7-e381-44f5-8b83-f833cef3a29a", "656ac119-7099-4ac3-9615-caedc0a0d5b2", "65d4290e-78bb-4229-b674-5e3fde4314ee", "66d0b18e-c052-4c23-b262-73acc9d32814", "7037f4d8-6717-423b-bcff-310da75ae4fb", "712ec588-2648-406f-bc4a-4c387d08ea39", "7238cc7b-08c7-4c01-938d-fcad19101b7f", "734edaf9-7684-4e9c-9743-b42a9686c636", "75df364c-324c-48d1-90a6-c214e656dbcb", "7cb79717-c277-4150-95c3-58f5dfa6d4b0", "8306c6b0-1598-4c3e-9c2d-1d9e30c13a7f", "85c3ec01-4da9-4982-82b3-2eab699f871a", "9513d23b-e3d9-44b6-bf2e-0963e1ad6441", "a51508d5-b74b-4fe8-a8e6-a2fc18a9a4ce", "a73da958-10ca-41b3-9f54-4e3fd9d2a3bd", "ae3f3ed3-3496-41be-a244-d5bb33a8b924", "af8ca0cf-2c2a-4ca5-95f6-0fce3be39384", "b4ddf96f-8c01-47ca-8664-1e12868f8a03", "b82c44e8-455a-4683-81bb-169364bb8654", "b91f939e-41d2-4b91-8561-d8b5bcb10826", "be861111-37c8-417a-997c-e446e4bf8e2d", "c3aa4060-6161-4f98-8ba4-a0bb40293890", "c5c550c2-33a4-4984-b745-fdcf9514a84c", "cb471966-7f91-4cd7-80f1-1d78c51fb4cf", "cd2d8bd4-62e4-43ca-8eae-f4cfa93a10b0", "d766b165-6ac6-44bf-9f9a-0d3d2c2a1aeb", "de39a303-785e-4570-a72e-31616e013660", "e1bc3c2e-c97e-44d8-bf08-34dd4f69c38b", "e5312ed1-0a24-4294-a6b6-e173722f8beb", "e5827e9c-9414-425c-8246-587461c5c230", "efa59161-f5a1-41e2-9e77-3267d78d9336", "fe1c3535-c0e9-43b8-a1d9-78c8108eea64"], "title": "The Impact of API Change- and Fault-Proneness on the User Ratings of Android Apps", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "6ae81c56-34b8-4b96-9384-13933566f7dd"}

{"abstract": "Most cellular processes depend on intracellular locations and random collisions of individual protein molecules. To model these processes, we developed algorithms to simulate the diffusion, membrane interactions, and reactions of individual molecules, and implemented these in the Smoldyn program. Compared to the popular MCell and ChemCell simulators, we found that Smoldyn was in many cases more accurate, more computationally efficient, and easier to use. Using Smoldyn, we modeled pheromone response system signaling among yeast cells of opposite mating type. This model showed that secreted Bar1 protease might help a cell identify the fittest mating partner by sharpening the pheromone concentration gradient. This model involved about 200,000 protein molecules, about 7000 cubic microns of volume, and about 75 minutes of simulated time; it took about 10 hours to run. Over the next several years, as faster computers become available, Smoldyn will allow researchers to model and explore systems the size of entire bacterial and smaller eukaryotic cells.", "authors": ["Steven S.

{"abstract": "Interactive virtual environments are becoming increasingly popular for their utility in education, virtual training, and entertainment. These applications often rely on a scenario that is revealed to the user as he/she interacts with synthetic objects and characters that inhabit virtual worlds. Current interactive narrative architectures used in the interactive entertainment industry often use decision trees, which are hard to author and modify. Some interactive entertainment productions are starting to use more generative techniques, such as plan-based or goal-based narrative. In this paper, I present an interactive narrative architecture that extends current research in interactive narrative by integrating a user modeling and user behavior analysis technique, which I argue facilities a more engaging and fulfilling experience. I have implemented the architecture within an interactive story called  Mirage.  The architecture resulted from an iterative design and development process involving a team that included film and theatre professionals. During this design and development process, I have experimented and evaluated different narrative techniques, which resulted in the proposed architecture.", "authors": ["Magy Seif El-Nasr"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["3a53fc20-f37c-4b2d-9e7f-e25cc0cc250c", "58b6f697-1db3-43e2-9aad-bcca97d3ebb6", "827cfd3b-1475-4cb3-8009-4df776ebeb22", "f8290e0d-727b-4405-ae8c-2e8e4c71347e", "fe0eb4ab-4b72-4992-a137-7371364f010d"], "title": "A user-centric adaptive story architecture: borrowing from acting theories", "venue": "", "year": 2004, "id": "ed62af69-dad5-4e62-a1d8-c7867158f58b"}

{"abstract": "Abstract   Product-form approximations, based on the principle of Maximum Entropy (ME), are characterised for general multi-buffered and shared buffer discrete-time queueing models with Arrivals First (AF) and Departures First (DF) buffer management policies. The arrival process at each queue is assumed to be bursty and it is modelled by a Compound Bernoulli Process (CBP) with geometrically distributed bulk sizes. The forms of the joint, aggregate and marginal state probabilities, as well as basic performance measures such as mean queue length and cell-loss probability, are analytically established at equilibrium via appropriate mean value constraints and the generating function approach. Consequently, efficient recursive expressions of low computational cost are established. Focusing on a shared buffer ATM switch architecture under DF policy, validation tests against simulation show that the ME approximation has a very good error level. Further experimentation illustrates the credibility of the ME solutions and carries out performance comparisons between multi-buffered and shared buffer ATM switch architectures.", "authors": ["Demetres D.

{"abstract": "The advent of high-throughput short read technology is revolutionizing life sciences by providing an inexpensive way to sequence genomes at high coverage. Exploiting this technology requires the development of a de novo short read assembler, which is an important open problem that is garnering significant research effort. Current methods are largely limited to microbial organisms, whose genomes are two to three orders of magnitude smaller than complex mammalian and plant genomes. In this paper, we present the design and development of a parallel de novo short read assembler that can scale to large genomes with high coverage. Our approach is based on the string graph formulation. Input reads are mapped to short paths, and the genome is reconstructed as a superpath anchored by distance constraints inferred from read pairs. Our method can handle a mixture of multiple read sizes and multiple paired read distances. We present parallel algorithms for string graph construction, string graph compaction, graph based error detection and removal, and computing aggregate summarization of paired read links across graph edges. Using this, we navigate the final graph structure to reproduce large contiguous sequences from the underlying genome.

Its application scenario is the Bremen Autonomous Wheelchair \"Rolland\" that is developed as an autonomous transport vehicle for hospitals. The paper consists of two parts. First, a laser scan matching method is presented that improves an algorithm originally proposed by Weiss et al. (1994) in several aspects. Then, a mapping approach is introduced that is based on the scan matching method. Using a laser scanner mounted on the wheelchair, it generates consistent maps, i.e. maps that do not have discontinuities resulting from the accumulation of errors in the mapping process. As such accumulations cannot be avoided, the resulting errors are corrected whenever the wheelchair returns to areas already mapped An important property of the presented approach is its real-time capability. The mapping is performed on the fly and, thus, the resulting maps can immediately be employed for self-localization.", "authors": ["Thomas R\u00f6fer"], "n_citation": 98, "references": ["12fff395-a82d-4dee-901d-92588447b389", "52bccc7d-ea2e-41ad-8357-2dd532191fea", "555501d9-20d8-4101-ba7f-a2dd9b332fba", "55b4d6cc-785d-490c-a190-b6c0520dc670", "91630a3c-69ae-45bd-8097-08a9d7d6e1e8", "a51b1e5a-30c4-422f-ada0-8687a517adef", "b461c5ff-ed60-428b-a1bc-4b83b52b58bd", "c4fb773f-dcca-43b2-a32e-58e98d4b6d51", "f83224dc-6d77-4797-81fa-c641905da575"], "title": "Using histogram correlation to create consistent laser scan maps", "venue": "intelligent robots and systems", "year": 2002, "id": "eb39f3fd-fc8a-4408-a309-d8c34b9362f9"}
{"abstract": "In the last few years, we have seen an upsurge of interest in content-based image retrieval (CBIR)\u2014the selection of images from a collection via features extracted from images themselves. Often, a single image attribute may not have enough discriminative information for successful retrieval. On the other hand when multiple features are used, it is hard to determine the suitable weighing factors for various features for optimal retrieval. In this paper, we present a relevance feedback framework with Integrated Probability Function (IPF) which combines multiple features for optimal retrieval. The IPF is based on a new posterior probability estimator and a novel weight updating approach. We perform experiments on 1400 monochromatic trademark images have been performed. The proposed IPF is shown to be more e6ective and e7cient to retrieve deformed trademark images than the commonly used integrated dissimilarity function. The new posterior probability estimator is shown to be generally better than the existing one. The proposed novel weight updating approach by relevance feedback is shown to be better than both the existing scoring approach and the existing ratio approach. In experiments, 95% of the targets are ranked at the top ;ve positions. By two iterations of relevance feedback, retrieval performance can be improved from 75% to over 95%.

{"abstract": "This paper describes an experiment in the design of a general purpose fault tolerant system, FTM. The main objective of the FTM design was to implement a low-cost fault-tolerant system that could be used on standard workstations. At the operating system level, the authors' goal was to offer fault-tolerance transparency to user applications. In other words, porting an application to FTM need only require compiling the source code without having to modify it. These objectives were achieved using the Mach micro-kernel and a modular set of reliable servers which implement application checkpoints and provide continuous system functions despite machine crashes. At the architectural level, their approach relies on a high-performance stable storage implementation, called stable transactional memory (STM), which can be implemented either by hardware or software. The authors first motivate their design choices, then detail the FTM implementation at both architectural and operating system level. They discuss the reasons for the evolution of their stable memory technology from hardware to software. They evaluate the performance of the FTM prototype. They conclude with lessons learned and give some assessments.", "authors": ["Gilles Muller", "Michel Banatre", "Nadine Peyrouze", "Bruno Rochat"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0570eb1e-e66a-480e-923a-a998bf01033e", "06abecfe-e952-41e0-b851-883831be3e6c", "0ce74249-8be4-45f5-96de-c5fb2c69c2e9", "12ee23b1-876e-47f8-9bbe-8d64c50c5545", "1465103a-0aaa-4ea5-989b-1f7c491094f4", "1e3d69cb-a81f-4684-a513-6c2b39491ab9", "21f68102-681f-4ea2-a93a-f4fb4f809a19", "25b9b84d-5bf6-4a66-b01f-81fd9138e296", "2fc3b7a7-e477-431e-aa55-e7e5c9cabbb4", "32d89b1d-a741-4a7b-85fc-6e0fcb09b754", "46d23d67-07cb-4f3b-a12e-28e8f75cba24", "4f3ff5a9-25d1-4390-a354-9bb398d6cf45", "5137459d-b044-4d27-b8fc-38d5ba3d04f7", "5179e990-6e5a-463b-88e6-3ae5bc331550", "765a5f62-24d9-4ae0-a6d9-79c143d6d5eb", "7c6e2caf-f5cf-471a-81f4-f24ac7889a49", "99f678c6-6e53-4c95-9c7a-e206a6cc8a87", "9a809bc8-abc8-47ec-b318-78d259854ff9", "a05eb302-32c9-4d7b-a360-5af7fc56528c", "ad4eff53-a46e-4c95-b265-4f2e8db755ad", "b191cacd-6391-4886-b33a-13195714d42a", "c107a714-117a-4c89-b3ac-0563379bfacc", "cb4a0395-8eb3-4ffa-b654-321e82f2d48d", "d534aefc-d7d3-43f7-8afc-c25525849e41", "dde2ad4e-8385-4608-8f42-d6e08982a14a", "e1da5f9a-623f-4393-bc0e-8d866bf38eca", "f0563a8b-3cad-4ed4-9b87-77cb768ff01d"], "title": "Lessons from FTM: an experiment in design and implementation of a low-cost fault tolerant system", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Reliability", "year": 1996, "id": "c15dce94-633b-4036-9b59-787ae4b5c835"}
{"abstract": "Real-time embedded applications such as signal-processing, surveillance and tracking, data fusion, and automated target recognition need parallel processors to meet their performance requirements. Unfortunately the task of developing the application-software, which must not only make efficient use of the available parallelism but must also integrate the many algorithms that comprise it, is extremely difficult. Current software design methods, including object oriented design methods, do not help in this regard as they are geared primarily for the design of sequential software.This paper presents an overview of the Parallel Scalable Design Toolset (PSDT) being developed at Honeywell to support the design and development of real-time embedded parallel software. Software designers can use PSDT to graphically specify parallelism across collections of objects and within objects, and synchronization of data and control flows. They can also compose parallel subtasks into tasks that may in turn be a part of other tasks.PSDT can support different domain-specific parallelization paradigms. Each paradigm defines composition rules and constraints on inter- and intra-object parallelism.

The methods presented here are useful in reducing variations in acoustic features.

{"abstract": "The convergence of mobile computing and cloud computing assumes that the cloud is easily accessible at all times. In other words, there is good end-to-end network quality and few network or cloud failures. Unfortunately, this assumption is untenable in several important contexts that we collectively refer to as hostile environments. The prime example of a hostile environment is a theater of military operations. Another example is a geographical region where recovery is under way after a natural disaster or terrorist attack. A third example is a developing country with weak networking infrastructure. More generally, even a well-connected region of the public Internet may become a hostile environment under conditions of cyber attack. In this talk I will explore how cloudlets, orginally motivated by narrow considerations of end-to-end latency, can play a much broader and more foundational role for mobile computing in hostile environments. We advocate a design strategy in which a cloudlet is completely transparent under normal conditions, giving mobile users the illusion that they are directly interacting with the cloud; under failure conditions, the cloudlet masks the absence of the cloud by performing its essential services.", "authors": ["Mahadev Satyanarayanan", "Grace A.

{"abstract": "Traditional speaker authentication focuses on speaker verification (SV) and speaker identification, which is accomplished by matching the speaker's voice with his or her registered speech patterns. In this paper, we propose a new technique, verbal information verification (VIV), in which spoken utterances of a claimed speaker are verified against the key (usually confidential) information in the speaker's registered profile automatically; to decide whether the claimed identity should be accepted or rejected. Using the proposed sequential procedure involving three question-response turns, we achieved an error-free result in a telephone speaker authentication experiment with 100 speakers. We further propose a speaker authentication system by combining VIV with SV. In the system, a user is verified by VIV in the first four to five accesses, usually from different acoustic environments. During these uses, one of the key questions pertains to a pass-phrase for SV. The VIV system collects and verifies the pass-phrase utterance for use as training data for speaker model construction. After a speaker-dependent model is constructed, the system then migrates to SV. This approach avoids the inconvenience of a formal enrollment procedure, ensures the quality of the training data for SV, and mitigates the mismatch caused by different acoustic environments between training and testing. Experiments showed that the proposed system improved the SV performance by over 40% in equal-error rate compared to a conventional SV system.", "authors": ["Qi Li", "Biing-Hwang Juang", "Chin-Hui Lee"], "n_citation": 81, "references": ["019655ee-3a1c-45e9-a710-0d08b678d4fc", "299ca187-5875-4f74-a39c-e07bf84341e9", "362ec9ad-7043-44f6-b01d-dc8f32c4e25e", "3b5f5157-ec92-4e25-ab25-e80d5db6dd02", "3cc921cd-594f-4ca8-b5d5-fe276254347f", "6f51fc64-2a9e-4868-bdcd-fe4811fb521e", "9e845ca5-eaf0-4128-9697-3b49cf457868", "9f1c57c9-ae6c-4e00-b3ee-10256adb3cb1", "a1c66e77-d1d3-4167-8b76-3b5db162698c", "c2c44a03-93ad-4572-9aed-987d290bc80c", "eb23b092-8ec6-4a7a-bae2-26f8f87691ef", "edefa49b-d336-4c9b-9657-289c0661be41", "f331b2c4-ae8a-471d-beeb-886640832bef"], "title": "Automatic verbal information verification for user authentication", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Speech and Audio Processing", "year": 2000, "id": "8557d60e-c07d-4f2a-8d4b-9d56090483a8"}
{"abstract": "Business and military partners, companies and their customers, and other closely cooperating parties may have a compelling need to conduct sensitive interactions on line, such as accessing each other's local services and other local resources. Automated trust negotiation is an approach to establishing trust between parties so that such interactions can take place, through the use of access control policies that specify what combinations of digital credentials a stranger must disclose to gain access to a local resource. A party can use many different strategies to negotiate trust, offering tradeoffs between the length of the negotiation, the amount of extraneous information disclosed, and the computational effort expended. To preserve parties' autonomy, each party should ideally be able to choose its negotiation strategy independently, while still being guaranteed that negotiations will succeed whenever possible---that the two parties' strategies will interoperate. In this paper we provide the formal underpinnings for that goal, by formalizing the concepts of negotiation protocols, strategies, and interoperation. We show how to model the information flow of a negotiation for use in analyzing strategy interoperation. We also present two large sets of strategies whose members all interoperate with one another, and show that these sets contain many practical strategies. We develop the theory for black-box propositional credentials as well as credentials with internal structure, and for access control policies whose contents are (respectively are not) sensitive. We also discuss how these results fit into TrustBuilder, our prototype system for trust negotiation.", "authors": ["Ting Yu", "Marianne Winslett", "Kent E.

{"abstract": "Data races are among the most reliable indicators of programming errors in concurrent software. For at least two decades, Lamport's happens-before (HB) relation has served as the standard test for detecting races--other techniques, such as lockset-based approaches, fail to be sound, as they may falsely warn of races. This work introduces a new relation, causally-precedes (CP), which generalizes happens-before to observe more races without sacrificing soundness. Intuitively, CP tries to capture the concept of happens-before ordered events that must occur in the observed order for the program to observe the same values. What distinguishes CP from past predictive race detection approaches (which also generalize an observed execution to detect races in other plausible executions) is that CP-based race detection is both sound and of polynomial complexity. We demonstrate that the unique aspects of CP result in practical benefit. Applying CP to real-world programs, we successfully analyze server-level applications (e.g., Apache FtpServer) and show that traces longer than in past predictive race analyses can be analyzed in mere seconds to a few minutes. For these programs, CP race detection uncovers races that are hard to detect by repeated execution and HB race detection: a single run of CP race detection produces several races not discovered by 10 separate rounds of happens-before race detection.", "authors": ["Yannis Smaragdakis", "Jacob Evans", "Caitlin Sadowski", "Jaeheon Yi", "Cormac Flanagan"], "n_citation": 82, "references": ["0299aed8-07f6-4d79-a012-f7493e11520f", "049aed6a-456d-4c19-aa00-e994dd18051c", "06ffefee-1eff-4644-8d0f-3d2c6563888f", "119162d6-0403-4980-8096-f6fa5d9fc228", "136c4780-2f25-4068-90a5-aed6afaf2890", "17d60dc9-9dc8-47c8-a6af-b5e5226589e1", "1c4ea428-5240-4b00-962d-88985f72122c", "20b606d4-3c15-4578-9cd2-bd68c2bf7f44", "2cde15bf-b5a4-4d47-955f-f680a86f5f84", "2f7ce0a2-061d-4a89-8ed9-a053cfb6a9c3", "3bb902c9-554a-4ad9-a278-9b754bcad7f1", "44f72296-e648-4e36-a419-81db9da88350", "4afb35e7-b7a0-4349-b190-e656c2cdeb06", "4e9bb45b-db66-4370-a86b-e718b3ae4bdb", "66631f9e-7a16-4710-a06e-86c44780a20c", "6c20a4a2-0e3f-4446-b2e9-5f454d91b1c9", "6d8a872d-a40d-4a79-bf32-58444aa93310", "7f0f937c-f854-47ff-b5fb-aca9314414b9", "82accccf-000a-415a-960f-fd9ff7ee2152", "84d6b71c-7e30-41c0-9d8c-fcd5e44b2550", "87f75661-a934-4fde-8fcc-352a4fbf15ba", "8b92c458-dc0f-4522-a3a8-373ba57ac661", "904ddaa4-16e7-47c9-9c03-58e3d0761f20", "93672072-a749-47c6-b866-8ff2da2902ca", "9acef219-b063-49cb-97e9-ca3f0b96e02f", "a08664cd-8060-4cd6-849f-63f4fe19fdf5", "a266afad-5849-4504-ab50-cdad885207d8", "a6e2c70d-0585-4f13-8f28-45831696af3e", "b5894e8e-1774-45b2-9b34-23d2330878d0", "bd702458-a06c-43bc-86aa-dec9f89e608e", "bdf70c72-fd7a-4728-bc06-47ec650cab54", "c02cb9af-a5d4-4cf7-8433-46d2240099a4", "c39780a6-ef0e-4309-b8ad-7d5a74377b5a", "c4c9de24-747e-4bf7-a061-8dc1039b1e17", "c598a093-9cba-4002-8ea3-8e1c8235c94d", "c915c569-67e6-4770-91d4-133b0fc6531e", "cb07a6bc-7acc-4eb5-964f-c8ece4a6ed65", "d1c52eff-d2a2-4b7f-bca3-ddfd18fc3c6d", "d31b5c99-09e5-4045-8021-127997fa477c", "d56f4c7a-ec40-45be-8b74-a2f07e2366f9", "d6513692-83aa-4b8d-9691-de32226cfcdc", "dc492c37-ce50-4729-bd27-6ce0f1b057cc", "de4c497b-5468-4ca6-bb18-d0c979688c10", "e615b739-b572-4630-ba39-99fab70d3fa2", "e6b6ff5c-0f69-4006-b1a0-cd1a91135123", "ed05ebf6-bcb7-4794-9c86-b32cb74918ac", "ef2004e3-09d2-43ec-bf64-5f34f49c93c8", "f15d0ef1-865e-4537-8ce2-91a36d61d95d", "f8fdfec4-2ec1-4a21-9767-0798c2756928", "fbea6404-0894-473a-930d-3028063df5f7"], "title": "Sound predictive race detection in polynomial time", "venue": "symposium on principles of programming languages", "year": 2012, "id": "530c44fc-b042-4fba-83d5-7828bc097474"}

The experimental results show that Concept Search performs at least as well as syntactic search, improving the quality of results as a function of the amount of available semantics.", "authors": ["Fausto Giunchiglia", "Uladzimir Kharkevich", "Ilya Zaihrayeu"], "n_citation": 82, "references": ["1b978417-c775-4777-bad6-ee3ee15f2025", "1ff160fa-95f5-45e3-ae45-75df914472db", "2136d05d-36b3-45fd-9dc2-eb54357dd650", "215e0488-02d7-4f1d-a834-5488cb624064", "2616451f-9c95-4137-8868-459a58df74e5", "4d9863de-7aac-4f76-9c24-bfc5333ba3bd", "5ba7f94c-6f44-4ee6-8cb6-8f11b8482eec", "5ea3f9f9-f0d0-4e56-9ff6-53416426b5bf", "68453f24-4276-4d0c-b37e-19d23af549be", "6b556b52-df8a-4587-bc75-9d3730b87a70", "8a474872-409e-4467-ae66-7c952f8d1afb", "917e92a9-148a-483e-93c0-ca1edf901ab4", "92f56c04-e870-4860-9696-1d2a7345f20c", "a657461c-9ef0-43b5-bebe-a1d03fc24013", "ac14afe6-de4d-4056-b2ac-0f6e36f369a2", "ae3d3500-1b4c-454c-b922-dcb571c49e1b", "d28665ed-c1f4-4652-ae5a-efd754e643a7", "f0bbf333-f4b4-403a-8dff-e743dfe9e0d2"], "title": "Concept Search", "venue": "european semantic web conference", "year": 2009, "id": "133ea406-fe61-4b95-a14c-9fdb2c09e3e1"}
{"abstract": "This paper introduces a technique to identify requirements discordances among stakeholders. This technique is validated in experiments. An extended version of the goal-oriented requirements elicitation method, named attributed goal-oriented analysis (AGORA), and its supporting tool are used. Two types of requirements discordances among stakeholders are defined: the first arises from the different interpretations by the stakeholders and the second is the result of different evaluations of preferences. Discordances are detected by the preference matrices in AGORA. Each preference matrix represents both preferences of each stakeholder and the estimated preferences of other stakeholders. A supporting tool for the AGORA method was developed. This tool is a groupware that seamlessly combines face-to-face meetings for goal elicitation and distributed individual sessions for scoring preference values. The experimental results showed that the proposed classification of discordances was sound and that the occurrences of the requirements discordances could be detected by preference matrices.", "authors": ["Haruhiko Kaiya", "Daisuke Shinbara", "Jinichi Kawano", "Motoshi Saeki"], "n_citation": 54, "references": ["00e032e8-1382-4f17-828a-39149adc2da5", "05e81755-56d0-4bc3-baed-2987db5fb97f", "2134bf3b-fd89-4724-90ce-5993b4fa3218", "2a7f26a2-8e99-4435-8f5e-e556882d1f52", "3ad91510-3933-4a95-933a-3cc5bfe36a10", "3d1fe380-7d41-4152-a625-dc45aecf33d2", "3d9d7f92-5a27-4b15-9458-2047f00ea0ad", "5654f55a-9362-4724-b39a-56d082f97360", "640aec73-27b3-445b-96d5-5107a6ee754c", "6439dd9a-dfc4-4db3-b404-ad654a734527", "69220232-821f-4e21-8d99-3decfb2f9da6", "70f089ea-a1c6-4564-bfbf-27f75b5876c4", "75d03451-c5ab-42ff-a507-c8dbf1a69828", "7f2ab301-5d2f-47c9-823d-e23a88c49948", "8f812ed9-e8f8-4b4b-aa6d-c78aaf3722fd", "a826417f-5157-4e14-9aee-7de9cf70a75a", "a999336c-18dc-4a02-87c8-6194c53c085a", "b2726fa1-0282-4075-90ad-930dcaf97ff1", "c78dbbf3-5dff-4e34-91b5-8ecd5837118a", "d98cb2a7-0f1e-40ab-b271-8dcff8d2cbc2", "d9e085da-c3a8-4133-bf74-6ea4c6d41a9d", "e86e07bf-eabb-4f69-b719-691d60be50f1", "f3f23722-f45a-4192-843c-953b80d2b877", "f59ace34-5166-4373-a8f7-995f6eb645d0", "ff054afb-c818-4a8a-b279-316bd811333c"], "title": "Improving the detection of requirements discordances among stakeholders", "venue": "Requirements Engineering", "year": 2005, "id": "9a573e33-2d02-47ba-a8e8-7b1935f166ab"}

{"abstract": "Service compositions need to continuously self- adapt to cope with unexpected failures. In this context adaptation becomes a fundamental requirement that must be elicited along with the other functional and non functional requirements. Beside modelling, effective adaptation also demands means to trigger it at runtime as soon as the actual behavior of the composition deviates from stated requirements. This paper extends traditional goal models with adaptive goals to support continuous adaptation. Goals become live, runtime entities whose satisfaction level is dynamically updated. Furthermore, boundary infringement triggers adaptation capabilities. The paper also provides a methodology to trace goals onto the underlying composition, assess goals satisfaction at runtime, and activate adaptation consequently.

A blocking constraint models the absence of storage capacity between machines, while a no-wait constraint occurs when two consecutive operations in a job must be processed without any interruption. We formulate the problem by means of a generalization of the disjunctive graph of Roy and Sussman, that we call an alternative graph, and investigate the applicability to the blocking and no-wait cases of some of the most effective ideas from the literature on the job shop with unlimited buffers. We show that several key properties, used to design heuristic procedures, do not hold in the blocking and no-wait cases, while some of the most effective ideas used to develop branch and bound algorithms can be easily extended.

This paper introduces ArgoSPE, a tool for the performance evaluation of software systems in the first stages of the life-cycle.

The theory behind the tool, i.e. the underlying SPE process, has been presented in previous papers and consists in translating some performance annotated UML diagrams into SPN models. Therefore, ArgoSPE prevents software engineers to model with SPN since they are obtained as a by-product of their UML models.

Our results encompass three formulations of the discrete multi-robot path planning problem, including a variant that allows synchronous rotations of robots along fully occupied, disjoint cycles on the graph. Allowing rotation of robots provides a more natural model for multi-robot path planning because robots can communicate.#R##N##R##N#Our optimality objectives are to minimize the total arrival time, the makespan (last arrival time), and the total distance. On the structure side, we show that, in general, these objectives demonstrate a pairwise Pareto optimal structure and cannot be simultaneously optimized. On the computational complexity side, we extend previous work and show that, regardless of the underlying multi-robot path planning problem, these objectives are all intractable to compute. In particular, our NP-hardness proof for the time optimal versions, based on a minimal and direct reduction from the 3-satisfiability problem, shows that these problems remain NP-hard even when there are only two groups of robots (i.e. robots within each group are interchangeable).", "authors": ["Jingjin Yu", "Steven M.

{"abstract": "This paper shows that the collection of identities which hold in the algebra N of the natural numbers with constant zero, and binary operations of sum and maximum is not finitely based. Moreover, it is proven that, for every n, the equations in at most n variables that hold in N do not form an equational basis. As a stepping stone in the proof of these facts, several results of independent interest are obtained. In particular, explicit descriptions of the free algebras in the variety generated by N are offered. Such descriptions are based upon a geometric characterization of the equations that hold in N, which also yields that the equational theory of N is decidable in exponential time.", "authors": ["Luca Aceto", "Zolt\u00e1n \u00c9sik", "Anna Ing\u00f3lfsd\u00f3ttir"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["176fafdd-6378-4243-93b7-ddc6ae4b6d42", "17947ae7-65df-4217-b029-789523c509fd", "18c93e26-9d63-4cb0-ab68-d3ee37d05e60", "2be66f16-0f59-47f9-abaf-0466275f376c", "2d7b10d5-6778-462f-9028-8943dc986385", "402abf59-c58e-4029-a44f-ca2741ad18bc", "86718b68-beb2-4201-8bce-845a80302bd2", "b7a23657-8827-4e82-863a-3233602dabb9", "fcdc6fcd-0f4d-4127-ab1c-dd1bffbb65ac"], "title": "The max-plus algebra of the natural numbers has no finite equational basis", "venue": "Theoretical Computer Science", "year": 2003, "id": "e203bb5a-5d06-4fbe-ba39-9d5d0e6272be"}
{"abstract": "Model checking is an automated technique that can be used to determine whether a system satisfies certain required properties. The typical approach to verifying properties of software components is to check them for all possible environments. In reality, however, a component is only required to satisfy properties in specific environments. Unless these environments are formally characterized and used during verification (assume-guarantee paradigm), the results returned by verification can be overly pessimistic. This work defines a framework that brings a new dimension to model checking of software components. When checking a component against a property, our model checking algorithms return one of the following three results: the component satisfies a property for any environment; the component violates the property for any environment; or finally, our algorithms generate an assumption that characterizes exactly those environments in which the component satisfies its required property.

{"abstract": "An image based system and process for rendering novel views of a real or synthesized 3D scene based on a series of concentric mosaics depicting the scene. In one embodiment, each concentric mosaic represents a collection of consecutive slit images of the surrounding 3D scene taken from a different viewpoint tangent to a circle on a plane within the scene. Novel views from viewpoints within circular regions of the aforementioned circle plane defined by the concentric mosaics are rendered using these concentric mosaics. Specifically, a slit image can be identified by a ray originating at its viewpoint on the circle plane and extending toward the longitudinal midline of the slit image. Each of the rays associated with the slit images needed to construct a novel view will either coincide with one of the rays associated with a previously captured slit image, or it will pass between two of the concentric circles on the circle plane. If it coincides, then the previously captured slit image associated with the coinciding ray can be used directly to construct part of the novel view. If the ray passes between two of the concentric circles of the plane, then the needed slit image is interpolated using the two previously captured slit images associated with the rays originating from the adjacent concentric circles that are parallel to the non-coinciding ray. If the objects in the 3D scene are close to the camera, depth correction is applied to reduce image distortion for pixels located above and below the circle plane. In another embodiment, a single camera is used to capture a sequence of images. Each image includes image data that has a ray direction associated therewith. To render an image at a novel viewpoint, multiple ray directions from the novel viewpoint are chosen. Image data is combined from the sequence of images by selecting image data that has a ray direction substantially aligning with the ray direction from the novel viewpoint.", "authors": ["Heung-Yeung Shum", "Li-wei He"], "n_citation": 686, "references": ["026b6d74-fa40-42db-a16a-79b2861f7907", "09410999-540a-409b-870c-d355c08e3619", "0bdb9407-9183-47b4-b08a-e2bcde58c0a6", "0e3c573b-8cfc-44b7-9582-0bd52924d470", "0ff7c995-1ad2-4b55-9a38-ab8a1192313c", "33fe8461-d465-4487-b9fa-8270a2d5865f", "38183178-e640-4673-9d89-3227f3816d12", "424b58a8-4f48-4fed-b532-4fba374e3c0c", "4670d118-657f-44b5-8cb6-bbbf48ec14b9", "4ccd0131-897c-40dd-aae6-2e5f6b269fa4", "4e08f48e-54b3-4056-add1-407d3266edce", "61624e74-a77b-4941-bf7b-8b7aa6a7a035", "635086b9-730c-4aa5-bbe2-e63fa7ad01b8", "637941c6-4a34-4c31-ab45-d163cd91bea1", "6b1081f7-c64a-45af-bdeb-018e8efcb097", "6edb79e7-e337-4163-9e33-c77daa1adb4c", "7e598ce4-7739-42dd-8761-eb8984ed2b19", "80246878-7728-43e0-a293-02ab79571d12", "87a3e0c6-9219-41ee-8638-ea7a86fb8ef3", "8ac30372-c1ac-48bc-8370-cc550fc41d91", "9d96d55b-65a1-4872-9960-994fe14fd0e4", "b5a9cb8e-8429-48f5-afbc-ac0456f82525", "c05717ef-0cd5-4f66-b355-c27cc584c286", "c18f4630-af32-42b6-aa66-810d275b2981", "d8077cb7-0db4-4189-b9d6-2680e6f1846b", "e2444915-c505-4008-b2ff-3be983d4b776", "eea9bf02-5283-41b1-939a-6aceaefd5f06"], "title": "Rendering with concentric mosaics", "venue": "international conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques", "year": 1999, "id": "f8708445-57ea-4604-9aac-53054ffe4ecc"}

{"abstract": "This paper describes the RailTel system developed at LIMSI to provide vocal access to static train timetable information in French, and a field trial carried out to assess the technical adequacy of available speech technology for interactive services. The data collection system used to carry out the field trials is based on the LIMSI Mask spoken language system and runs on a Unix workstation with a high quality telephone interface. The spoken language system allows a mixed-initiative dialog where the user can provide any information at any point in time. Experienced users are thus able to provide all the information needed for database access in a single sentence, whereas less experienced users tend to provide shorter responses, allowing the system to guide them.

{"abstract": "This paper argues that a new class of bugs faced by millions of smartphones, energy bugs or  ebugs , have become increasingly prominent that already they have led to significant user frustrations. We take a first look at this emerging important technical challenge faced by the smartphones, ebugs, broadly defined as an error in the system (application, OS, hardware, firmware, external conditions or combination) that causes an  unexpected  amount of high energy consumption by the system as a whole. We first present a taxonomy of the kinds of ebugs based on mining over 39K posts (1.2M before filtering) from 4 online mobile user forum and mobile OS bug repositories. The taxonomy shows the highly diverse nature of smartphone ebugs. We then propose a roadmap towards developing a systematic diagnosing framework for debugging ebugs on smartphones.", "authors": ["Abhinav Pathak", "Y.

{"abstract": "We present an experimental study showing that soft memory errors can lead to serious security vulnerabilities in Java and .NET virtual machines, or in any system that relies on type-checking of untrusted programs as a protection mechanism. Our attack works by sending to the JVM a Java program that is designed so that almost any memory error in its address space will allow it to take control of the JVM. All conventional Java and .NET virtual machines are vulnerable to this attack. The technique of the attack is broadly applicable against other language-based security schemes such as proof-carrying code. We measured the attack on two commercial Java virtual machines: Sun's and IBM's. We show that a single-bit error in the Java program's data space can be exploited to execute arbitrary code with a probability of about 70%, and multiple-bit errors with a lower probability. Our attack is particularly relevant against smart cards or tamper-resistant computers, where the user has physical access (to the outside of the computer) and can use various means to induce faults; we have successfully used heat.

{"abstract": "The Kalman filter (KF) has been implemented as the primary integration scheme of the global positioning system (GPS) and inertial navigation systems (INS) for many land vehicle navigation and positioning applications. However, it has been reported that KF-based techniques have certain limitations, which reflect on the position error accumulation during GPS signal outages. Therefore, this article exploits the idea of incorporating artificial neural networks to develop an alternative INS/GPS integration scheme, the intelligent navigator, for next generation land vehicle navigation and positioning applications. Real land vehicle test results demonstrated the capability of using stored navigation knowledge to provide real-time reliable positioning information for stand-alone INS-based navigation for up to 20min with errors less than 16m (as compared to 2.6km in the case of the KF). For relatively short GPS outages, the KF was superior to the intelligent navigator for up to 30s outages. In contrast, the intelligent navigator was superior to the KF when the length of GPS outages was extended to 90s. The average improvement of the intelligent navigator reached 60% in the latter scenario. The results presented in this article strongly indicate the potential of including the intelligent navigator as the core algorithm for INS/GPS integrated land vehicle navigation systems.", "authors": ["Kai-Wei Chiang", "Yun-Wen Huang"], "n_citation": 21, "references": ["85a01450-36cc-41a8-b12f-8baf80c3bde6", "f2c6cef9-75f2-4b24-8351-080159c05721"], "title": "An intelligent navigator for seamless INS/GPS integrated land vehicle navigation applications", "venue": "soft computing", "year": 2008, "id": "eda1efd6-4af9-4830-8a54-e16506d093de"}

The existence of a member of the introduced family of parametrized robust control invariant sets can be verified by solving a tractable convex optimization problem in the linear convex case, which reduces to the standard linear or convex quadratic programme in the linear polytopic case. The developed method can also be utilized to detect and obtain an implicit representation of local control Lyapunov functions in the linear convex case from the solution of a single and tractable convex optimization problem. The offered method permits for the computation of polytopic robust control invariant sets and local control Lyapunov functions of indirectly controlled and limited complexity in the linear polytopic case.", "authors": ["Sasa V.

The original peer prediction method is incentive compatible for any number of agents n \u2265 2, but relies on a common prior, shared by all agents and the mechanism. The Bayesian Truth Serum (BTS) relaxes this assumption. While BTS still assumes that agents share a common prior, this prior need not be known to the mechanism. However, BTS is only incentive compatible for a large enough number of agents, and the particular number of agents required is uncertain because it depends on this private prior. In this paper, we present a robust BTS for the elicitation of binary information which is incentive compatible for every n \u2265 3, taking advantage of a particularity of the quadratic scoring rule. The robust BTS is the first peer prediction mechanism to provide strict incentive compatibility for every n \u2265 3 without relying on knowledge of the common prior.

{"abstract": "Abstract : The proliferation of information on the world wide web has made the personalization of this information space a necessity. One possible approach to web personalization is to mine typical user profiles from the vast amount of historical data stored in access logs. In the absence of any a priori knowledge, unsupervised classification or clustering methods seem to be ideally suited to analyze the semi-structured log data of user accesses. In this paper, we define the notion of a user session , as well as a dissimilarity measure between two web sessions that captures the organization of a web site. To extract a user access profile, we cluster the user sessions based on the pair-wise dissimilarities using a robust fuzzy clustering algorithm that we have developed. We report the results of experiments with our algorithm and show that this leads to extraction of interesting user profiles. We also show that it outperforms association rule based approaches for this task.", "authors": ["Anupam Joshi", "Raghu Krishnapuram"], "n_citation": 183, "references": ["0200e3cf-fd64-4af8-b35c-d036bcf213ee", "0322a45e-87ac-48c2-95ec-2f3019687dbf", "040fc02d-183c-49fc-ad91-a7daf1d98718", "30354d92-9f05-4adf-aedf-8017b18eebe1", "4108c4f4-a702-498b-86c4-adbbf994ebd5", "53c1a55b-36dc-4f3a-bcba-88c7b6c4b513", "64eff64f-132c-49c7-a8ff-647a5dc2e734", "714bf6ea-6a85-4c82-95f0-9164236bf8b2", "834bbaf8-141a-4ca6-8595-7804dfbe0e2e", "93d26321-c26e-402c-99cd-5d423a200961", "bdb8d83d-1771-4399-b593-d43be5a9f892", "cbb4a4b7-09e2-4bd9-98b0-2c6c25cbf05c", "e49d47ee-5ab6-4dab-85e1-78b5d46e2f93", "ec9530c1-ff1a-482f-8238-2024c30e36bd", "f64cbdde-c708-4425-9fd5-20fdc9d6fba5"], "title": "On Mining Web Access Logs", "venue": "international conference on management of data", "year": 2000, "id": "834de5c0-d266-4fd7-bcf9-f47c44dd01f2"}

{"abstract": "We propose an approach to address data uncertainty for discrete optimization and network flow problems that allows controlling the degree of conservatism of the solution, and is computationally tractable both practically and theoretically. In particular, when both the cost coefficients and the data in the constraints of an integer programming problem are subject to uncertainty, we propose a robust integer programming problem of moderately larger size that allows controlling the degree of conservatism of the solution in terms of probabilistic bounds on constraint violation. When only the cost coefficients are subject to uncertainty and the problem is a 0\u22121 discrete optimization problem on n variables, then we solve the robust counterpart by solving at most n+1 instances of the original problem. Thus, the robust counterpart of a polynomially solvable 0\u22121 discrete optimization problem remains polynomially solvable. In particular, robust matching, spanning tree, shortest path, matroid intersection, etc. are polynomially solvable. We also show that the robust counterpart of an NP-hard \u03b1-approximable 0\u22121 discrete optimization problem, remains \u03b1-approximable.

{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#In this paper, we present an integrated framework of on-line motion blending for locomotion generation. We first provide a novel scheme for incremental timewarping, which always guarantees that the time goes forward. Combining the idea of motion blending with that of posture rearrangement, we introduce a motion transition graph to address on-line motion blending and transition simultaneously. Guided by a stream of motion specifications, our motion synthesis scheme moves from node to node in an on-line manner while blending a motion at a node and generating a transition motion at an edge. For smooth on-line motion transition, we also attach a set of example transition motions to an edge. To represent similar postures consistently, we exploit the inter-frame coherency embedded in the input motion specification. Finally, we provide a comprehensive solution to on-line motion retargeting by integrating existing techniques.

{"abstract": "This paper is concerned with global asymptotic output synchronization in networks of identical feedback systems. Using an operator theoretic approach based on an incremental small gain theorem, the method reformulates the synchronization problem as one of achieving incremental stability using a coupling operator that plays the role of an incrementally stabilizing feedback. In this way, conditions on static or dynamic coupling operators that achieve output synchronization of nodes of arbitrary structure are derived. These conditions lead to a methodology for the construction of coupling architectures that ensure output synchronization of a wide range of systems.

{"abstract": "Motivation: Binary datasets represent a compact and simple way to store data about the relationships between a group of objects and their possible properties. In the last few years, different biclustering algorithms have been specially developed to be applied to binary datasets. Several approaches based on matrix factorization, suffix trees or divide-and-conquer techniques have been proposed to extract useful biclusters from binary data, and these approaches provide information about the distribution of patterns and intrinsic correlations.#R##N##R##N#Results: A novel approach to extracting biclusters from binary datasets, BiBit, is introduced here. The results obtained from different experiments with synthetic data reveal the excellent performance and the robustness of BiBit to density and size of input data. Also, BiBit is applied to a central nervous system embryonic tumor gene expression dataset to test the quality of the results. A novel gene expression preprocessing methodology, based on expression level layers, and the selective search performed by BiBit, based on a very fast bit-pattern processing technique, provide very satisfactory results in quality and computational cost. The power of biclustering in finding genes involved simultaneously in different cancer processes is also shown. Finally, a comparison with Bimax, one of the most cited binary biclustering algorithms, shows that BiBit is faster while providing essentially the same results.#R##N##R##N#Availability: The source and binary codes, the datasets used in the experiments and the results can be found at: http://www.upo.es/eps/bigs/BiBit.html#R##N##R##N#Contact: dsrodbae@upo.es#R##N##R##N#Supplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.", "authors": ["Domingo S.

{"abstract": "We propose a novel technique for statically verifying the strings generated by a program. The verification is conducted by encoding the program in Monadic Second-Order Logic (M2L). We use M2L to describe constraints among program variables and to abstract built-in string operations. Once we encode a program in M2L, a theorem prover for M2L, such as MONA, can automatically check if a string generated by the program satisfies a given specification, and if not, exhibit a counterexample. With this approach, we can naturally encode relationships among strings, accounting also for cases in which a program manipulates strings using indices. In addition, our string analysis is path sensitive in that it accounts for the effects of string and Boolean comparisons, as well as regular-expression matches.   We have implemented our string-analysis algorithm, and used it to augment an industrial security analysis for Web applications by automatically detecting and verifying  sanitizers ---methods that eliminate malicious patterns from untrusted strings, making those strings safe to use in security-sensitive operations. On the 8 benchmarks we analyzed, our string analyzer discovered 128 previously unknown sanitizers, compared to 71 sanitizers detected by a previously presented string analysis.", "authors": ["Takaaki Tateishi", "Marco Pistoia", "Omer Tripp"], "n_citation": 34, "references": ["1b401d18-309b-4e28-9e80-acee58d829dc", "2448f6ce-230a-495c-8cab-21a8bf2865eb", "281999d1-f75f-430c-8d8c-fa79fbf04fa2", "312236d2-d0ef-4802-b85b-407cd3463dc3", "3127f724-df75-488c-9c85-3e60a250adcd", "3317d1f5-f673-4847-874a-74861a51294f", "3367b661-cad3-4eec-afca-fc7172152b2b", "350e165f-d7e9-4e99-8165-a299569d1255", "3c76df3c-3da8-434e-9325-5b66d3ee7600", "4258fc2b-f252-431b-8ac2-e223ebc99a8e", "48ca6fd9-8a4c-418f-a944-bd5b70f9cbaa", "48df77c7-2fd3-4cd2-979f-073d858808c9", "5691525e-0309-49a3-9955-6f409375c9d8", "5b03270b-2d1a-45ad-b0bc-dfa4e457d61c", "63570c22-0a71-4f6d-9c18-bb338e7686c9", "6995737b-b8e3-49ea-aa1f-e97bf0684b1e", "6a5e8bc9-987b-4b98-9b16-7dcfd574a225", "7197911e-a176-4038-a92d-a5e842653ddd", "933f1326-9bf7-4f2e-bc22-e806064b70c0", "a1b64c9f-0773-4e0b-89eb-bfc6c824eef0", "de869aee-9206-4d68-9dc0-2cfaf6f4fb36", "e2705eba-32c3-4bb7-9836-3fe64d77b8cb", "f7e15a81-537c-475f-8dd2-246945efb4c1", "fe0623a1-45fe-48c6-b0b7-9a2ad8313a53"], "title": "Path- and index-sensitive string analysis based on monadic second-order logic", "venue": "international symposium on software testing and analysis", "year": 2011, "id": "adc2966f-119a-4d54-9137-3351b6fde1cd"}

{"abstract": "We present an original approach for motion-based video retrieval involving partial query. More precisely, we propose a unified statistical framework allowing us to simultaneously extract entities of interest in video shots and supply the associated content-based characterization, which can be used to satisfy partial queries. It relies on the analysis of motion activity in video sequences based on a non-parametric probabilistic modeling of motion information. Areas comprising relevant types of motion activity are extracted from a Markovian region-level labeling applied to the adjacency graph of an initial block-based partition of the image.

{"abstract": "Programming by demonstration enables users to easily personalize their applications, automating repetitive tasks simply by executing a few examples. We formalize programming by demonstration as a machine learning problem: given the changes in the application state that result from the user's demonstrated actions, learn the general program that maps from one application state to the next. We present a methodology for learning in this space of complex functions. First we extend version spaces to learn arbitrary functions, not just concepts. Then we introduce the version space algebra, a method for composing simpler version spaces to construct more complex spaces. Finally, we apply our version space algebra to the text-editing domain and describe an implemented system called SMARTedit that learns repetitive text-editing procedures by example. We evaluate our approach by measuring the number of examples required for the system to learn a procedure that works on the remainder of examples, and by an informal user study measuring the effort users spend using our system versus performing the task by hand. The results show that SMARTedit is capable of generalizing correctly from as few as one or two examples, and that users generally save a significant amount of effort when completing tasks with SMARTedit's help.", "authors": ["Tessa A.

Finding position without the aid of GPS in each node of an ad hoc network is important in cases where GPS is either not accessible, or not practical to use due to power, form factor or line of sight conditions. Position would also enable routing in sufficiently isotropic large networks, without the use of large routing tables.

In particular, we show that a single k-ary recursive constant-depth determinate clause is learnable. Two-clause programs consisting of one learnable recursive clause and one constant-depth determinate nonrecursive clause are also learnable, if an additional \"basecase\" oracle is assumed. These results immediately imply the pac-learnability of these classes. Although these classes of learnable recursive programs are very constrained, it is shown in a companion paper that they are maximally general, in that generalizing either class in any natural way leads to a computationally difficult learning problem.

{"abstract": "The utilization of Interactive Multimedia Documents (IMDs) has been largely addressed in several fields such as education, medicine, etc. since these documents can be distributed and accessed over the World-Wide-Web. In this context, the W3C standard Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) has been proposed for the presentation of IMD's over the Web. However, the flexibility of the temporal model of SMIL 2.0 allows the author to describe temporal synchronization relationships that potentially can not be resolved during the presentation of the document, known as temporal inconsistencies. For this reason, an approach that enables to detect and correct these inconsistencies is needed.This paper presents a formal approach for the verification, scheduling and presentation of consistent SMIL 2.0 documents based on the RT-LOTOS formal description technique.

To combat this, the World Health Organization (WHO) and UNICEF developed the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) treatment algorithms.   In Tanzania, IMCI is the national policy for the treatment of childhood illness. This paper describes e-IMCI, a system for administering the IMCI protocol using a PDA.

{"abstract": "A recent paper categorizes classifier learning algorithms according to their sensitivity to a common type of sample selection bias where the chance of an example being selected into the training sample depends on its feature vector x but not (directly) on its class label y. A classifier learner is categorized as \"local\" if it is insensitive to this type of sample selection bias, otherwise, it is considered \"global\". In that paper, the true model is not clearly distinguished from the model that the algorithm outputs. In their discussion of Bayesian classifiers, logistic regression and hard-margin SVMs, the true model (or the model that generates the true class label for every example) is implicitly assumed to be contained in the model space of the learner, and the true class probabilities and model estimated class probabilities are assumed to asymptotically converge as the training data set size increases. However, in the discussion of naive Bayes, decision trees and soft-margin SVMs, the model space is assumed not to contain the true model, and these three algorithms are instead argued to be \"global learners\". We argue that most classifier learners may or may not be affected by sample selection bias; this depends on the dataset as well as the heuristics or inductive bias implied by the learning algorithm and their appropriateness to the particular dataset.", "authors": ["Wei Fan", "Ian Davidson", "Bianca Zadrozny", "Philip S.

{"abstract": "The performance of automatic speech recognition is severely degraded in the presence of noise or reverberation. Much research has been undertaken on noise robustness. In contrast, the problem of the recognition of reverberant speech has received far less attention and remains very challenging. In this paper, we use a dereverberation method to reduce reverberation prior to recognition. Such a preprocessor may remove most reverberation effects. However, it often introduces distortion, causing a dynamic mismatch between speech features and the acoustic model used for recognition. Model adaptation could be used to reduce this mismatch. However, conventional model adaptation techniques assume a static mismatch and may therefore not cope well with a dynamic mismatch arising from dereverberation. This paper proposes a novel adaptation scheme that is capable of managing both static and dynamic mismatches. We introduce a parametric model for variance adaptation that includes static and dynamic components in order to realize an appropriate interconnection between dereverberation and a speech recognizer. The model parameters are optimized using adaptive training implemented with the expectation maximization algorithm. An experiment using the proposed method with reverberant speech for a reverberation time of 0.5 s revealed that it was possible to achieve an 80% reduction in the relative error rate compared with the recognition of dereverberated speech (word error rate of 31%), and the final error rate was 5.4%, which was obtained by combining the proposed variance compensation and MLLR adaptation.", "authors": ["Marc Delcroix", "Tomohiro Nakatani", "Shinji Watanabe"], "n_citation": 67, "references": ["2161be2b-6499-435f-bc5c-265d37e8a330", "2d36f6fa-350e-4853-b725-5f144766031a", "312b9f7e-b98f-4f86-866e-b067a664e7d0", "33be06df-ccdf-4a41-812c-c69e616a8185", "355e92ee-5ff6-4fe3-a1ef-e9fef062ac60", "4615a612-d2cd-46ba-a7d1-0c896feaebc1", "56ee64d4-483c-42ee-98f5-660f8cc81ff3", "6f339396-22e8-41d0-a2f7-ff4f78665b45", "7a3a5d3a-a158-4baf-801c-993efe62015f", "8dd291b7-aed0-4a52-9688-d2b7a2835ecf", "8fe51597-95f3-40b1-9dd4-0a8fbe58f6d7", "9e0a5098-0ad9-42a8-9a85-7c9c3674b517", "9e3a2873-0a82-4c67-ba2f-9bfc159b556b", "9f5ee9a6-83f0-452b-9a7a-ffbef3dd0e9f", "a67d52e8-c14a-407f-993a-88cce53b9124", "ba8a80b1-9367-487a-a440-7613d5abda13", "c169fc39-6993-42e7-a9e3-e6c14a6c01b8", "d3225189-8e89-4ef2-b257-c1a0b0cc6205", "d6daf0ea-d26e-49d1-af7a-c93a98d9dbcf", "e4301795-8d0f-48f0-a4e0-eac748042b17", "e6959459-618b-4334-b0f4-3b5272cc442b", "e8a6ba5f-c041-4112-84d3-896bdbf07ea3"], "title": "Static and Dynamic Variance Compensation for Recognition of Reverberant Speech With Dereverberation Preprocessing", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Audio, Speech, and Language Processing", "year": 2009, "id": "d12f23f7-d542-4b1e-8c87-6c819bad80e6"}

{"abstract": "In the near future, semiconductor technology will allow the integration of multiple processors on a chip or multichip-module (MCM). In this paper we investigate the architecture and partitioning of resources between processors and cache memory for single chip and MCM-based multiprocessors. We study the performance of a cluster-based multiprocessor architecture in which processors within a cluster are tightly coupled via a shared cluster cache for various processor-cache configurations. Our results show that for parallel applications, clustering via shared caches provides an effective mechanism for increasing the total number of processors in a system, without increasing the number of invalidations. Combining these results with cost estimates for shared cluster cache implementations leads to two conclusions: 1) For a four cluster multiprocessor with single chip clusters, two processors per cluster with a smaller cache provides higher performance and better cost/performance than a single processor with a larger cache and 2) this four cluster configuration can be scaled linearly in performance by adding processors to each cluster using MCM packaging techniques.", "authors": ["Basem A.

We assume that each sensor has a maximum duty cycle and at most one sensor can communicate with a remote estimator at each time step due to the limited communication bandwidth. When a sensor is scheduled to send data, it sends the most recent  D  measurement data to the estimator. Upon receiving the measurement data from the sensors, the estimator computes the optimal estimate of the state of the process. We first present a necessary condition for a periodic sensor schedule to be optimal. Based on this necessary condition, we construct an optimal periodic schedule that minimizes the estimation error at the estimator and at the same time satisfies the energy and communication bandwidth constraints.

{"abstract": "Evolutionary testing is an effective technique for automatically generating good quality test data. However, for structural testing, the technique degenerates to random testing in the presence of flag variables, which also present problems for other automated test data generation techniques. Previous work on the flag problem does not address flags assigned in loops.This paper introduces a testability transformation that transforms programs with loop--assigned flags so that existing genetic approaches can be successfully applied. It then presents empirical data demonstrating the effectiveness of the transformation. Untransformed, the genetic algorithm flounders and is unable to find a solution. Two transformations are considered. The first allows the search to find a solution.

{"abstract": "The recent design shift towards multicore processors has spawned a significant amount of research in the area of program paralleliza- tion. The future abundance of cores on a single chip requires pro- grammer and compiler intervention to increase the amount of par- allel work possible. Much of the recent work has fallen into the areas of coarse-grain parallelization: new programming models and different ways to exploit threads and data-level parallelism. This work focuses on a complementary direction, improving per- formance through automated fine-grain parallelization. The main difficulty in achieving a performance benefit from fine-grain paral- lelism is the distribution of data memory accesses across the data caches of each core. Poor choices in the placement of data ac- cesses can lead to increased memory stalls and low resource utiliza- tion. We propose a profile-guided method for partitioning mem- ory accesses across distributed data caches. First, a profile deter- mines affinity relationships between memory accesses and work- ing set characteristics of individual memory operations in the pro- gram. Next, a program-level partitioning of the memory opera- tions is performed to divide the memory accesses across the data caches. As a result, the data accesses are proactively dispersed to reduce memory stalls and improve computation parallelization. A final detailed partitioning of the computation instructions is per- formed with knowledge of the cache location of their associated data. Overall, our data partitioning reduces stall cycles by up to 51% versus data-incognizant partitioning, and has an overall speedup average of 30% over a single core processor.", "authors": ["Michael L.

{"abstract": "Multihop data delivery through vehicular ad hoc networks is complicated by the fact that vehicular networks are highly mobile and frequently disconnected. To address this issue, we adopt the idea of carry and forward, where a moving vehicle carries a packet until a new vehicle moves into its vicinity and forwards the packet. Being different from existing carry and forward solutions, we make use of predictable vehicle mobility, which is limited by traffic pattern and road layout. Based on the existing traffic pattern, a vehicle can find the next road to forward the packet to reduce the delay. We propose several vehicle-assisted data delivery (VADD) protocols to forward the packet to the best road with the lowest data-delivery delay. Experimental results show that the proposed VADD protocols outperform existing so- lutions in terms of packet-delivery ratio, data packet delay, and protocol overhead.

{"abstract": "In this paper a new method for analyzing the intrinsic dimensionality (ID) of low dimensional manifolds in high dimensional feature spaces is presented. The basic idea is to first extract a low-dimensional representation that captures the intrinsic topological structure of the input data and then to analyze this representation, i.e. to estimate the intrinsic dimensionality. Compared to previous approaches based on local PCA the method has a number of important advantages: First, it can be shown to have only linear time complexity w.r.t. the dimensionality of the input space (in contrast to the cubic complexity of the conventional approach) and hence becomes applicable even for very high dimensional input spaces. Second, it is less sensitive to noise than former approaches, and, finally, the extracted representation can be directly used for further data processing tasks including auto-association and classification. The presented method for ID estimation is illustrated on a synthetic data set. It has also been successfully applied to ID estimation of full scale image sequences, see [BS97].", "authors": ["J\u00f6rg Bruske", "Gerald Sommer"], "n_citation": 7, "references": ["1017d9d4-9a4c-423d-ad40-6d9bebbd6b31", "2541f284-dca3-47d2-a2c6-75d53ff3cebc", "43988db0-7689-4085-ba94-0e48a748b5c1", "6185086d-5fe4-4e34-bdac-29668382edc2", "7e1f006e-a166-492c-837a-14faf5b8987d", "99c7bd14-053b-496a-b43c-38e672ebcd7a", "a388da07-1608-4b15-aa08-a6cbb53be603"], "title": "An Algorithm for Intrinsic Dimensionality Estimation", "venue": "computer analysis of images and patterns", "year": 1997, "id": "aa58b9b5-af64-4d66-976c-27a9e8321cf3"}
{"abstract": "An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) protects computer networks against attacks and intrusions. One class of IDS is called signature-based network IDSs as they monitor network traffic, looking for evidence of malicious behaviour as specified in attack descriptions (referred to as signatures). Many studies report that IDSs have problems accurately identifying attacks. Therefore, it is important to precisely understand under which conditions IDSs accurately identify attacks or fail to do so. However, no systematic approach has so far been defined and used to study this problem. Recognizing that signatures in essence provide the specification of an IDS engine, studying the accuracy of an IDS engine becomes a black-box testing problem. We therefore precisely and systematically evaluate which mature testing techniques can be used (and adapted) to derive tests from IDS signatures. We experiment with those criteria on one widely used and maintained IDS and show that our approach is effective at systematically revealing problems in this IDS engine (e.g., problems that prevent the detection of attacks).", "authors": ["Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Massicotte", "Yvan Labiche"], "n_citation": 9, "references": ["01951012-cfe7-4878-9a6b-d064d349d513", "2b4c7351-c3cf-4fb8-a9ee-4feb24feab22", "344ba8f9-9aca-4a0d-a534-84cfe0baaf84", "5d8d4c0d-97fb-45f3-ae22-c64d54409e52", "66a2c34c-5578-40b8-9196-6ee4499e6011", "8958de4f-1718-46a1-a12d-6b7994742666", "8f7c1810-e017-40d6-843d-86ef4d7e8ce6", "9bc795cf-8473-4925-8052-9461424037f3", "a59be9de-2672-4f92-8ff6-636b3afbce68", "b4ad2bdb-a647-43ed-9544-41b53c80c72b", "d32bf933-23c5-4a41-9ac4-d8db22cc3b23", "d67c3b2e-ba4a-4f53-879c-1cb76f40599b", "efb77c4c-d3c2-454a-95f3-e45eaea3b991"], "title": "Specification-Based Testing of Intrusion Detection Engines Using Logical Expression Testing Criteria", "venue": "international conference on quality software", "year": 2010, "id": "725aa0be-2a16-4a31-b9ac-5bcd5ead7218"}

The state variables of such systems satisfy canonical commutation relations and are governed by linear quantum stochastic differential equations, dynamically equivalent to those of an open quantum harmonic oscillator.

This coherent quantum filtering (CQF) formulation is a simplified feedback-free version of the coherent quantum LQG control problem which remains open despite recent studies.

{"abstract": "Software safety cases encourage developers to carry out only those safety activities that actually reduce risk. In practice this is not always achieved. To help remedy this, the SSEI at the University of York has developed a set of software safety argument patterns. This paper reports on using the patterns in two real-world case studies, evaluating the patterns' use against criteria that includes flexibility, ability to reveal assurance decits and ability to focus the case on software contributions to hazards. The case studies demonstrated that the safety patterns can be applied to a range of system types regardless of the stage or type of development process, that they help limit safety case activities to those that are significant for achieving safety, and that they help developers nd assurance deficits in their safety case arguments. The case study reports discuss the difficulties of applying the patterns, particularly in the case of users who are unfamiliar with the approach, and the authors recognise in response the need for better instructional material. But the results show that as part of the development of best practice in safety, the patterns promise signicant benets to industrial safety case creators.", "authors": ["Richard Hawkins", "Kester Clegg", "Robert Alexander", "Tim Kelly"], "n_citation": 33, "references": ["2e5f21d9-098f-4345-8d26-2464f7a32c6c", "c62e1d2e-7dbd-4904-b354-8fc5c40dfc30"], "title": "Using a software safety argument pattern catalogue: two case studies", "venue": "international conference on computer safety, reliability, and security", "year": 2011, "id": "a7c89cac-4463-4f03-8221-390320029f33"}
{"abstract": "A problem that confronts the engineer desiring to use time optimal discontinuous control in a system is the determination of the loci of points in state space at which the steering functions should be switched to the opposite direction. The equations which define these loci are required for synthesis of the system controller. This paper is an exposition of an approach of R. Oldenburger and a solution of R. Bellman applied to seven examples to illustrate a method for finding these loci and to indicate the problems involved. The method works without complication for normal systems described by equations with real roots. By the approach of LaSalle, the method is extended to cover normal systems described by equations with complex roots. A final section shows how non-symmetry of steering functions can be treated in practice. The steering functions for the non-symmetric case are treated by replacing the non-symmetric steering function by the sum of a symmetric steering function and a constant which describes the degree of asymmetry.", "authors": ["R.

{"abstract": "Almost all existing controllers for nonholonomic mobile robots are designed without considering the actuator dynamics. This is because the presence of the actuator dynamics increases the complexity of the system dynamics, and makes difficult the design of the controller. In this paper, we propose a simple adaptive control approach for path tracking of uncertain nonholonomic mobile robots incorporating actuator dynamics. All parameters of robot kinematics, robot dynamics, and actuator dynamics are assumed to be uncertain. For the simple controller design, the dynamic surface control methodology is applied and extended to mobile robots that the number of inputs and outputs is different. We also adopt the adaptive control technique to treat all uncertainties and derive adaptation laws from the Lyapunov stability theory.

To date, the majority of research on QoS is systems oriented, focusing on traffic analysis, scheduling, and routing. Relatively minor attention has been paid to user-level QoS issues. It is not yet known how objective system quality relates to users' subjective perceptions of quality. This paper presents the results of quantitative experiments that establish a mapping between objective and perceived QoS in the context of Internet commerce. We also conducted focus groups to determine how contextual factors influence users' perceptions of QoS. We show that, while users' perceptions of World Wide Web QoS are influenced by a number of contextual factors, it is possible to correlate objective measures of QoS with subjective judgements made by users, and therefore influence system design. We argue that only by integrating users' requirements for QoS into system design can the utility of the future Internet be maximized.", "authors": ["Anna Bouch", "Allan Kuchinsky", "Nina Bhatti"], "n_citation": 348, "references": ["0a859a3d-323d-42b7-a501-41d9a19d0759", "25b30129-b6b7-4cc3-a516-c46edec07fae", "35a82595-350f-427c-8eac-584bb08bd0b8", "a3d748c3-2e1c-49c2-8ed3-5b3ae05e4d96"], "title": "Quality is in the eye of the beholder: meeting users' requirements for Internet quality of service", "venue": "human factors in computing systems", "year": 2000, "id": "d5458c39-42af-4203-9bd1-ca4ff3fc7c93"}
{"abstract": "Program Analysis has been a rich and fruitful field of research for many decades, and countless high quality program analysis tools have been produced by academia. Though there are some well-known examples of tools that have found their way into routine use by practitioners, a common challenge faced by researchers is knowing how to achieve broad and lasting adoption of their tools. In an effort to understand what makes a program analyzer most attractive to developers, we mounted a multi-method investigation at Microsoft. Through interviews and surveys of developers as well as analysis of defect data, we provide insight and answers to four high level research questions that can help researchers design program analyzers meeting the needs of software developers.     First, we explore what barriers hinder the adoption of program analyzers, like poorly expressed warning messages. Second, we shed light on what functionality developers want from analyzers, including the types of code issues that developers care about. Next, we answer what non-functional characteristics an analyzer should have to be widely used, how the analyzer should fit into the development process, and how its results should be reported. Finally, we investigate defects in one of Microsoft's flagship software services, to understand what types of code issues are most important to minimize, potentially through program analysis.", "authors": ["Maria Christakis", "Christian Bird"], "n_citation": 12, "references": ["135bd4c9-669c-4b6b-8130-fe9f0655033c", "32ba943a-65e6-40eb-ba14-60ea8ceb78a5", "4797000b-7893-4267-847a-50b0153ee150", "4ae38b6c-7b4f-4425-9c2b-6f68c80c7568", "5779e1ac-bf37-45ee-9303-2efe19a768d5", "5dd15be7-5412-434c-8dee-043ba97503a5", "82fc5451-bb94-4a72-8ef5-bd5d1b723f6f", "9198f950-e354-48ee-a05c-739fdc092071", "944a4f89-8c52-4ac3-a866-f9a3765040a7", "955bbfe9-9a4d-4dd4-bf44-dc1ae1007be6", "9d6c4721-e5d8-4080-9a2d-ceb22f9c5fe9", "ab336aa6-bfb4-48a4-bf02-cd79ca826581", "ac0280e6-092c-4755-8eab-c4b656975a80", "c35c85df-b2a8-4064-bfce-0017828fd45d", "c6c01af2-d597-4056-bec3-9a3e16facd80", "d4031e12-fa4f-4e4c-960b-d3e08fbfd9ea", "e2d0682b-6706-4c14-9e62-e9b9c2c78a45", "e9a3f5be-0447-4fad-915e-2fc5e6f2d905", "f9ccceab-0800-4712-88c1-ed4ea32e658c", "fa5da786-b26e-44e1-8f1a-d0c05249423d"], "title": "What developers want and need from program analysis: an empirical study", "venue": "automated software engineering", "year": 2016, "id": "2244cd20-59ef-411e-a217-a6946611a5ec"}

{"abstract": "In multiple attribute decision analysis (MADA), one often needs to deal with both numerical data and qualitative information with uncertainty. It is essential to properly represent and use uncertain information to conduct rational decision analysis. Based on a multilevel evaluation framework, an evidential reasoning (ER) approach has been developed for supporting such decision analysis, the kernel of which is an ER algorithm developed on the basis of the framework and the evidence combination rule of the Dempster-Shafer (D-S) theory. The approach has been applied to engineering design selection, organizational self-assessment, safety and risk assessment, and supplier assessment. In this paper, the fundamental features of the ER approach are investigated. New schemes for weight normalization and basic probability assignments are proposed. The original ER approach is further developed to enhance the process of aggregating attributes with uncertainty. Utility intervals are proposed to describe the impact of ignorance on decision analysis. Several properties of the new ER approach are explored, which lay the theoretical foundation of the ER approach. A numerical example of a motorcycle evaluation problem is examined using the ER approach.

More specifically, we show that there exists a reduction from an NP-hard problem to the approximate closest vector problem such that the lattice depends only on the size of the original problem, and the specific instance is encoded solely in the target vector. It follows that there are lattices for which the closest vector problem cannot be approximated within factors \u03b3 < \u221a5/3 in polynomial time, no matter how the lattice is represented, unless NP is equal to P (or NP is contained in P/poly, in case of nonuniform sequences of lattices).

Both organizations developed prototypes, but only small design changes were prototyped and tested early in development. Innovative changes were evaluated late, when resistance to iteration was great.

In this model compensation and retrying are used for recovery purposes. However, since such executions may no longer consist of atomic transactions, a correctness criterion that ensures that transactions see consistent database states is necessary. A commit protocol and a concurrency control scheme that ensures that all generated schedules are correct are also presented. The commit protocol eliminates the problem of blocking, which is characteristics of the standard 2PC protocol. The concurrency control protocol can be used in any MDBS environment irrespective of the concurrency control protocol followed by the local DBMSs in order to ensure serializability. >", "authors": ["Sharad Mehrotra", "Rajeev Rastogi", "Abraham Silberschatz", "Henry F.

{"abstract": "A wide variety of sensors have been incorporated into a spectrum of wireless sensor network (WSN) platforms, providing flexible sensing capability over a large number of low-power and inexpensive nodes. Traditional signal processing algorithms, however, often prove too complex for energy-and-cost-effective WSN nodes. This study explores how to design efficient sensing and classification algorithms that achieve reliable sensing performance on energy-and-cost effective hardware without special powerful nodes in a continuously changing physical environment. We present the detection and classification system in a cutting-edge surveillance sensor network, which classifies vehicles, persons, and persons carrying ferrous objects, and tracks these targets with a maximum error in velocity of 15%. Considering the demanding requirements and strict resource constraints, we design a hierarchical classification architecture that naturally distributes sensing and computation tasks at different levels of the system. Such a distribution allows multiple sensors to collaborate on a sensor node, and the detection and classification results to be continuously refined at different levels of the WSN. This design enables reliable detection and classification without involving high-complexity computation, reduces network traffic, and emphasizes resilience and adaptation to the realistic environment. We evaluate the system with performance data collected from outdoor experiments and field assessments. Based on the experience acquired and lessons learned when developing this system, we abstract common issues and introduce several guidelines which can direct future development of detection and classification solutions based on WSNs.", "authors": ["Lin Gu", "Dong Jia", "Pascal A.

{"abstract": "A new inference control, called random sample queries, is proposed for safeguarding confidential data in on-line statistical databases. The random sample queries control deals directly with the basic principle of compromise by making it impossible for a questioner to control precisely the formation of query sets. Queries for relative frequencies and averages are computed using random samples drawn from the query sets. The sampling strategy permits the release of accurate and timely statistics and can be implemented at very low cost. Analysis shows the relative error in the statistics decreases as the query set size increases; in contrast, the effort required to compromise increases with the query set size due to large absolute errors.

{"abstract": "The efficient query and extraction of web data is often difficult, because web data does not conform to any data organization standard. In addition, the development of web search technology is still at a relatively early stage. Search engines provide only primitive data query capabilities, and require a detailed syntactic specification to retrieve relevant data. Furthermore, web data exists in a myriad of formats including PDF documents, images, and sound clips that are difficult to be queried. This research proposes a smart web query (SWQ) method for the semantic retrieval of web data. The SWQ method uses domain semantics represented as context ontologies to specify and formulate appropriate web queries to search. This method also relies on semantic search filters to identify and rank relevant web pages semi-automatically. Unlike traditional ontologies that are structured in a hierarchy, terms and their relationships that pertain to a particular domain are organized with a flexible structure by the context ontologies. An SWQ engine is being developed to test the proposed method. Financial trading (e.g. stocks, bonds, unit trusts) is adapted as an example domain (i.e., context) to test and validate the SWQ method and engine.", "authors": ["Roger H. L.

{"abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of multiobjective control for a class of Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy singularly perturbed systems. Based on a linear matrix inequality (LMI) approach, a state feedback controller that depends on the singular perturbation parameter epsiv is developed such that: 1) the  H   infin  performance of the resulting closed-loop system is less than or equal to some prescribed value; 2) the closed-loop poles of each local system are within a prespecified LMI stability region; and 3) for a given upper bound epsivmacr for the singular perturbation parameter epsiv, both 1) and 2) are guaranteed for all epsiv isin [0,epsivmacr.] It is shown that the epsiv-dependent controller is well defined for any epsiv isin [0,epsivmacr], and can be reduced to an epsiv-independent one if epsiv is sufficiently small.

{"abstract": "During the last decade, literature about work has increasingly focused on the importance of collective communication, tacit knowledge, and group activities. The idea of designing computer support for group-based work activities, which we loosely call 'cooperative work', is a useful and challenging one, for it represents a break from design approaches that focused on centralized and bureaucratic systems of communication and control.  To get a clearer idea of the meaning of cooperative work, this article will look at historical patterns of work organization and management strategies. It will contrast user-centered concepts of cooperative work, with the idea of seeing cooperative work in the context of democracy in the workplace. The focus on workplace democracy has been a main theme in the Scandinavian systems tradition. The article uses the Scandinavian tradition, with its roots in a Labor Process Approach as a way to analyze the meaning of cooperation for workplace democracy and its implication for the design of computer support.", "authors": ["Joan Greenbaum"], "n_citation": 21, "references": [], "title": "In search of cooperation: an historical analysis of work organization and management strategies", "venue": "conference on computer supported cooperative work", "year": 1988, "id": "7a4f1507-d0d9-4aa3-9083-5c3f20133616"}
{"abstract": "Although there is an increasing amount of experimental research on learning concepts expressed in first-order logic, there are still relatively few formal results on the polynomial learnability of first-order representations from examples. Most previous analyses in the pac-model have focused on subsets of Prolog, and only a few highly restricted subsets have been shown to be learnable. In this paper, we will study instead the learnability of the restricted first-order logics known as \u201cdescription logics\u201d, also sometimes called \u201cterminological logics\u201d or \u201cKL-ONE-type languages\u201d. Description logics are also subsets of predicate calculus, but are expressed using a different syntax, allowing a different set of syntactic restrictions to be explored. We first define a simple description logic, summarize some results on its expressive power, and then analyze its learnability. It is shown that the full logic cannot be tractably learned. However, syntactic restrictions exist that enable tractable learning from positive examples alone, independent of the size of the vocabulary used to describe examples. The learnable sublanguage appears to be incomparable in expressive power to any subset of first-order logic previously known to be learnable.", "authors": ["William W.

Since it is surely an important factor in the cost of maintaining a program over its lifetime, the usefulness of an accurate and inexpensive measure of readability is obvious.

{"abstract": "Conveyance and recognition of human emotion and affective expression is influenced by many factors, including culture. Within the user modeling field, it has become increasingly necessary to understand the role affect can play in personalizing interactive interfaces using embodied animated agents. However, little research within the computer science field aims at understanding cultural differences within this vein. Therefore, we conducted a study to evaluate if differences exist in the way various cultures perceive emotion from body posture. We used static posture images of affectively expressive avatars to conduct recognition experiments with subjects from three cultures. After analyzing the subjects' judgments using multivariate analysis, we grounded the identified differences into a set of low-level posture features. We then used Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA) and an unsupervised expectation maximization (EM) model to build separate cultural models for affective posture recognition. Our results could prove useful to aide designers in creating more effective affective avatars.", "authors": ["Andrea Kleinsmith", "P.

{"abstract": "Interval methods for verified integration of initial value problems (IVPs) for ODEs have been used for more than 40 years. For many classes of IVPs, these methods are able to compute guaranteed error bounds for the flow of an ODE, where traditional methods provide only approximations to a solution. Overestimation, however, is a potential drawback of verified methods. For some problems, the computed error bounds become overly pessimistic, or the integration even breaks down. The dependency problem and the wrapping effect are particular sources of overestimations in interval computations. Berz and his coworkers have developed Taylor model methods, which extend interval arithmetic with symbolic computations. The latter is an effective tool for reducing both the dependency problem and the wrapping effect. By construction, Taylor model methods appear particularly suitable for integrating nonlinear ODEs. We analyze Taylor model based integration of ODEs and compare Taylor model methods with traditional enclosure methods for IVPs for ODEs.", "authors": ["Markus Neher", "Kenneth R.

{"abstract": "Personal communications and mobile computing will require a wireless network infrastructure which is fast deployable, possibly multihop, and capable of multimedia service support. The first infrastructure of this type was the Packet Radio Network (PRNET), developed in the 70's to address the battlefield and disaster recovery communication requirements. PRNET was totally asynchronous and was based on a completely distributed architecture. It handled datagram traffic reasonably well, but did not offer efficient multimedia support. Recently, under the WAMIS (Wireless Adaptive Mobile Information Systems) and Glomo ARPA programs several mobile, multimedia, multihop (M3) wireless network architectures have been developed, which assume some form of synchronous, time division infrastructure. The synchronous time frame leads to efficient multimedia support implementations. However, it introduces more complexity and is less robust in the face of mobility and channel fading. In this paper, we examine the impact of synchronization on wireless M3 network performance. First, we introduce MACA/PR, an asynchronous network based on the collision avoidance MAC scheme employed in the IEEE 802.11 standard. Then, we evaluate and compare several wireless packet networks ranging from the totally asynchronous PRNET to the synchronized cluster TDMA network. We examine the tradeoffs between time synchronization and performance in various traffic and mobility environments.", "authors": ["Chunhung Richard Lin", "Mario Gerla"], "n_citation": 110, "references": ["0b93552e-74e8-483f-82cb-5c04e1cd9232", "12141ab1-c2ff-4910-8c9d-19c5fbef7d59", "185dfc84-5463-4022-b36f-7e95073d5042", "1f3cd492-e408-46b0-93bb-9e8789265211", "5bec2d86-69f8-438d-812e-b4e040b0841b", "5e253596-b56f-4d7d-b1a8-963ef90d46fc", "60fb0dc2-bde3-4714-948e-de0ed12ab460", "83a2eb55-b330-4e0c-8dc9-05e9466d5028", "aed8a9ce-8600-414f-a7a5-9bd5962a8253", "e2baa34c-eba8-45fc-ac64-693761c9680b", "ef4e6127-1de5-4998-a80c-571c606860a9"], "title": "Real-time support in multihop wireless networks", "venue": "Wireless Networks", "year": 1999, "id": "73aa328e-83a1-4ccd-a60a-02d07df09db2"}

{"abstract": "The task of decentralized decision-making involves interaction of a set of local decision-makers, each of which operates under limited sensing capabilities and is thus subjected to ambiguity during the process of decision-making. In our prior work, we made a key observation that such ambiguities are of differing gradations and presented a framework for inferencing over varying ambiguity levels to arrive at local and global control decisions. We develop a similar framework for performing diagnosis in a decentralized setting. For each event-trace executed by a system being monitored, each local diagnoser issues its own diagnosis decision (failure or nonfailure or unsure), tagged with a certain ambiguity level (zero being the minimum). A global diagnosis decision is taken to be a ldquowinningrdquo local diagnosis decision, i.e., one with a minimum ambiguity level. The computation of an ambiguity level for a local decision requires an assessment of the self-ambiguity as well as the ambiguities of the others, and an inference based up on such knowledge. In order to characterize the class of systems for which any fault can be detected within a uniformly bounded number of steps (or ldquodelayrdquo), we introduce the notion of  N  -inference-diagnosability for Failures (also called  N -inference F-diagnosability), where the index  N  represents the maximum ambiguity level of any winning local decision. We show that the codiagnosability introduced in is the same as 0-inference F-diagnosability; the conditional F-codiagnosability introduced in , is a type of 1-inference F-diagnosability; the class of higher-index inference F-diagnosable systems strictly subsumes the class of lower-index ones; and the class of inference F-diagnosable systems is strictly subsumed by the class of systems that are centrally F-diagnosable.", "authors": ["Ratnesh Kumar", "Shigemasa Takai"], "n_citation": 63, "references": ["07b09c3f-a169-47e6-9f6f-20109653915f", "0cb4347d-6747-4389-9737-1ae8624eb85b", "11b78cfd-4b23-47c9-9065-2f2443d2f261", "11f317fb-0c66-4bf9-b190-b1782232ac4f", "15444a0c-9dce-4cf5-9efa-bdc13f9dcd8f", "2065ae6a-4dde-48a9-aaf0-651ccc72d578", "494f70b9-b174-49dc-9f61-f5c30a0fbf3d", "5576b3c0-5fab-484d-90a5-04b8557b94e0", "5bce6733-5c17-447b-867f-b7af1f7f3924", "843d1adf-0e6f-4e86-a3f5-d665ebb31bfa", "9003d651-6f7f-4297-a3da-2777385246fc", "9dcdf903-1569-462a-8e1b-4e0daaf771c4", "a63012b9-bbb6-4f7d-9d40-c59b703af1f6", "ae27de78-f4f4-4287-aa15-a4e8dca03a3c", "b51c011b-2702-49a0-af4c-ea8ce3b097de", "c20cc444-80d7-4ec0-b67c-d4046a62a77e", "c6467774-da36-4524-9ed8-dc9088923a39", "ca144b16-3c2d-4e0b-b9bd-f957c681c92c", "ff598b32-5d27-4ea1-b989-49d89870c18a"], "title": "Inference-Based Ambiguity Management in Decentralized Decision-Making: Decentralized Diagnosis of Discrete-Event Systems", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering", "year": 2009, "id": "fa5fd76b-c947-4256-bdcc-f13872b1f2da"}

Structural descriptions of chemicals in terms of atoms and bonds are derived from the chemicals' SMILES encodings. Definition of substructures are used as background knowledge. Predicting biodegradability is essentially a regression problem, but we also consider a discretized version of the target variable.

{"abstract": "Intelligent information retrieval (IIR) requires inference. The number of inferences that can be drawn by even a simple reasoner is very large, and the inferential resources available to any practical computer system are limited. This problem is one long faced by AI researchers. In this paper, we present a method used by two recent machine learning programs for control of inference that is relevant to the design of IIR systems. The key feature of the approach is the use of explicit representations of desired knowledge, which we call  knowledge goals.  Our theory addresses the representation of knowledge goals, methods for generating and transforming these goals, and heuristics for selecting among potential inferences in order to feasibly satisfy such goals. In this view, IIR becomes a kind of planning: decisions about what to infer, how to infer and when to infer are based on representations of desired knowledge, as well as internal representations of the system's inferential abilities and current state. The theory is illustrated using two case studies, a natural language understanding program that learns by reading novel newspaper stories, and a differential diagnosis program that improves its accuracy with experience. We conclude by making several suggestions on how this machine learning framework can be integrated with existing information retrieval methods.", "authors": ["Ashwin Ram", "Lawrence Hunter"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["042096cb-b6a2-4feb-b781-b06d3d5fe726", "339c8ac1-28df-428e-b965-61f2540a2072"], "title": "A Goal-Based Approach to Intelligent Information Retrieval.", "venue": "international conference on machine learning", "year": 1991, "id": "f412d277-f54e-4139-8d86-0865cc0a0e01"}

{"abstract": "Phase-locked loop (PLL) algorithms are commonly used to track sinusoidal components in currents and voltage signals in three-phase power systems. Despite the simplicity of those algorithms, problems arise when signals have variable frequency or amplitude, or are polluted with harmonic content and measurement noise, as can be found in aircraft ac power systems where the fundamental frequency can vary in the range 360-900 Hz. To improve the quality of phase and frequency estimates in such power systems, a novel PLL scheme based on a real-time implementation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is presented in this paper. The DFT algorithm calculates the amplitudes of three consecutive components in the frequency domain. These components are used to determine an error signal which is minimized by a proportional-integral loop filter in order to estimate the fundamental frequency. The integral of the estimated frequency is the estimated phase of the fundamental component, and this is fed back to the DFT algorithm.

{"abstract": "The objective of this paper is to present a number of features that can be extracted from handwritten digits and used for author verification or identification of a person's handwriting. The features under consideration are mainly computational features some of which cannot be easily evaluated by humans. On the other hand, these features can be extracted by computer algorithms with a high degree of accuracy. The eleven features used are described. All features were appropriately binarized so that binary feature vectors of constant lengths could be formed. These vectors were then used for author discrimination, using the Hamming distance measure. For this task a writer database consisting of 15 writers was created. Each writer was asked to write random strings of 0 to 9 at least 10 times. The results indicate that the combined features work well at discriminating writers and warrant further detailed investigation. Although the set of features was designed for dealing with handwritten digits (as may be written on cheques), it may also be used for isolated alphabetic characters.", "authors": ["Graham Leedham", "Sumit Chachra"], "n_citation": 78, "references": ["4b56324c-0c5c-4141-86ef-6a0cbee35931", "4fa95ad7-531a-4695-b312-d76cd83d757a", "6a04e793-0522-4a4f-94ba-7fd62bcd9b21", "ab1364b3-211f-43a0-a156-8c9adc392b03"], "title": "Writer identification using innovative binarised features of handwritten numerals", "venue": "international conference on document analysis and recognition", "year": 2003, "id": "17f18329-e990-4fd9-9561-67f6f7d811d6"}

{"abstract": "Abstract   Many writers have argued that dialogue should be regarded as a joint activity (see for example (Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs, 1986; Grosz and Sidner, 1990; Schegloff, 1981; Suchman, 1987)), something that agents do  together , rather than simply as a product of the interaction of plan generators and recognizers working in synchrony and harmony, as plan-based theories propose. Such plan-based approaches do not explain why addresses ask clarification questions, why they confirm, or even, why they do not walk away. Rather, the joint action model claims that  both  parties to a dialogue are responsible for sustaining it. Participating in a dialogue requires the conversants to have at least a joint commitment to understand one another. The key questions to be answered include how to formalize such general commitments precisely, and to show how they predict the fine-grained synchrony so apparent in ordinary conversation. To begin to answer these questions, we sketch here how a formal theory of joint action explains confirmations that arise in task-oriented telephone dialogues. A more formal account is given in (Cohen and Levesque, 1991a). Then we argue that extensions of this analysis to dialogue more generally will be difficult. In particular, it will force us to give up our simplistic analyses of propositional content and literal meaning.", "authors": ["Philip R. Cohen", "H.

{"abstract": "This note is concerned with the event-triggered L 2  control for a sampled-data control system. A novel event-triggered transmission scheme is first proposed to determine whether or not the sampled-data should be transmitted. Under this scheme, the sampled-data transmission should be executed only when a threshold is violated, which means that less sampled-data is transmitted. This scheme does not require any special hardware for continuous measurement. Then, the sampled-data control system is modeled as a sampled-data error dependent system. A stability criterion is derived by constructing a novel Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional which fully utilizes the sawtooth structure characteristic of an artificial delay. Based on this stability criterion, a sufficient condition on the existence of a state feedback controller is given. A co-design algorithm is provided to obtain the parameters of the event-triggered transmission scheme and the controller gain simultaneously. Finally, an inverted pendulum example is given to show the effectiveness of the event-triggered transmission scheme and the co-design algorithm.", "authors": ["Chen Peng", "Qing-Long Han"], "n_citation": 157, "references": ["001b21ea-8483-4549-b1eb-779581341aba", "18c7c422-75bb-4181-ab26-dc16c519c41f", "36bb5e4d-dbbd-4b05-922e-83f79a2181b6", "3f0147f8-a55c-4ff7-9ef8-bf4b53b5b54d", "432c9e30-6faf-4bfa-b09b-ca8f25481efb", "461eb2fe-62b1-4ab1-b17e-1b4986a8f414", "854b25c0-64cf-4ba8-b188-661b608a7531", "9c6789c3-a632-41f2-a087-b3d65b12bd51", "a7da2734-ae77-4c56-bf2b-4ce92e2d20d0", "cb795d02-bb85-4f0d-a154-352f101dc299", "dc8cd8a6-4251-44db-bf5e-cb31487becb6"], "title": "A Novel Event-Triggered Transmission Scheme and ${\\cal L}_{2}$ Control Co-Design for Sampled-Data Control Systems", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control", "year": 2013, "id": "2cb3c939-deeb-408c-9ff5-d03bd567942d"}
{"abstract": "The problem of graph matching (GM) in general is nondeterministic polynomial-complete and many approximate pairwise matching techniques have been proposed. For a general setting in real applications, it typically requires to find the consistent matching across a batch of graphs. Sequentially performing pairwise matching is prone to error propagation along the pairwise matching sequence, and the sequences generated in different pairwise matching orders can lead to contradictory solutions. Motivated by devising a robust and consistent multiple-GM model, we propose a unified alternating optimization framework for multi-GM. In addition, we define and use two metrics related to graphwise and pairwise consistencies. The former is used to find an appropriate reference graph, which induces a set of basis variables and launches the iteration procedure. The latter defines the order in which the considered graphs in the iterations are manipulated. We show two embodiments under the proposed framework that can cope with the nonfactorized and factorized affinity matrix, respectively. Our multi-GM model has two major characters: 1) the affinity information across multiple graphs are explored in each iteration by fixing part of the matching variables via a consistency-driven mechanism and 2) the framework is flexible to incorporate various existing pairwise GM solvers in an out-of-box fashion, and also can proceed with the output of other multi-GM methods.

{"abstract": "In recent years, we have seen tremendous growth in the applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) operating in unlicensed spectrum bands. However, there is evidence that existing unlicensed spectrum is becoming overcrowded. On the other hand, with recent advances in cognitive radio (CR) technology, it is possible to apply the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) model in WSNs to get access to less congested spectrum, possibly with better propagation characteristics. In this paper we present a conceptual design of CR-based WSNs, identify the main advantages and challenges of using CR technology, and suggest possible remedies to overcome the challenges. As an illustration, we study the performance of CR-based WSN used for the automation and control applications in residential and commercial premises. Our simulation results compare the performance of a CR-based WSN with a standard ZigBee/802.15.4 WSN.", "authors": ["Dave Cavalcanti", "Sushanta Das", "Jianfeng Wang", "Kiran Challapali"], "n_citation": 104, "references": ["239e0847-5e35-4e0a-91ab-a4065613a3e6", "31cdcc22-1a04-4dea-8800-0e83b0c67dfa", "338363e4-3830-4f58-9230-7267da43de51", "76f06d45-bde4-4aad-b5a1-a64e4c6f308e", "f1e74152-3f7c-4c44-b628-cdf47a17587f"], "title": "Cognitive Radio Based Wireless Sensor Networks", "venue": "international conference on computer communications and networks", "year": 2008, "id": "6a247d2e-5a4f-49ea-815c-bca6e59232c7"}

{"abstract": "A new retransmission-based error control technique is presented that does not incur any additional latency in frame playout times, and hence are suitable for interactive applications. It takes advantage of the motion prediction loop employed in most motion compensation-based codecs. By correcting errors in a reference frame caused by earlier packet loss, it prevents error propagation. The technique rearranges the temporal dependency of frames so that a displayed frame is referenced for the decoding of its succeeding dependent frames much later than its display time. Thus, the delay in repairing lost packets can be effectively masked out. The developed technique is combined with layered video coding to maintain consistently good video quality even under heavy packet loss. Through the results of extensive Internet experiments, the paper shows that layered coding can be very effective when combined with the retransmission-based error control technique for low-bit rate transmission over best effort networks where no network-level mechanism exists for protecting high priority data from packet loss.", "authors": ["Injong Rhee"], "n_citation": 141, "references": ["44b4a4eb-2bf4-40b7-8f42-30ff0d889991", "48e0629a-7bed-40bc-b749-07ab26646d4f", "54f7f3ef-3fd8-4b9a-aaea-e291a297b2c2", "84005731-a535-491b-afea-e23f69e95881", "a9971648-429b-41b3-8ebc-e4c601098ff6", "b9c26d61-9f87-4970-a982-607d4549435f", "c047fdc5-463e-4806-8195-98426ad3d232", "eb620c43-080b-4601-8f4b-ee7f0ef049be"], "title": "Error control techniques for interactive low-bit rate video transmission over the Internet", "venue": "acm special interest group on data communication", "year": 1998, "id": "c7d8546c-4664-4d95-bb31-469ee7d87385"}
{"abstract": "Object-oriented, concurrent, and event-based programming models provide a natural framework in which to express the behavior of distributed and embedded software systems. However, contemporary programming languages still base their I/O primitives on a model in which the environment is assumed to be centrally controlled and synchronous, and interactions with the environment carried out through blocking subroutine calls. The gap between this view and the natural asynchrony of the real world has made event-based programming a complex and error-prone activity, despite recent focus on event-based frameworks and middleware. In thin paper we present a consistent model of event-based concurrency, centered around the notion of reactive objects.

{"abstract": "It has been well documented that there is a correlation between the structure of an architecture and the organization that produces it. More concretely there is a correlation between task interdependencies and coordination among the people or teams realizing these tasks. The amount of coordination needed among teams is related to the nature of these task interdependencies. As the scale and complexity of organization and systems grow it is not uncommon to have factors such as geographic boundaries, organization boundaries, cultural differences, and so forth impede the ability of certain individuals or teams to coordinate effectively. While there is some understanding of the factors that impede the ability of teams to coordinate, the factors that cause task interdependence in software systems is less well understood. The current view is that it is the interactions across module boundaries (assuming a module is assigned as a task or work item to a single team) that cause task interdependence; we have found that this view is not sufficient. In this paper we present three cases where additional architectural mechanisms created task interdependencies that the organizations were unable to accommodate.

The UK nuclear legacy comprises a number of facilities that are significantly contaminated by radioactivity and non-radiological toxins. Here, the use of remote and teleoperated robotic solutions provide an invaluable option for the safe retrieval and disposal of contaminated materials. Since the behaviour of hydraulically-driven manipulators is dominated by the nonlinear, lightly-damped dynamics of the actuators, existing systems can suffer from a relatively slow and imprecise control action.

This methodology is based on a combination of ideas from different existing methodologies (UML, OCTOPUS, etc.) together with the integration of rate-monotonic analysis in the context of the SDL formal description technique development cycle. Additionally, in order to get this integration, a real-time execution model for SDL is presented to allow us to express hard real-time constraints.

{"abstract": "Sampling arises simultaneously with input and output delays in networked control systems. When the delay is left uncompensated, the sampling period is generally required to be sufficiently small, the delay sufficiently short, and, for nonlinear systems, only semiglobal practical stability is generally achieved. For example, global stabilization of strict-feedforward systems under sampled measurements, sampled-data stabilization of the nonholonomic unicycle with arbitrarily sparse sampling, and sampled-data stabilization of LTI systems over networks with long delays, are open problems. In this paper, we present two general results that address these example problems as special cases. First, we present global asymptotic stabilizers for forward complete systems under arbitrarily long input and output delays, with arbitrarily long sampling periods, and with continuous application of the control input. Second, we consider systems with sampled measurements and with control applied through a zero-order hold, under the assumption that the system is stabilizable under sampled-data feedback for some sampling period, and then construct sampled-data feedback laws that achieve global asymptotic stabilization under arbitrarily long input and measurement delays.

{"abstract": "We present a Newton-based extremum seeking algorithm for the multivariable case. The design extends the recent Newton-based extremum seeking algorithms for the scalar case and introduces a dynamic estimator of the Hessian matrix that removes the difficulty with the possible singularity of this matrix estimate. This estimator has the form of a differential Riccati equation. We prove local stability of the new algorithm for general nonlinear dynamic systems using averaging and singular perturbations. In comparison with the standard gradient-based multivariable extremum seeking, the proposed algorithm removes the dependence of the convergence rate on the unknown Hessian matrix and makes the convergence rate, of both the parameter estimates and of the estimates of the Hessian inverse, user-assignable.

{"abstract": "Sequential pattern mining is an important data-mining method for determining time-related behavior in sequence databases. The information obtained from sequential pattern mining can be used in marketing, medical records, sales analysis, and so on. Existing methods only focus on the concept of frequency because of the assumption that sequences' behaviors do not change over time. The environment from which the data is generated is often dynamic, however, so the sequences' behaviors may change over time. To adapt the discovered patterns to these changes, two new concepts, recency and compactness, are incorporated into traditional sequential pattern mining. The concept of recency causes patterns to quickly adapt to the latest behaviors in sequence databases, while the concept of compactness ensures reasonable time spans for the discovered patterns. We named the new patterns CFR-patterns because three concepts (compactness, frequency, and recency) are simultaneously considered. An efficient method is presented to find CFR-patterns. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed methods are computationally efficient and that they are more advantageous than traditional methods when sequences' behaviors change over time.", "authors": ["Yen-Liang Chen", "Ya-Han Hu"], "n_citation": 53, "references": ["00bb2dbc-92c8-4e6a-819d-d2988bf177a3", "02c7c44b-60ae-4601-8ad2-08aa1d4f14c9", "14640a54-46a1-4ddd-9f68-0f40f9b71c8f", "18b8d605-1870-4b8e-838f-0026290932f0", "1c529110-0401-4185-b196-23dd38144537", "2663d978-9596-4c7c-bf06-14f80ecf46a3", "34f10697-a847-4751-b187-45477c33d210", "40b1014f-f0a2-4222-aabb-8d5e1c4431ce", "40cd5a67-ed46-4d65-83cc-8a00e2beea62", "4dbeb111-6d1e-48ae-b8de-7d8bc6d548d3", "4f452c65-ca79-43d0-9a00-8616e4924106", "549404e8-5b41-4b25-af4f-b7d0846a23b4", "59027752-f910-4030-b5c4-e84c31088221", "61f0e9b2-a9bd-49cc-b750-5c498feb94a9", "668495d0-628d-42d9-8b8e-66f5369c2cb8", "6c5e1d10-bd51-4ac6-83f8-b74efec751b2", "6d1a4b8a-1eaf-4e84-beba-d065028fe671", "6f90143f-16be-4bc9-a661-f126f73faec4", "718562ef-10d7-43a7-b958-cdcdca367151", "76e4a950-8897-46d0-9c93-f74732df63a7", "8944b492-28ff-404c-90bc-104f7874aa69", "91f98247-ab9a-459c-ac7c-309ee51f62bd", "93d26321-c26e-402c-99cd-5d423a200961", "96018174-7865-47e6-bfe0-c915c26d789e", "9ca0038f-4992-4f4a-a57d-e01a540c791c", "ad0ab9a2-bddd-4b5f-a6d4-9bb60409e1a4", "b406c0e2-f2a0-4c7e-aaca-dd8f0f63c1a2", "b7f1cb36-2173-4335-9328-c8264313fe0d", "bfaf96e8-a3d0-4bb1-8be4-0856220f6d46", "c9b05538-7ed2-48a2-b969-62f1adbb04b2", "d1c93534-82a5-41fa-a5fa-9d18f5c2577f", "e75a63dd-4be4-4291-b16f-6aa1948479c4", "f24c8918-bdad-4fa9-85a0-91509333d9dc", "fe858af6-c573-42b7-af5e-7a9a87f28211"], "title": "Constraint-based sequential pattern mining: the consideration of recency and compactness", "venue": "decision support systems", "year": 2006, "id": "89fa265d-36e9-48e2-8b96-602f951a2b78"}
{"abstract": "Self-organizing traffic jams are known to occur in medium-to-high density traffic flows, and it is suspected that adaptive cruise control (ACC) may affect their onset in mixed human-ACC traffic. Unfortunately, closed-form solutions that predict the occurrence of these jams in mixed human-ACC traffic do not exist. In this paper, both human and ACC driving behaviors are modeled using the General Motors fourth car-following model and are distinguished by using different model parameter values. A closed-form solution that explains the impact of ACC on congestion due to the formation of self-organized traffic jams (or \u201cphantom\u201d jams) is presented. The solution approach utilizes the master equation for modeling the self-organizing behavior of traffic flow at a mesoscopic scale and the General Motors fourth car-following model for describing the driver behavior at the microscopic scale. It is found that, although the introduction of ACC-enabled vehicles into the traffic stream may produce higher traffic flows, it also results in disproportionately higher susceptibility of the traffic flow to congestion.", "authors": ["Kshitij Jerath", "Sean N.

{"abstract": "This paper explores the possibility of using multispectral iris information to enhance the recognition performance of an iris biometric system. Commercial iris recognition systems typically sense the iridal reflection pertaining to the near-infrared (IR) range of the electromagnetic spectrum. This work examines the iris information represented in the visible and IR portion of the spectrum. It is hypothesized that, based on the color of the eye, different components of the iris are highlighted at multiple wavelengths. To this end, an acquisition procedure for obtaining co-registered multispectral iris images associated with the IR, Red, Green and Blue wavelengths of the electromagnetic spectrum, is first discussed. The components of the iris that are revealed in multiple spectral channels/wavelengths based on the color of the eye are studied. An adaptive histogram equalization scheme is invoked to enhance the iris structure. The performance of iris recognition across multiple wavelengths is next evaluated. Experiments indicate the potential of using multispectral information to enhance the performance of iris recognition systems.", "authors": ["Christopher K.

A variable transformation method is used to convert the consensus problem to a partial stability problem. Both first-order and second-order systems are investigated under fixed and switching topologies, respectively. It is assumed that the inherent nonlinear terms satisfy the Lipshitz condition. Sufficient conditions on the feedback gains are given based on a Lyapunov function method. For first-order systems under a fixed topology, the consensus is achieved if the feedback gain related to the agents\u2019 positions is large enough. For first-order systems under switching topologies, the effect of the minimum dwell time for the switching signal on the consensus achievement is considered. For second-order systems under a fixed topology, the consensus is achieved if the feedback gains related to the agents\u2019 positions and velocities, respectively, are both large enough. For second-order systems under switching topologies, a switching variable transformation is given. Then, the consensus problem is investigated when all the digraphs are strongly connected and weighted balanced with a common weighted vector.

{"abstract": "Agents are autonomous software components that work with one another in a decentralized fashion to achieve some end. Agent systems have been used in Technology Enhanced Learning (TEL) before, but these applications seldom take advantage of the fact that each agent may have its own goals and strategies, which makes agent systems an attractive way of providing personalized learning. In particular, since agents can solve problems in a decentralized way, this makes them an attractive way of supporting informal learning. In this paper we use scenarios to examine how common problem solving techniques from the agents world (voting, coalition formation and auction systems) map to significant challenges for personalized and informal learning in the TEL world. Through an agent simulation we then show how an agent system might perform in one of those scenarios and explore how different agent strategies might influence the outcome. Based on this work we argue that agent systems provide a way of providing ultra-personalization of the learning process in a decentralized way and highlight equitability and scrutability as two key challenges for future investigation.", "authors": ["Ali M.

{"abstract": "The solution of most nonlinear control problems hinges upon the solvability of partial differential equations or inequalities. In particular, disturbance attenuation and optimal control problems for nonlinear systems are generally solved exploiting the solution of the so-called Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) inequality and the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, respectively. An explicit closed-form solution of this inequality, or equation, may however be hard or impossible to find in practical situations. Herein we introduce a methodology to circumvent this issue for input-affine nonlinear systems proposing a dynamic, i.e., time-varying, approximate solution of the HJ inequality and of the HJB equation the construction of which does not require solving any partial differential equation or inequality. This is achieved considering the immersion of the underlying nonlinear system into an augmented system defined on an extended state-space in which a (locally) positive definite storage function, or value function, can be explicitly constructed.

{"abstract": "This study draws upon theories of task interdependence and organizational inertia to analyze the effect of quality improvement on infrastructure activity costs in software development. Although increasing evidence indicates that quality improvement reduces software development costs, the impact on infrastructure activities is not known. Infrastructure activities include services like computer operations, data integration, and configuration management that support software development. Because infrastructure costs represent a substantial portion of firms' information technology budgets, it is important to identify innovations that yield significant cost savings in infrastructure activities. We evaluate quality and cost data collected in nine infrastructure activity centers over 10 years of product development in a major software firm undergoing a quality transformation. Findings indicate that infrastructure activities do benefit from quality improvement. The greatest marginal cost savings are realized in infrastructure activities that are highly interdependent with development and that occur later in the software development life cycle. Organizational inertia influences the rapidity with which the infrastructure activities benefit from higher product quality, especially for the more specialized activities. Finally, our findings suggest that although the savings in infrastructure from quality improvement are substantial, there are diminishing returns to quality improvement in infrastructure activities.", "authors": ["Donald E.

{"abstract": "Many modern compilers implement function calls (or returns) in two steps: first, a  closure  environment is properly installed to provide access for free variables in the target program fragment; second, the control is transferred to the target by a \u201cjump with arguments (or results)\u201d.  Closure conversion , which decides where and how to represent closures at runtime, is a crucial step in compilation of functional languages. We have a new algorithm that exploits the use of compile-time control and data flow information to optimize closure representations. By extensive closure sharing and allocating as many closures in registers as possible, our new closure conversion algorithm reduces heap allocation by 36% and memory fetches for local/global variables by 43%; and improves the already-efficient code generated by the Standard ML of New Jersey compiler by about 17% on a DECstation 5000. Moreover, unlike most other approaches, our new closure allocation scheme satisfies the strong \u201csafe for space complexity\u201d rule, thus achieving good asymptotic space usage.", "authors": ["Zhong Shao", "Andrew W.

{"abstract": "As mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) become ever more popular, it also becomes more and more interesting to build distributed network applications (e.g. data storage, etc.) that have been successfully built using DHTs on the Internet in such MANETs. For this purpose, DHT substrates especially designed for the use in MANETs have been recently proposed. In this paper, we demonstrate that such a DHT substrate (MADPastry) can be efficiently used to not only provide indirect, key-based overlay routing, but also conventional direct unicasting. Our simulation results show that DHT-based unicasting can markedly outperform conventional reactive ad hoc routing (AODV) as well as proactive ad hoc routing (OLSR). Therefore, MANET nodes that are already running a DHT substrate for application purposes will no longer have to maintain a separate ad hoc routing protocol in parallel but can use their DHT substrate for conventional point-to-point ad hoc routing as well.", "authors": ["Thomas Zahn", "Jochen H.

{"abstract": "System energy models are important for energy optimization and management in mobile systems. However, existing system energy models are built in a lab setting with the help from a second computer. Not only are they labor-intensive; but also they do not adequately account for the great diversity in the hardware and usage of mobile systems. Moreover, existing system energy models are intended for energy estimation for time intervals of one second or longer; they do not provide the required rate for fine-grain use such as per-application energy accounting.   In this work, we study a self-modeling paradigm in which a mobile system automatically generates its energy model without any external assistance. Our solution, Sesame, leverages the possibility of self power measurement through the smart battery interface and employs a suite of novel techniques to achieve accuracy and rate much higher than that of the smart battery interface.   We report the implementation and evaluation of Sesame on a laptop and a smartphone. The experiment results show that Sesame is able to generate system energy models of 95% accuracy at one estimation per second and of 88% accuracy at one estimation per 10ms, without any external assistance.

{"abstract": "Software process simulation models hold out the promise of improving project planning and control. However, quantitative models require a very detailed understanding of the software process. In particular, process knowledge needs to be represented quantitatively which requires extensive, reliable software project data. When such data is lacking, quantitative models must impose severe constraints, restricting the value of the models. In contrast qualitative models are able to cope with imprecise knowledge by reasoning at a more abstract level. This paper illustrates the value and flexibility of qualitative models by developing a model of the software staffing process and comparing it with other quantitative staffing models. We show that the qualitative model provides more insights into the staffing process than the quantitative models because it requires fewer constraints and can thus simulate more behaviors. In particular, the qualitative model produces three possible outcomes: adding staff can increases project duration (i.e. Brooks' Law), adding staff may not affect duration, or adding staff may decrease duration.

{"abstract": "We propose a computationally coherent model of cerebellar motor learning based on the feedback-error-learning scheme. We assume that climbing fiber responses represent motor-command errors generated by some of the premotor networks such as the feedback controllers at the spinal-, brain stem- and cerebral levels. Thus, in our model, climbing fiber responses are considered to convey motor errors in the motor-command coordinates rather than in the sensory coordinates. Based on the long-term depression in Purkinje cells each corticonuclear microcomplex in different regions of the cerebellum learns to execute predictive and coordinative control of different types of movements. Ultimately, it acquires an inverse model of a specific controlled object and complements crude control by the premotor networks. This general model is developed in detail as a specific neural circuit model for the lateral hemisphere. A new experiment is suggested to elucidate the coordinate frame in which climbing fiber responses are represented.", "authors": ["Mitsuo Kawato", "Hiroaki Gomi"], "n_citation": 332, "references": ["4b6d934a-1796-428e-9a69-30d13c648eb3", "7d4ecdb4-6934-4ba6-b160-465a0b7ae81d", "e41f9127-e827-4831-93cb-671b5e759725"], "title": "A computational model of four regions of the cerebellum based on feedback-error learning", "venue": "Biological Cybernetics", "year": 1992, "id": "719c0b5c-767a-43b6-963c-0653786f7030"}

The PWA is an elegant, simple, and potentially very powerful domain-independent technique that has proven fruitful in other areas of AI [13, 5]. In the domain of reasoning about action, Ginsberg and Smith offer the PWA as a solution to the frame problem (What facts about the world remain true when an action is performed?) and its dual, the ramification problem [3] (What facts about the world must change when an action is performed?). In addition, Ginsberg and Smith offer the PWA as a solution to the qualification problem (When is it reasonable to assume that an action will succeed?), and claim for the PWA computational advantages over other approaches such as situation calculus.#R##N##R##N#Here and in [16] I show that the PWA fails to solve the frame, ramification, and qualification problems, even with additional simplifying restrictions not imposed by Ginsberg and Smith.

Several motivations why symmetric timetables might seem promising will be given. However, we provide examples showing that symmetry leads to suboptimality.

Classification results obtained using each individual method and in combination are presented. The results show that the oriented filter set results in finer discrimination providing complementary texture information to the DWF by making use of its orientation selectivity. As a result, a combination of the features from the output of two filter banks improved the classification accuracy significantly with a smaller number of features.", "authors": ["Sam-Deuk Kim", "Satish S.

{"abstract": "Ordered sets of documents are encountered more and more in information distribution systems, such as information retrieval systems. Classical similarity measures for ordinary sets of documents hence need to be extended to these ordered sets. This is done in this paper using fuzzy set techniques. First a general similarity measure is developed which contains the classical strong similarity measures such as Jaccard, Dice, Cosine and which contains the classical weak similarity measures such as Recall and Precision.Then these measures are extended to comparing fuzzy sets of documents. Measuring the similarity for ordered sets of documents is a special case of this, where, the higher the rank of a document, the lower its weight is in the fuzzy set. Concrete forms of these similarity measures are presented. All these measures are new and the ones for the weak similarity measures are the first of this kind (other strong similarity measures have been given in a previous paper by Egghe and Michel).Some of these measures are then tested in the IR-system Profil-Doc. The engine SPIRIT\u00a9 extracts ranked documents sets in three different contexts, each for 600 request.

{"abstract": "An efficient and geometrically intuitive algorithm for reliably interpreting the image velocities of moving objects in 3-D is presented. It is well known that under a weak perspective the image motion of points on a plane can be characterized by an affine transformation. It is shown that the relative image motion of a nearby non-coplanar point and its projection on the plane is equivalent to motion parallax, and because it is independent of view rotations it is a reliable geometric cue to 3-D shape and viewer/object motion. The authors summarize why structure from motion algorithms are often very sensitive to errors in the measured image velocities and then show how to efficiently and reliably extract an incomplete qualitative solution. They also show how to augment this into a complete solution if additional constraints or views are available. A real-time example is presented in which the 3-D visual interpretation of hand gestures or a hand-held object is used as part of a man-machine interface. This is an alternative to the Polhemus coil instrumented Dataglove commonly used in sensing manual gestures. >", "authors": ["Roberto Cipolla", "Yasukazu Okamoto", "Yoshinori Kuno"], "n_citation": 154, "references": ["0bd94505-8510-4866-8162-cdff0a4dd104", "1373ab54-0903-47cb-8e31-f86b23ccc98d", "905461e4-643b-4da0-a669-f52318b9e126", "a47302c8-134f-4098-8082-6595927e829e", "bcf3e7a6-dc04-4f23-906f-0824bd184d2f", "e2bbf174-7398-4c3d-a310-6a067bd948a9"], "title": "Robust structure from motion using motion parallax", "venue": "international conference on computer vision", "year": 1993, "id": "ffcbf413-fa62-4e51-a6a1-341cfd1a8654"}

I will discuss the approach of inoculating evolution by natural selection into the medium of the digital computer. This is not a physical/chemical medium; it is a logical/informational medium. Thus, these new instances of evolution are not subject to the same physical laws as organic evolution (e.g., the laws of thermodynamics) and exist in what amounts to another universe, governed by the \u201cphysical laws\u201d of the logic of the computer.

{"abstract": "Existing energy-efficient approaches to in-network aggregation in sensor networks can be classified into two categories, tree-based and multi-path-based, with each having unique strengths and weaknesses. In this paper, we introduce Tributary-Delta, a novel approach that combines the advantages of the tree and multi-path approaches by running them simultaneously in different regions of the network. We present schemes for adjusting the regions in response to changes in network conditions, and show how many useful aggregates can be readily computed within this new framework. We then show how a difficult aggregate for this context---finding frequent items---can be efficiently computed within the framework. To this end, we devise the first algorithm for frequent items (and for quantiles) that provably minimizes the worst case total communication for non-regular trees. In addition, we give a multi-path algorithm for frequent items that is considerably more accurate than previous approaches. These algorithms form the basis for our efficient Tributary-Delta frequent items algorithm. Through extensive simulation with real-world and synthetic data, we show the significant advantages of our techniques. For example, in computing Count under realistic loss rates, our techniques reduce answer error by up to a factor of 3 compared to  any  previous technique.", "authors": ["Amit Manjhi", "Suman Nath", "Phillip B.

{"abstract": "Brainstorming in small design groups typically involves one person taking notes and sketching at a whiteboard while other group members remain seated and contribute verbally. We believe that lowering the threshold for shared sketching improves idea generation from all members and supports building off the ideas of other members. We have designed and completed preliminary testing of a collaborative sketching system that enables simultaneous contribution to and viewing of a shared canvas through individual devices (Tablet PCs) and a digital whiteboard. A pilot study indicates that such a system helps equalize sketching contribution within a group although it reduces total sketching of the group as a whole. This finding suggests that individual access to a shared sketching space has implications for the brainstorming process such as a greater awareness of the quality and the relative amount of individual idea contribution.", "authors": ["Marcello Bast\u00e9a-Forte", "Corina Yen"], "n_citation": 24, "references": ["1b38111b-1ad6-46f5-80eb-d940315e6b8b", "33d80c16-b3dc-4cd3-9a8d-2375b0f61dba", "55cc1a34-3be0-474f-9f00-8c53a1e67918", "dfb23ae4-742a-497b-bff1-4353466b3665", "f7911798-787d-4f07-9cef-f652c99ec49e"], "title": "Encouraging contribution to shared sketches in brainstorming meetings", "venue": "human factors in computing systems", "year": 2007, "id": "38d141e9-386e-42b8-9799-5d57a2fdf847"}

The key concept is the use ofa code synthesizer in the kernel to generate specialized (thus short and fast) kernel routines for specifrc situations. We have three methods of synthesizing code: Factoring Invariants to bypass redundant computations; Collapsing Layers to eliminate unnecessary procedure calls and context switches; and Executable Data Structures to shorten data structure traversal time. Applying these methods, the kernel call synthesized to read /dev/mem takes about l5 microseconds on a 6g020 machine. A simple model of computation called a synthetic machine supports parallel and distributed processing. The interface to synthetic machine consists of six operations on four kinds of objects.

{"abstract": "When model checking a software component, a model of the environment in which that component is supposed to run is constructed. One of the major threats to the validity of this kind of analysis is the correctness of the environment model. In this paper, we identify and formalize a problem related to environment models --environment guarantees. It captures those cases where the correctness of the component under analysis is due solely to the model of its environment. Environment guarantees provides a model-based analog to a property-based notion of vacuity by identifying cases when the component is irrelevant to satisfaction of a property. The paper also presents a model checking technique for the detection of environment guarantees.

{"abstract": "We are interested in verifying dynamic properties of finite state reactive systems under fairness assumptions by model checking. The systems we want to verify are specified through a top-down refinement process.In order to deal with the state explosion problem, we have proposed in previous works to partition the reachability graph and to perform the verification on each part separately. Moreover, we have defined a class, called B  mod  , of dynamic properties that are  verifiable by parts , whatever the partition. We decide if a property  P  belongs to B  mod   by looking at the form of the Buchi automaton that accepts \u00ac P . However, when a property  P  belongs to B  mod  , the property  f  \u21d2  P , where  f  is a fairness assumption, does not necessarily belong to B  mod  .In this paper, we propose to use the refinement process in order to build the parts on which the verification has to be performed. We then show that with such a partition, if a property  P  is verifiable by parts and if  f  is the expression of the fairness assumptions on a system, then the property  f  \u21d2  P  is still verifiable by parts.This approach is illustrated by its application to the chip card protocol T e 1 using the  B  engineering design language.", "authors": ["Samir Chouali", "Jacques Julliand", "Pierre-Alain Masson", "Fran\u00e7oise Bellegarde"], "n_citation": 4, "references": ["036c1775-3f28-40b5-b67c-947debc8ff7a", "0d8e20fb-b8c8-4cee-b7fc-e601827e21bd", "1b55e057-9690-4090-a097-1b1bc301cc8b", "1dc59882-baf4-454c-a665-6fc985b821d4", "25225c97-7811-418b-8773-79312eb3cfc7", "34dc0d16-e150-4178-a576-b06e82c075f1", "405db597-8662-4965-a995-fb05e43f3c14", "4814eca2-167a-48bd-a7e6-60150e7a54e3", "48bbae50-96c3-4870-9c3c-3ca275baaac0", "5a11bdba-a1e0-4fa3-b721-28881da79107", "6ac7c9fc-caf1-438b-8748-a80299185ae8", "6e1b3f3c-5e75-44bd-bfb9-641dc0ea3ceb", "77d2ea65-9174-464d-a871-60b33377035c", "881becf1-7a91-494b-aaab-190f53815090", "8bc1f31b-8589-4fe9-b3b2-0b3da2da7640", "8c5ea3c0-f67c-47a5-b157-d78b5e2ce204", "9a4984f9-27d4-47eb-8bc8-0469bf540f94", "a0e01511-9865-4416-b87f-0a4dc5fb10bc", "ae7900a8-63a1-442a-b4e7-aaf9f4be9673", "c00bbb49-6e29-4103-8883-55acd23c248b", "cc98b569-9c2d-4886-882e-0c1fe89041ee", "e1470f3d-df1b-4ac1-87ac-1e45b9064a2f", "e2f00686-d81e-4d69-b5e3-88a9d8d2e7f9", "f48ecfa1-0426-4fd5-b952-b7aae794bf10", "f5f1b6cd-64e7-428f-bd7a-90c92ed50bde", "fcc366e1-ddca-43df-ae8e-0b068926dc2f", "fe336d42-3e80-4202-8635-a44a004b0192"], "title": "PLTL-partitioned model checking for reactive systems under fairness assumptions", "venue": "ACM Transactions in Embedded Computing Systems", "year": 2005, "id": "789c0f7d-eca2-4529-994b-96b1f4413d45"}

We propose a two-stage write-behind buffering scheme for handing checkpoint operations. The first-stage of buffering accumulates write data for better network utilization and the second-stage of buffering enables the alignment for the write requests to the file stripe boundaries. Aligned I/O requests avoid file lock contention that can seriously degrade I/O performance. We present our performance evaluation using BTIO benchmarks on both GPFS and Lustre file systems. With the two-stage buffering, the performance of BTIO through MPI independent I/O is significantly improved and even surpasses that of collective I/O.", "authors": ["Wei-keng Liao", "Avery Ching", "Kenin Coloma", "Alok N.

{"abstract": "The uncertainty principle is recognized as one of the fundamental results in signal processing. Its role in inference is, however, less well known outside of quantum mechanics. It is the aim of this paper to provide a unified approach to the problem of uncertainty in image processing. It is shown that uncertainty can be derived from the fundamental constraints on the process of vision-the requirements for class-defining operations which are both shift-invariant and insensitive to changes in illumination. It is thus shown that uncertainty plays a key role in the language of vision, since it affects the choice of both the alphabet, the elementary signals, and the syntax, the inferential structure, of vision. The report is concluded with a number of practical illustrations of these ideas, taken from such image processing tasks as enhancement, data compression, and segmentation.", "authors": ["Roland Wilson", "Goesta H.

{"abstract": "H.264/AVC video encoders have been widely used for its high coding efficiency. Since the computational demand proportional to the frame resolution is constantly increasing, it has been of great interest to accelerate H.264/AVC by parallel processing. Recently, graphics processing units (GPUs) have emerged as a viable target for accelerating general purpose applications by exploiting fine-grain data parallelisms. Despite extensive research effort to use GPUs to accelerate the H.264/AVC algorithm, it has not been successful to achieve any speed-up over the x264 algorithm that is known as the fastest CPU implementation because of significant communication overhead between the host CPU and the GPU and intra-frame dependency in the algorithm. In this paper, we propose a novel motion estimation (ME) algorithm tailored for NVIDIA GPU implementation. It is accompanied by a novel pipelining technique, called sub-frame ME processing, to effectively hide the communication overhead between the host CPU and the GPU. The proposed H.264 encoder achieves more than 20% speed-up compared with x264.", "authors": ["Youngsub Ko", "Youngmin Yi", "Soonhoi Ha"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["21b87d37-e64d-4930-a7d4-7819c3b9576c", "3fdd57ec-0a79-419f-bab6-1f490fce2754", "83f818e1-1516-4766-af2b-5f9dc618ed5b", "a5be4beb-3b78-463e-be1f-917a4369dac4", "c68fffc4-0c2d-40a4-9845-73e293c65545", "f82bb04a-7516-4382-9d48-26c34f307365"], "title": "An efficient parallel motion estimation algorithm and X264 parallelization in CUDA", "venue": "", "year": 2011, "id": "2887c448-c54c-4ff7-9cba-ae72586f2b62"}
{"abstract": "Use case models are used in object-oriented analysis for capturing and describing the functional requirements of a system. Use case models are also used in communication between stakeholders in development projects. It is therefore important that the use case models are constructed in such a way that they support the development process and promote a good understanding of the requirements among the stakeholders. Despite this, there are few guidelines on how to construct use case models.This paper describes an explorative study where three different sets of guidelines were used for constructing and documenting use case models. An experiment with 139 undergraduate students divided into 31 groups was conducted. Each group used one out of the three sets of guidelines when constructing a use case model from an informal requirements specification. After completing the use case model, each student answered a questionnaire.The results of the experiment indicate that guidelines based on templates support the construction of use case models that are easier to understand for the readers, than guidelines without specific details on how to document each use case. The guidelines based on templates were also considered as the most useful when constructing use cases. In addition to better understandability, our experiment indicates that the guidelines based on templates result in better use case models regarding also other quality attributes. Our results further indicate that it may be beneficial to combine the template guidelines with another set of guidelines that focus on the documentation of the flow of events of each use case.", "authors": ["Bente Anda", "Dag I.

{"abstract": "Active control strategy is an innovative method for enhancing structural functionality against strong ground motions. In this paper the performance of piezoelectric actuators for active control of the seismic responses of tall buildings is investigated. Three-dimensional modeling of the building is considered where three degrees of freedom including displacements in two perpendicular horizontal directions and rotation about the vertical axis are corresponded to each floor. The piezoelectric actuators are hosted at the bottom of the columns and the controlling forces produced by actuators are considered in the equations of motion of the buildings. Linear quadratic regulator (LQR), supervisory fuzzy controller (SFC) and fuzzy logic controller (FLC) are applied in the control designs. For the numerical studies, a real 10 story building subjected to an ensemble of 20 worldwide acceleration records is considered. Since there are many possible positions for placement of piezoelectric actuators in the test building, genetic algorithm is used for finding the optimal arrangement of actuators in order to achieve maximum reduction in building responses. The comparison of the controlled and uncontrolled responses of the test building indicates that the piezoelectric actuators are able to provide considerable reductions in buildings' seismic responses. Also the performance of the above three controllers reveals that the fuzzy controller is much more effective than the two others.", "authors": ["N. Fallah", "M.

{"abstract": "The formation of opinions in a large population is governed by endogenous (interactions with peers) and exogenous (influence of media) factors. In the analysis of opinion evolution in a large population, decision making rules are often approximated with non-Bayesian \u201crule of thumb\u201d methods. Adopting a non-Bayesian averaging rule, this paper focuses on an Eulerian bounded-confidence model of opinion dynamics and studies the information assimilation process resulting from exogenous inputs. In this model, a population is distributed over an opinion set, and each individual updates its opinion via (i) opinions of the population inside the individual's confidence range and (ii) the information from an exogenous input in that range. First, we establish various mathematical properties of this system's dynamics with time-varying inputs. Second, for the case of no exogenous input, we prove the convergence of the population's distribution to a sum of Dirac delta distributions.

{"abstract": "Parameter Sweep Experiments (PSEs) allow scientists and engineers to conduct experiments by running the same program code against different input data. This usually results in many jobs with high computational requirements. Thus, distributed environments, particularly Clouds, can be employed to fulfill these demands. However, job scheduling is challenging as it is an NP-complete problem. Recently, Cloud schedulers based on bio-inspired techniques - which work well in approximating problems with little input information - have been proposed. Unfortunately, existing proposals ignore job priorities, which is a very important aspect in PSEs since it allows accelerating PSE results processing and visualization in scientific Clouds. We present a new Cloud scheduler based on Ant Colony Optimization, the most popular bio-inspired technique, which also exploits well-known notions from operating systems theory.

{"abstract": "In an automated market for electronic goods new problems arise that have not been well studied previously. For example, information goods are very flexible. Marginal costs are negligible and nearly limitless bundling and unbundling of these items are possible, in contrast to physical goods. Consequently, producers can offer complex pricing schemes. However, the profit-maximizing design of a complex pricing schedule depends on a producer's knowledge of the distribution of consumer preferences for the available information goods. Preferences are private and can only be gradually uncovered through market experience. In this paper we compare dynamic performance across price schedules of varying complexity. We provide the producer with two machine learning methods producer that is performing a naive, knowledge-free form of leanings (function approximation and hill-climbing) which implement a strategy that balances exploitation to maximize current profits against exploration of the profit landscape to improve future profits. We find that the tradeoff between exploitation and exploration is different depending on the learning algorithms employed, and in particular depending on the complexity of the price schedule that if offered. In general, simpler price schedules are more robust and give up less profit during the learning periods even though in our stationary environment learning eventually is complete and the more complex schedules have high long-run profits. These results hold for both learning methods, even though the relative performance of the methods is quite sensitive to choice of initial conditions and differences in the smoothness of the profit landscape for different price schedules. Our results have implications for automated learning and strategic pricing in non-stationary environments, which arise when the consumer population changes, individuals change their preferences, or competing firms change their strategies.", "authors": ["Christopher H.

In this paper, an efficiently DCT based watermarking technique is proposed.

The proposed method can directly extract the embedded watermark from the watermarked image without using the original image, so it is feasible to implement it in a real time system. A scheme for spreading the watermarking information is also used to provide the robustness of the digital watermark.

In common real environments multiple light sources impinge on the skin. Therefore, for robust skin pixel detection, a dynamic skin colour model that can cope with the changes must be employed. We show that skin detection in video can be enhanced by exploiting the knowledge of the range of possible skin colours for the camera used. In normalized colour coordinates this range has a distinct shape we call the skin locus. We developed an adaptive histogram backprojection technique where the skin colour model is updated by pixels in the search region which fall in the skin locus. We demonstrate increased detection capability with webcam videos of faces taken successively under daylight, incandescent lamp, fluorescent light and a combination of these light sources.", "authors": ["Maricor Soriano", "Birgitta Martinkauppi", "Sami Huovinen", "Mika Laaksonen"], "n_citation": 181, "references": ["170ecfb7-51e8-4653-8266-233e222b2d06", "624decaa-2913-47a9-8502-2851d670730a", "86b92e76-2e9b-4b45-9343-764916d5f36a", "93378e13-0f38-429d-964b-abf990d6a37d", "b7fdfb26-0f3b-49c4-9d49-538c58d8620a", "cbef3141-e246-4b10-b59b-113bd4ed12b0"], "title": "Skin detection in video under changing illumination conditions", "venue": "international conference on pattern recognition", "year": 2000, "id": "46046365-e4fb-47bb-bf14-ecf5898e38c2"}

In this context, high dimensionality does not allow precision in the density estimation. We propose a local independent component analysis (ICA) representation of the data. The components can be assumed statistically independent and, in many cases, sparsity is observed. We show how these two characteristics can be used to simplify and add accuracy to the density estimation and develop bayesian decision within this representation. A first experiment illustrates that classification using an ICA representation is a technique that, even in low dimensions, performs comparably to standard classification techniques. The second experiment tests the ICA classification model on high dimensional data. Recognition was performed using local color histograms as salient features.

While most of the approaches employ controllability measures to achieve this goal, our developments can be classified as a simultaneous process and control design methodology. Based on novel  mixed integer dynamic optimization algorithms , our strategy features high fidelity process dynamic models, conventional PI control schemes, explicit consideration of structural process and control design aspects (such as number of trays, pairing of manipulated and controlled variables) through the introduction of 0\u20131 variables, and explicit consideration of time-varying disturbances and time-invariant uncertainties. The application of this strategy to a typical distillation system is discussed. In the second part of this chapter we present an extension of the process and control design framework that incorporates advanced model-based predictive controllers.  Parametric programming  is used for the controller derivation giving rise to a closed-form controller structure and removing the need for solving an optimization problem on-line. The resulting parametric controller is readily incorporated in the design optimization framework bringing about significant economic and operability benefits.

{"abstract": "Formalisms for visual language specification have been investigated for more than two decades. However, there has been little attempt to develop a systematic and comprehensive hierarchy of visual languages based on formal properties. Given the importance of the Chomsky hierarchy in the theory of textual languages and the difficulty of comparing the different visual language formalisms, it is clear that there is a need for such a hierarchy. We develop a hierarchy for VLs and investigate the expressiveness and the cost of parsing for classes defined therein. Although the hierarchy is based on the constraint multiset grammar formalism, we sketch how other visual language specification formalisms can be mapped into constraint multiset grammars. One consequence of our work is that a large class of \"naturally occurring\" visual languages are inherently context-sensitive, so that the core of such a hierarchy has to be built around different forms of context-sensitivity.", "authors": ["Kim Marriott", "Bernd Meyer"], "n_citation": 22, "references": ["2324c5f6-8d66-4f0c-a624-507a1c705803", "3573ee48-4571-4a6e-9715-a1b2f0eaffe0", "461cfe7f-5f9d-42f3-aecd-ab7b41e3bee6", "478d61db-de9d-4f0e-81df-9a72714bd911", "6f71fd32-2264-4317-80bc-62193961b7c9", "78b75f73-29df-4d35-8f2c-dad498aaca14", "99895f76-ad4a-4d68-b537-e8e30cda1ae2", "a76f45dd-899d-459b-9196-9d0fd5a8bb02", "b1fae319-06f0-4712-8646-03ec2b87d5c4", "b87af786-c9fa-43d2-a086-b78ba8f04636", "c500dca1-ec1e-45db-a81c-773fc3218648", "cdf015b3-be36-48cb-97e5-0969d15c82ed", "e44c5d6e-d017-4413-a8df-f4b3c1bcd47a", "ff96d2b5-c1aa-47ef-ba71-bf48b0634c01"], "title": "Towards a hierarchy of visual languages", "venue": "", "year": 1996, "id": "41a9adb7-adc3-4583-8d06-4395eb8fa89b"}
{"abstract": "A procedure for automated 2D shape model design is presented. The system is given a set of training example shapes defined by contour point coordinates. The shapes are automatically aligned using Procrustes analysis and clustered to obtain cluster prototypes (typical objects) and statistical information about intracluster shape variation. One difference from previous methods is that the training set is first automatically clustered and shapes considered to be outliers are discarded. In this way, cluster prototypes are not distorted by outliers. A second difference is in the manner in which registered sets of points are extracted from each shape contour. We propose a flexible point matching technique that takes into account both pose/scale differences and nonlinear shape differences. The matching method is independent of the objects' initial relative position/scale and does not require any manually tuned parameters. Our shape model design method was used to learn 11 different shapes from contours that were manually traced in MR brain images. The resulting model was then employed to segment several MR brain images that were not included in the shape-training set. A quantitative analysis of our shape registration approach, within the main cluster of each structure, demonstrated results that compare very well to those achieved by manual registration; achieving an average registration error of about 1 pixel. Our approach can serve as a fully automated substitute to the tedious and time-consuming manual 2D shape registration and analysis.", "authors": ["Nicolae Duta", "Anil K.

We emphasize how the choice of spread bandwidth affects the bit error rate of the system, as well as how it affects the reliability of various subsystems, such as those that perform coarse acquisition and adaptive power control. We then discuss how some of the waveforms being considered for cellular WCDMA systems differ from those in use in the narrowband CDMA cellular system, and emphasize, as an example, multicarrier CDMA.

As an example, we approach the orientation denoising problem via the geometric Beltrami framework for image processing. The feature (orientation) field is represented accordingly as the embedding of a two dimensional surface in the spatial-feature manifold. The resulted Beltrami flow is a selective smoothing process that respects the feature constraint. Orientation diffusion is treated as a canonical example where the feature (orientation in this case) space is the unit circle S1.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we study the statistical properties of the connectivity of vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) with user mobility. It is assumed that the nodes travel along a multilane highway that allows vehicles to pass each other. The nodes arrive at the highway through one of the traffic entry points according to a Poisson process and then travel in the same direction according to a user mobility model until they reach their exit points. The nodes on the highway may be able to communicate with each other. We derive the probability distribution of the node population size on the highway and the node's location distribution. Then, we determine the mean cluster size and the probability that the nodes will form a single cluster. The analysis of this paper also applies to any path in a network of highways, as well as to two-way traffic. The numerical results show the significance of mobility on the connectivity of VANETs.

{"abstract": "In an effort to reveal the fine-grained relationships between IT use, patterns of information flows, and individual information-worker productivity, we study task level practices at a midsize executive recruiting firm. We analyze both project-level and individual-level performance using: (1) detailed accounting data on revenues, compensation, project completion rates, and team membership for over 1300 projects spanning 5 years, (2) direct observation of over 125,000 email messages over a period of 10 months by individual workers, and (3) data on a matched set of the same workers' self-reported IT skills, IT use and information sharing. These detailed data permit us to econometrically evaluate a multistage model of production and interaction activities at the firm, and to analyze the relationships among key technologies, work practices, and output. We find that (a) IT use is positively correlated with non-linear drivers of productivity; (b) the structure and size of workers' communication networks are highly correlated with performance; (c) an inverted-U shaped relationship exists between multitasking and productivity such that, beyond an optimum, more multitasking is associated with declining project completion rates and revenue generation; and (d) asynchronous information seeking such as email and database use promotes multitasking while synchronous information seeking over the phone shows a negative correlation. Overall, these data show statistically significant relationships among technology use, social networks, completed projects, and revenues for project-based information workers. Results are consistent with simple models of queuing and multitasking and these methods can be replicated in other settings, suggesting new frontiers for IT value and social network research.", "authors": ["Sinan Aral", "Erik Brynjolfsson", "Marshall W.

Our system combines 2D appearance and 3D geometric constraints to efficiently extract scene summaries, build 3D models, and recognize instances of the landmark in new test images. We start by clustering images using low-dimensional global \"gist\" descriptors. Next, we perform geometric verification to retain only the clusters whose images share a common 3D structure. Each valid cluster is then represented by a single iconic view, and geometric relationships between iconic views are captured by an  iconic scene graph . In addition to serving as a compact scene summary, this graph is used to guide structure from motion to efficiently produce 3D models of the different aspects of the landmark. The set of iconic images is also used for recognition, i.e., determining whether new test images contain the landmark. Results on three data sets consisting of tens of thousands of images demonstrate the potential of the proposed approach.", "authors": ["Xiaowei Li", "Changchang Wu", "Christopher Zach", "Svetlana Lazebnik", "Jan Michael Frahm"], "n_citation": 302, "references": ["100bc74c-6dd0-4030-823c-e57e4b74f096", "5ba52f6f-7991-46c8-a6a9-0391a3b67083", "6c38b3b4-7562-493d-a40c-fe70abf039a7", "90c94d75-d0f1-407a-b03a-1c7e83330420", "9e9c90a7-2c9f-46aa-ba19-10db07b7a4bb", "ab3afb93-8ca0-4556-ae60-11199dc263c2", "b944f77f-113b-4a02-ae5e-d4a124b8fd5b", "c32b12e9-a542-458d-8611-4a22e5193730", "c9fd6571-b93c-4e23-a8dc-f20dc52f21f1", "cb99158c-9fde-4262-9a66-0b74cb0bd828", "de1300b2-5511-47bc-ad8c-5a7aa4274531", "fbb30883-9a80-47e2-ad5a-b1d833c8081c"], "title": "Modeling and Recognition of Landmark Image Collections Using Iconic Scene Graphs", "venue": "european conference on computer vision", "year": 2008, "id": "e8969fe1-e6cf-4bb3-b6d0-f820119d35cf"}

{"abstract": "Peer Data Management Systems (PDMSs) have been introduced as a solution to the problem of large-scale sharing of semantically rich data. A PDMS consists of semantic peers connected through semantic mappings. Querying a PDMS may lead to very poor results, because of the semantic degradation due to the approximations given by the traversal of the semantic mappings, thus leading to the problem of how to boost a network of mappings in a PDMS.   In this paper we propose a strategy for the incremental maintenance of a flexible network organization that clusters together peers which are semantically related in Semantic Overlay Networks (SONs), while maintaining a high degree of node autonomy. Semantic features, a summarized representation of clusters, are stored in a \"light\" structure which effectively assists a newly entering peer when choosing its semantically closest overlay networks. Then, each peer is supported in the selection of its own neighbors within each overlay network according to two policies: Range-based selection and k-NN selection. For both policies, we introduce specific algorithms which exploit a distributed indexing mechanism for efficient network navigation.

Besides providing a stability condition for a general DFS, in the linear case it is proven that, under a non-negativity assumption for the coefficients of the system, the fuzzyfication of the initial conditions does not compromise the stability of the crisp system.

{"abstract": "We present a novel Hough Transform algorithm referred to as Progressive Probabilistic Hough Transform (PPHT). Unlike the Probabilistic HT where Standard HT is performed on a pre-selected fraction of input points, PPHT minimises the amount of computation needed to detect lines by exploiting the difference an the fraction of votes needed to detect reliably lines with different numbers of supporting points. The fraction of points used for voting need not be specified ad hoc or using a priori knowledge, as in the probabilistic HT; it is a function of the inherent complexity of the input data.

{"abstract": "Digital fingerprinting is a technology for enforcing digital rights policies whereby unique labels, known as digital fingerprints, are inserted into content prior to distribution. For multimedia content, fingerprints can be embedded using conventional watermarking techniques that are typically concerned with robustness against a variety of attacks mounted by an individual. These attacks, known as multiuser collusion attacks, provide a cost-effective method for attenuating each of the colluder's fingerprints and poses a real threat to protecting media data and enforcing usage policies. In this article, we review some major design methodologies for collusion-resistant fingerprinting of multimedia and highlight common and unique issues of different fingerprinting techniques. It also provides detailed discussions on the two major classes of fingerprinting strategies, namely, orthogonal fingerprinting and correlated fingerprinting.", "authors": ["Min Wu", "Wade Trappe", "Z.J.

{"abstract": "The PCP theorem [Arora and Safra 1998; Arora et. al. 1998] says that every language in NP has a witness format that can be checked probabilistically by reading only a constant number of bits from the proof. The celebrated equivalence of this theorem and inapproximability of certain optimization problems, due to Feige et al. [1996], has placed the PCP theorem at the heart of the area of inapproximability.   In this work, we present a new proof of the PCP theorem that draws on this equivalence. We give a combinatorial proof for the NP-hardness of approximating a certain constraint satisfaction problem, which can then be reinterpreted to yield the PCP theorem.   Our approach is to consider the  unsat value  of a constraint system, which is the smallest fraction of unsatisfied constraints, ranging over all possible assignments for the underlying variables. We describe a new combinatorial amplification transformation that doubles the unsat-value of a constraint-system, with only a linear blowup in the size of the system. The amplification step causes an increase in alphabet-size that is corrected by a (standard) PCP composition step. Iterative application of these two steps yields a proof for the PCP theorem.   The amplification lemma relies on a new notion of \u201cgraph powering\u201d that can be applied to systems of binary constraints. This powering amplifies the unsat-value of a constraint system provided that the underlying graph structure is an expander.   We also extend our amplification lemma towards construction of assignment testers (alternatively, PCPs of Proximity) which are slightly stronger objects than PCPs. We then construct PCPs and locally-testable codes whose length is linear up to a  polylog  factor, and whose correctness can be probabilistically verified by making a  constant  number of queries. Namely, we prove  SAT  \u2208  PCP   1/2,1 [log 2 ( n \u1e61poly log  n ),  O (1)].", "authors": ["Irit Dinur"], "n_citation": 200, "references": ["02ac14f0-f4a7-44d8-ac6c-c5317d32e4e7", "0564b0b6-bf3f-4486-9f98-86ef8c3e2977", "0dd040aa-d2e6-447d-ad59-c2a19b828c99", "1d10b608-115c-4e56-90fa-b7cf876533a8", "231cb8cb-91b4-4898-bd69-a82bec3d00a0", "36a173db-2928-4c68-a9e5-76dc836745be", "44953298-1843-4864-a9cb-b24b2ea5f165", "44e1d5a7-9a74-4a96-995c-e1b8529f4ce6", "6971ced4-3a4a-4b6b-87f2-77862ba111fd", "6cb2ed10-a409-420f-8454-c07e02ac9cf3", "809ef002-8ff0-49ba-8c60-5d34c64efc9a", "90d625f8-6988-404f-9fa7-2f91fb92de1f", "a91cb86e-2129-44f8-ab27-ada8c579d675", "b4f8981f-2875-411a-9a68-9da6638ab781", "b79ae5da-a6f0-4412-9cfe-c4abda913001", "dd2721ff-3cc4-431e-a926-c53dddd67588", "e2e858f9-e61f-4b23-bbd4-047c5aefe57f", "eb834562-629d-459b-af80-cd6f25d8035f", "eeae5316-400b-48d1-b5a8-4a2d25a96678"], "title": "The PCP theorem by gap amplification", "venue": "Journal of the ACM", "year": 2007, "id": "91bd70e9-3a17-4590-8b51-ff989b9f1cdb"}
{"abstract": "Malware, such as computer viruses, worms, and bots, has been recognized as one of the major security threats in the Internet environment, and a large amount of research and development is taking place to find effective countermeasures. These countermeasures are mainly based on either macroscopic or microscopic analysis. Macroscopic analysis is based on monitoring the network in order to grasp the global trends of malware propagations while microscopic analysis investigates malware executables to identify the details of how they behave. We have been developing the network incident analysis center for tactical emergency response (NICTER), where both kinds of analysis are highly integrated. By integrating and correlating the results from the both two approaches, the nicter binds phenomena, i.e., scans observed by network monitoring with their root causes, i.e., malwares. Previous analysis of malware has mainly focused on their internal behavior in the system. However, in order to achieve such a goal, it is crucial that the microscopic analysis extracts a malware's external behavior towards the network. We propose a novel way to analyze malware behavior: focus closely on the malware's external behavior. A malware sample is executed on a real machine that is connected to a virtual Internet environment called a \"miniature network\". Since this analysis environment is totally isolated from the real Internet, the execution of the sample, unlike in previously proposed methods, causes no further unwanted propagation. Furthermore, the behavioral analysis is carried out in two passes. In the first pass, in order to extract a wider variety of network behaviors from the sample, the miniature network responds as interactively as possible. In the second pass, to make only suitable response that will enable us to concentrate on specific behavior, namely scan behaviors, the miniature network is configured on the basis of the first pass result. We also present concrete analysis results that are gained by using the proposed method.", "authors": ["Daisuke Inoue", "Katsunari Yoshioka", "Masashi Eto", "Yuji Hoshizawa", "Koji Nakao"], "n_citation": 19, "references": ["338ecf9d-fda6-4676-99c2-2678cc5921cd", "839f62b5-ac30-4058-9d41-a1c9504d8443", "bca8037e-b487-4091-8aec-26055ea45f62"], "title": "Malware Behavior Analysis in Isolated Miniature Network for Revealing Malware's Network Activity", "venue": "international conference on communications", "year": 2008, "id": "d486c135-cec8-4f5f-98f0-f698f8d67fb1"}

Expert Finder works in the domain of Java programming, where it relates a user's Java class usage to an independent domain model. User models are automatically generated that allow accurate matching of query to expert without either the novice or expert filling out skill questionnaires.

{"abstract": "The appearance of Agile methods has been the most noticeable change to software process thinking in the last fifteen years [16], but in fact many of the \u201cAgile ideas\u201d have been around since 70\u2019s or even before. Many studies and reviews have been conducted about Agile methods which ascribe their emergence as a reaction against traditional methods. In this paper, we argue that although Agile methods are new as a whole, they have strong roots in the history of software engineering. In addition to the iterative and incremental approaches that have been in use since 1957 [21], people who criticised the traditional methods suggested alternative approaches which were actually Agile ideas such as the response to change, customer involvement, and working software over documentation. The authors of this paper believe that education about the history of Agile thinking will help to develop better understanding as well as promoting the use of Agile methods.

Whenever a block of data needs to be shared. it is spread into both databases, resulting in a block on the original database. and another into the Product database, with special links between them controlled by the Object Manager. These blocks do not need to be maintained identical during the evolution phase of the sharing process. Six types of links were defined, and by choosing one, the designer control the evolution and reintegration of the block in both databases.

However, a large portion of the assigned spectrum is used sporadically and geographical variations in the utilization of assigned spectrum ranges from 15% to 85% with a high variance in time.

The novel functionalities and current research challenges of the xG networks are explained in detail. More specifically, a brief overview of the cognitive radio technology is provided and the xG network architecture is introduced. Moreover, the xG network functions such as spectrum management, spectrum mobility and spectrum sharing are explained in detail.

{"abstract": "One of the most appealing features of multiagent technology is its natural way to modularise a complex system in terms of multiple, interacting and autonomous components. As a natural extension of classes, castes introduced in the formal specification language SLAB provide a language facility that provides modularity in the formal specification of multiagent systems. A caste represents a set of agents of common structural and behavioural characteristics. A caste description defines the tasks that the agents of the caste are capable of, the rules that govern their behaviour, and the environment that they live in. The inheritance relationship between castes defines the sub-group relationship between the agents so that special capabilities and behaviours can be introduced. The instance relationship between an agent and a caste declares that an agent is a member of a caste.

{"abstract": "The essential UML logic diagrams are the class diagrams: they represent the classes of objects that make up a program. Object diagrams are used as the basis to show scenarios of dynamic evolution of the software. The use of object diagrams to depict static structure is very rare. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether the use of static object diagrams can improve the comprehension of software systems. We conducted a study with 17 graduate students during a software engineering course. The students were asked to answer questions about a software system. The system was described either with a class diagram or with both a class diagram and an object diagram. The student asked multiple choice questions on four different systems. This study revealed that there is a statistically significant difference in the comprehension achievement for two of the systems. The effect of the presence of object diagrams can be classified of medium size.

In order to adopt reinforcement learning for such complicated systems, it should be taken not only \"adaptability\" but \"computational efficiencies\" into account.

{"abstract": "Abstract#R##N##R##N#We consider the problem of constructing a map of an unknown environment by an autonomous agent such as a mobile robot. Because accurate positional information is often difficult to ensure, we consider the problem of exploration in the absence of metric (positional) information. Worlds are represented by graphs (not necessarily planar) consisting of a fixed number of discrete places linked by bidirectional paths. We assume the robot can consistently enumerate the edges leaving a vertex (that is, it can assign a cyclic ordering). A mobile robot is assigned the task of creating a topological map, i.e. a graph-like representation of the places in the world and their connectivity, by moving from place to place along the paths it encounters. It can detect edges and count them, but cannot directly sense the labels associated with a place or an edge. In principle, this type of representation could be used for non-spatial environments such as computer networks.#R##N##R##N##R##N##R##N#We present an approach to the exploration of unknown environments for which local sensing information alone is insufficient to distinguish distinct places, based simply on the structure of the world itself. Places are identified by a non-unique signature and by using a collection of such non-unique local signatures, an extended signature may be constructed that determines the robot's position (although in certain \u201cdegenerate\u201d worlds additional information is required). We describe the \u201cexploration tree\u201d as a representation of a collection of alternative descriptions of the environment.

These systems provide all source-destination pairs with end-to-end transparent channels that are identified through a wavelength and a physical path.

We also compute optimal control policies for average, minimax (bottleneck), and average cost-per-task-cycle cost functions. We highlight several interesting cases when optimal policies can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the system and specification.

{"abstract": "This paper describes the C Intermediate Language: a high-level representation along with a set of tools that permit easy analysis and source-to-source transformation of C programs.Compared to C, CIL has fewer constructs. It breaks down certain complicated constructs of C into simpler ones, and thus it works at a lower level than abstract-syntax trees. But CIL is also more high-level than typical intermediate languages (e.g., three-address code) designed for compilation. As a result, what we have is a representation that makes it easy to analyze and manipulate C programs, and emit them in a form that resembles the original source. Moreover, it comes with a front-end that translates to CIL not only ANSI C programs but also those using Microsoft C or GNU C extensions.We describe the structure of CIL with a focus on how it disambiguates those features of C that we found to be most confusing for program analysis and transformation. We also describe a whole-program merger based on structural type equality, allowing a complete project to be viewed as a single compilation unit. As a representative application of CIL, we show a transformation aimed at making code immune to stack-smashing attacks. We are currently using CIL as part of a system that analyzes and instruments C programs with run-time checks to ensure type safety.

{"abstract": "Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are being used for a number of applications involving infrastructure monitoring, building energy monitoring and industrial sensing. The difficulty of programming individual sensor nodes and the associated overhead have encouraged researchers to design macro-programming systems which can help program the network as a whole or as a combination of subnets. Most of the current macro-programming schemes do not support multiple users seamlessly deploying diverse applications on the same shared sensor network. As WSNs are becoming more common, it is important to provide such support, since it enables higher-level optimizations such as code reuse, energy savings, and traffic reduction. In this paper, we propose a macro-programming framework called Nano-CF, which, in addition to supporting in-network programming, allows multiple applications written by different programmers to be executed simultaneously on a sensor networking infrastructure. This framework enables the use of a common sensing infrastructure for a number of applications without the users being concerned about the applications already deployed on the network. The framework also supports timing constraints and resource reservations using the Nano-RK operating system. Nano-CF is efficient at improving WSN performance by (a) combining multiple user programs, (b) aggregating packets for data delivery, and (c) satisfying timing and energy specifications using Rate-Harmonized Scheduling. Using representative applications, we demonstrate that Nano-CF achieves 90% reduction in Source Lines-of-Code (SLoC) and 50% energy savings from aggregated data delivery.", "authors": ["Vikram Gupta", "Junsung Kim", "Aditi Pandya", "Karthik Lakshmanan", "Ragunathan Rajkumar", "Eduardo Tovar"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0d4d0363-07b5-43b6-976d-955e96044709", "1469c699-b1bc-475b-890b-8b27b3aa1ecb", "448ed536-bff4-486d-a087-6608bf307945", "612910b7-24f8-4f67-9d3d-a2814b7c15f8", "640f1bd1-91dd-41fe-9302-3fb131259046", "67da4a35-8cac-426d-b162-b99d3f9a13c5", "7bc745f3-ec8c-4c87-8f71-f64a1f7bda8e", "862df74a-5677-4d77-a0de-a48de1fafb8d", "aca9066f-9450-45ba-9de1-b6070d848c79", "af81ea06-c920-4f0b-9d6f-4d6edbe639fa", "b02a7fb7-cbf2-4d57-b957-b4260436f4d3", "b214e042-9327-42b1-b3b0-d4412beec147", "b5b8132d-0a8c-4e6c-999f-839f0cef48b7", "c2f3efb9-26cc-4274-a075-2b6f847e2589", "c5560c22-c1e4-4ab7-9263-0d12c0a5e58a", "cb8247ad-c4fe-4e6d-95c0-155d29a90bcf", "dbfcf1f3-ddf0-4d17-a362-7d3521578e2a", "dcbfc0d3-a8d0-4e87-9095-bd5abb6d354f", "e7323ca6-7a17-4b89-9f95-a8b4fe414450", "ecbe0a0d-5a07-4023-acdc-95d4e47dc5cd", "efa04de8-fec3-4c73-8031-5b7990b88e57", "fe1e35cd-ab3b-498e-a28d-b10f4ac03265"], "title": "Nano-CF: A coordination framework for macro-programming in Wireless Sensor Networks", "venue": "sensor mesh and ad hoc communications and networks", "year": 2011, "id": "c3e598d1-bd90-4b9e-b71d-a16a318ef5b4"}

We consider the linearized Ginzburg--Landau equation, which models, for instance, vortex shedding in bluff body flows.

The kernel of the operator is shown to be twice continuously differentiable, and a series approximation for its solution is given. Under certain conditions on the parameters of the Ginzburg--Landau equation, compatible with vortex shedding modelling on a semi-infinite domain, the kernel is shown to have compact support, resulting in partial state feedback.

{"abstract": "Data preprocessing (transformation) plays an important role in data mining and machine learning. In this study, we investigate the effect of four different preprocessing methods to fault-proneness prediction using nine datasets from NASA Metrics Data Programs (MDP) and ten classification algorithms. Our experiments indicate that  log  transformation rarely improves classification performance, but discretization affects the performance of many different algorithms.

Boosting and NaiveBayes perform significantly better with discretized data. We conclude that no general benefit can be expected from data transformations.

{"abstract": "We describe the development of a computational cognitive model that explains navigation behavior on the World Wide Web. The model, called SNIF-ACT (Scent-based Navigation and Information Foraging in the ACT cognitive architecture), is motivated by Information Foraging Theory (IFT), which quantifies the perceived relevance of a Web link to a user's goal by a spreading activation mechanism. The model assumes that users evaluate links on a Web page sequentially and decide to click on a link or to go back to the previous page by a Bayesian satisficing model (BSM) that adaptively evaluates and selects actions based on a combination of previous and current assessments of the relevance of link texts to information goals. SNIF-ACT 1.0 utilizes the measure of utility, called information scent, derived from IFT to predict rankings of links on different Web pages. The model was tested against a detailed set of protocol data collected from 8 participants as they engaged in two information-seeking tasks using the World Wide Web. The model provided a good match to participants' link selections. In SNIF-ACT 2.0, we included the adaptive link selection mechanism from the BSM that sequentially evaluates links on a Web page. The mechanism allowed the model to dynamically build up the aspiration levels of actions in a satisficing process (e.g., to follow a link or leave a Web site) as it sequential assessed link texts on a Web page. The dynamic mechanism provides an integrated account of how and when users decide to click on a link or leave a page based on the sequential, ongoing experiences with the link context on current and previous Web pages. SNIF-ACT 2.0 was validated on a data set obtained from 74 subjects. Monte Carlo simulations of the model showed that SNIF-ACT 2.0 provided better fits to human data than SNIF-ACT 1.0 and a Position model that used position of links on a Web page to decide which link to select. We conclude that the combination of the IFT and the BSM provides a good description of user-Web interaction. Practical implications of the model are discussed.", "authors": ["Wai-Tat Fu", "Peter Pirolli"], "n_citation": 285, "references": ["097ed8b2-735f-4b13-bd6f-e153b569856c", "0bf10ae2-e3e6-4f0d-b223-c196bbfe44a3", "1c02a29e-3620-4acb-9d89-c5677fb35001", "29010e7e-e4b2-4e26-89ff-e88d49c459a5", "342e9d88-08a7-4050-8e81-a7586b373e07", "4377224e-9e5b-4329-89de-c2898b09021f", "5aa7a001-6729-419c-a8e2-d8564dedaf06", "5c15dbd7-e413-4e67-bba2-88639fb0fa5f", "5e91f696-a438-4c37-ab99-3ea30d2c4d24", "6f11f970-823c-446b-ba53-677424cd8149", "88fcb30a-92a1-4906-8115-83a38364fa83", "adaaafab-aa7a-4b1e-842d-e29c8c2f049b", "b08bc91a-c57a-4c94-b2e8-ca98fbfcfbc2", "b8a11e3d-e329-43b4-8713-64707ad7a957", "bc95970b-34c5-4860-a832-41bc04a50889", "bd4e2559-c80d-4720-bdcd-8e0bb7bf355e", "cc1db020-54d4-4e07-a7f5-0612e8f6a730", "df90477f-3da7-4abc-96f2-3769b7d6fb29", "f470a8f4-40cd-40ab-9fcc-3a9c2b548a32", "f7b7d1d5-e53e-42fc-88d9-aa7440fc3599", "f9ecd9fb-dcba-478f-a69b-9723478794c2", "fcc28285-92e3-4dfb-943e-e92e552ead31"], "title": "SNIF-ACT: a cognitive model of user navigation on the world wide web", "venue": "Human-Computer Interaction", "year": 2007, "id": "e822f4ca-1a62-42ee-8d4e-c7f74b4b31d1"}

We formalize the notion of protection from partiality in the context of specification languages like VDM-SL and COLD-K.

{"abstract": "Optic Disc (OD) localization is an important pre-processing step that significantly simplifies subsequent segmentation of the OD and other retinal structures. Current OD localization techniques suffer from impractically-high computation times (few minutes per image). In this work, we present a fast technique that requires less than a second to localize the OD. The technique is based upon obtaining two projections of certain image features that encode the x- and y- coordinates of the OD. The resulting 1-D projections are then searched to determine the location of the OD. This avoids searching the 2-D image space and, thus, enhances the speed of the OD localization process. Image features such as retinal vessels orientation and the OD brightness are used in the current method. Four publicly-available databases, including STARE and DRIVE, are used to evaluate the proposed technique. The OD was successfully located in 330 images out of 340 images (97%) with an average computation time of 0.65 s.", "authors": ["Ahmed Essam Mahfouz", "Ahmed S.

{"abstract": "This paper describes a new approach to telepresence which realizes virtual tours into a visualized dynamic real world without significant time delay. We propose a novel concept ofinstantourwhich enables us to instantly look around a visualized space of a dynamic real world. Theinstantouris realized by the following two steps: (1) video-rate omnidirectional image acquisition and (2) real-time view-dependent perspective image generation from an omnidirectional video stream. The proposed technique is applicable to real-time telepresence in the situation where the real world to be seen is far from an observation site, because the time delay from the change of viewing direction to the change of displayed image does not depend on the actual distance between both sites. Moreover, multiple users can look around from a single viewpoint in a visualized dynamic real world in different directions at the same time. The proposed technique is also useful for another type of telepresence which uses recorded omnidirectional video streams.

{"abstract": "Non-functional requirements (NFRs), such as security and cost, are generally subjective and oftentimes synergistic or conflicting with each other. Properly dealing with such NFRs requires a large body of knowledge \u2013 goals to be achieved, problems or obstacles to be avoided, alternative solutions to mitigate the problems, and the best compromising alternative solution to be selected. However, few patterns exist for dealing with these kinds of knowledge of NFRs. In this paper, we present four kinds of NFR patterns for capturing and reusing knowledge of NFRs \u2013 objective pattern, problem pattern, alternatives pattern and selection pattern. NFR patterns may be visually represented, and organized by rules of specialization to create more specific patterns, of composition to build larger patterns, and of instantiation to create new patterns using existing patterns as templates.

{"abstract": "The problem of determining the proper size of an artificial neural network is recognized to be crucial, especially for its practical implications in such important issues as learning and generalization. One popular approach for tackling this problem is commonly known as pruning and it consists of training a larger than necessary network and then removing unnecessary weights/nodes. In this paper, a new pruning method is developed, based on the idea of iteratively eliminating units and adjusting the remaining weights in such a way that the network performance does not worsen over the entire training set. The pruning problem is formulated in terms of solving a system of linear equations, and a very efficient conjugate gradient algorithm is used for solving it, in the least-squares sense. The algorithm also provides a simple criterion for choosing the units to be removed, which has proved to work well in practice. The results obtained over various test problems demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.", "authors": ["Giovanna Castellano", "Anna Maria Fanelli", "Marcello Pelillo"], "n_citation": 265, "references": ["0428c35c-29f7-463e-b606-33b460a77b17", "067c1b82-f8ba-4408-92b7-25ef979d9340", "2f5adf78-25e5-42e4-9a6c-435617f57387", "3edec1a7-2079-4813-87e2-4ca44f947da7", "3fff50e3-6a11-415b-8c8d-6f2c651f658d", "6372b6b3-4826-4338-b4c3-1cd5bd9fc8b7", "645aa038-913b-4ef7-8faa-8bfde75e74f6", "75fe5f3d-61d0-4db3-81d4-bcf513c4a2e5", "8633f8aa-863e-4916-a8aa-a624cc88234f", "91f241a5-5469-48e6-aa0c-9ce0ea9640c6", "a2bad1ba-1819-46ad-86be-fa65d7fa7e29", "a530b2e9-d9af-464a-a9ea-aea3031b5b95", "a9d2a35b-0909-44b3-9f10-9fb1d4d8bd88", "cfb53d0d-ac29-4e8b-abb8-03b20288f519", "e57d5178-eb38-4375-90ef-e9286d033c86", "ea294286-3cc2-4979-a22b-2fbb78c2ef18", "ee06eb12-1cf5-4b1c-88c2-1bfbe423ac68"], "title": "An iterative pruning algorithm for feedforward neural networks", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks", "year": 1997, "id": "6698a29d-42cc-4616-baea-75218c6aef36"}
{"abstract": "One of the benefits of finite-state verification (FSV) tools, such as model checkers, is that a counterexample is provided when the property cannot be verified. Not all counterexamples, however, are equally useful to the analysts trying to understand and localize the fault. Often counterexamples are so long that they are hard to understand. Thus, it is important for FSV tools to find short counterexamples and to do so quickly. Commonly used search strategies, such as breadth-first and depth-first search, do not usually perform well in both of these dimensions. In this paper, we investigate heuristic-guided search strategies for the FSV tool FLAVERS and propose a novel two-stage counterexample search strategy. We describe an experiment showing that this two-stage strategy, when combined with appropriate heuristics, is extremely effective at quickly finding short counterexamples for a large set of verification problems.", "authors": ["Jianbin Tan", "George S.

{"abstract": "Today, most multi-connected autonomous systems (AS) need to control the flow of their interdomain traffic for both performance and economical reasons. This is usually done by manually tweaking the BGP configurations of the routers on an error-prone trial-and-error basis. In this paper, we demonstrate that designing systematic BGP-based traffic engineering techniques for stub ASes are possible. Our approach to solve this traffic engineering problem is to allow the network operator to define objective functions on the interdomain traffic. Those objective functions are used by an optimization box placed inside the AS that controls the interdomain traffic by tuning the iBGP messages distributed inside the AS. We show that the utilization of an efficient evolutionary algorithm allows to both optimize the objective function and limit the number of iBGP messages. By keeping a lifetime on the tweaked routes, we also show that providing stability to the interdomain path followed by the traffic is possible. We evaluate the performance of solution based on traffic traces from two stub ASes of different sizes. Our simulations show that the interdomain traffic can be efficiently engineered by using not more than a few iBGP advertisements per minute.Our contribution in this paper is to demonstrate that by carefully thinking the design of the interdomain traffic engineering technique, stub ASes can engineer their outbound traffic over relatively short timescales, by exclusively tweaking their BGP routes, and with a minimal burden on BGP. Systematic BGP-based traffic engineering for stub ASes is thus possible at a very limited cost in terms of iBGP messages.", "authors": ["Steve Uhlig", "Olivier Bonaventure"], "n_citation": 53, "references": ["038e6896-9a27-41cc-bacb-de3bea520f3b", "08188609-efda-4b54-ad07-da2740a6dcd8", "1a34752a-1657-4939-a2fc-8b2b4d46f7da", "20fe0cfa-cb8f-4b19-82f7-b15fe65dc0bb", "349f5b93-4f6e-4fb4-b022-dc3e6a633858", "3d02b614-3aa0-4647-9e95-8e3fde4c4371", "4ce5b502-a7a9-4425-a9e9-e783ccb2c970", "5b174a8f-fb67-4b91-9830-c436daa57fc1", "5df5ea75-9e20-4532-a3e5-ad5871d866ab", "62964215-1ef0-48af-b6cb-02a893bcfdf7", "6899792e-b0ce-45ad-82b5-4f425958a8ec", "8cbb609a-12e4-4d5a-a6ce-5187ab5b3974", "92ccb3e8-bf8f-44f8-aa09-df54727fc783", "9eefedc7-f183-4f16-bbb6-f05218c066b6", "9feaddaa-9617-4a09-82da-3a4f6df8557a", "a0066090-4938-4c55-9ff6-fe77004dc48e", "a858fe0c-3ede-4027-9d83-320d0d033e67", "d8d45f06-8f07-4d67-919d-46071c69593f", "da235f44-0e10-40f5-85a5-19768431c579", "e924b398-7828-4d8e-88c1-0450585cb6b9", "fa4f195e-43fa-4b49-9c25-21c8045db136", "feedda98-05f6-42d8-83ba-17838df08bc2"], "title": "Designing BGP-based outbound traffic engineering techniques for stub ASes", "venue": "acm special interest group on data communication", "year": 2004, "id": "381c0d70-2279-4b09-950b-41147d1e4bd5"}

This paper proposes a fundamentally different approach, dubbed \"Hyper-Q\" Learning, in which values of mixed strategies rather than base actions are learned, and in which other agents' strategies are estimated from observed actions via Bayesian inference. Hyper-Q may be effective against many different types of adaptive agents, even if they are persistently dynamic. Against certain broad categories of adaptation, it is argued that Hyper-Q may converge to exact optimal time-varying policies.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we propose a differential evolution (DE) based two-stage evolutionary approach for named entity recognition (NER). The first stage concerns with the problem of relevant feature selection for NER within the frameworks of two popular machine learning algorithms, namely Conditional Random Field (CRF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The solutions of the final best population provides different diverse set of classifiers; some are effective with respect to recall whereas some are effective with respect to precision. In the second stage we propose a novel technique for classifier ensemble for combining these classifiers. The approach is very general and can be applied for any classification problem. Currently we evaluate the proposed algorithm for NER in three popular Indian languages, namely Bengali, Hindi and Telugu. In order to maintain the domain-independence property the features are selected and developed mostly without using any deep domain knowledge and/or language dependent resources. Experimental results show that the proposed two stage technique attains the final F-measure values of 88.89%, 88.09% and 76.63% for Bengali, Hindi and Telugu, respectively.

{"abstract": "Social (or folksonomic) tagging has become a very popular way to describe, categorise, search, discover and navigate content within Web 2.0 websites. Unlike taxonomies, which overimpose a hierarchical categorisation of content, folksonomies empower end users by enabling them to freely create and choose the categories (in this case, tags) that best describe some content. However, as tags are informally defined, continually changing, and ungoverned, social tagging has often been criticised for lowering, rather than increasing, the efficiency of searching, due to the number of synonyms, homonyms, polysemy, as well as the heterogeneity of users and the noise they introduce. In this paper, we propose Social Ranking, a method that exploits recommender system techniques to increase the efficiency of searches within Web 2.0. We measure users' similarity based on their past tag activity. We infer tags' relationships based on their association to content. We then propose a mechanism to answer a user's query that ranks (recommends) content based on the inferred semantic distance of the query to the tags associated to such content, weighted by the similarity of the querying user to the users who created those tags. A thorough evaluation conducted on the CiteULike dataset demonstrates that Social Ranking neatly improves coverage, while not compromising on accuracy.", "authors": ["Valentina Zanardi", "Licia Capra"], "n_citation": 188, "references": ["01cd69ee-9646-451c-9a64-68c94c63f5bb", "0314113d-62b6-4b5a-954d-bd18f8beb2fa", "09245b19-73a8-4e08-9f8b-ebddf8ff67cb", "17fbbb03-8b91-4ea6-af29-9fc8fd1f4364", "1e732ebf-3faf-4fa0-8635-2d68a6738432", "2435f784-be52-48fd-bae9-774517c18700", "32dde439-5bfa-48c7-90bf-fa937f188157", "41350086-4320-45bb-a93c-be68975bfff5", "60abaa5a-7f1d-47d0-83e8-cc8d9c04bef4", "61de88c4-f8ea-4eb8-84f0-3d12e3c13e4c", "69a472ba-e209-4634-9d88-bcb128dba4a4", "6f0c48c1-4dd1-4326-ae57-22882e68c5f6", "8952ee5a-1273-4595-8388-76cf57d28e4d", "a74c070e-5a43-41eb-96ea-796bcfa8eac7", "be08e681-3510-447e-8ef3-2ae0cabca2f0", "c9d4071b-8733-46af-a9b0-1a98bd2dbe79", "d7d7b489-42f9-40e7-af94-7a219ce74b16", "df2f8ba3-5b3a-4f6e-a79a-6173423da622", "e4d50619-5c54-4189-9cb5-ee700d00fbe7", "ed4c0d5d-5152-4915-b9bd-d0bd25f82674"], "title": "Social ranking: uncovering relevant content using tag-based recommender systems", "venue": "conference on recommender systems", "year": 2008, "id": "fe6fefa8-020d-4629-8590-c539c6ff5b64"}
{"abstract": "In typed object-oriented languages the subtype relation is typically based on the inheritance hierarchy. This approach, however, leads either to insecure type-systems or to restrictions on inheritance that make it less flexible than untyped Smalltalk inheritance. We present a new typed model of inheritance that allows more of the flexibility of Smalltalk inheritance within a statically-typed system. Significant features of our analysis are the introduction of polymorphism into the typing of inheritance and the uniform application of inheritance to objects, classes and types. The resulting notion of  type inheritance  allows us to show that the type of an inherited object is an inherited type but not always a subtype.", "authors": ["William R. Cook", "Walter L.

We discuss an interface agent prototype that is designed to support human-human communication in virtual environments. The prototype interacts with users strategically during conversation, spending most of its time listening. The prototype mimics a party host, trying to find a safe common topic for guests whose conversation has lagged. We performed an experimental evaluation of the prototype's ability to assist in cross-cultural conversations. We designed the prototype to introduce safe or unsafe topics to conversation pairs, through a series of questions and suggestions. The agent made positive contributions to participants' experience of the conversation, influenced their perception of each other and of each others' national group, and even seemed to effect their style of behavior.

{"abstract": "Consider n parties having local inputs x1x2,....xn respectively, and wishing to compute the value f(x1,... ,xn). where f is a predetermined function. Loosely speaking, an n-party protocol for this purpose has maximum privacy if whatever a subset of the users can efficiently compute when participating in the protocol, they can also compute from their local inputs and the value f(x1,...,xn).Recently, Goldreich, Micali and Wigderson have presented a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a Turing machine for computing the function f, outputs an n-party protocol with maximum privacy for distributively computing f (x1,....,xn The maximum privacy protocol output uses as a subprotocol a maximum privacy two-party protocol for computing a particular simple function P1(?). More recently, Haber and Micali have improved the efficiency of the above n-party protocols, using a maximum privacy two-party protocol for computing another particular function P2(?). Both works use a general result of Yao in order to implement protocols for the particular functions p1 and p2.In this paper, we present direct solutions to the above two particular protocol problems, avoiding the use of Yao's general result. In fact, we present two alternative approaches for solving both problems. The first approach consists of a simple reduction of these two problems to a variant of Oblivious Transfer. The second approach consists of designing direct solutions to these two problems, assuming the intractability of the Quadratic Residuosity problem. Both approaches yield simpler and more efficient solutions than the ones obtained by Yao's result.", "authors": ["Oded Goldreich", "Ronen Vainish"], "n_citation": 175, "references": ["0dd040aa-d2e6-447d-ad59-c2a19b828c99", "1f3ec374-950e-4ad7-a9c8-70bb7717a19a", "7225aced-64d3-4dc6-b491-7eb2739b8828", "ca394e6a-59e0-466c-a66a-d976555db689"], "title": "How to Solve any Protocol Problem - An Efficiency Improvement", "venue": "international cryptology conference", "year": 1987, "id": "10d9563a-ecce-499b-8426-a8deb25caa38"}

About 8000 lines of C and 60 lines of assembler are comprised in the ORIENTAIS. The operating system is of vital importance to embedded systems, especially for some time sensitive and accurate controlling applications just like automotive applications. We prove that the implementation of ORIENTAIS application programming interfaces strictly follow the OSEK/VDX specification which we formalized from natrual language expressed OSEK/VDX specification. Meanwhile, we model the high level interaction behaviors with CSP and verify the properties just like deadlock-free. To guarantee the safety of memory access and bounded response time with interrupt program involved, binary code level verification is developed based on xBIL which is a binary intermediate language we proposed. We introduce a series of techniques and approaches for verifying the ORIENTAIS. Our approach is an efficient work for the verification of ORIENTAIS, with whose help several bugs are detected.

{"abstract": "Boolean control networks (BCNs) are recently attracting considerable interest as computational models for genetic and cellular networks. Addressing control-theoretic problems in BCNs may lead to a better understanding of the intrinsic control in biological systems, as well as to developing suitable protocols for manipulating biological systems using exogenous inputs. We introduce two definitions for controllability of a BCN, and show that a necessary and sufficient condition for each form of controllability is that a certain nonnegative matrix is irreducible or primitive, respectively. Our analysis is based on a result that may be of independent interest, namely, a simple algebraic formula for the number of different control sequences that steer a BCN between given initial and final states in a given number of time steps, while avoiding a set of forbidden states.", "authors": ["Dmitriy Laschov", "Michael Margaliot"], "n_citation": 48, "references": ["0c9d27ba-57b1-4e94-9e35-bc69149b487b", "0fd94cd6-3702-47e8-be09-b6525c95e335", "36b8a7e5-d0dc-47f3-b1f9-24d0b1277ca0", "4e9bf1ab-e2f4-4c46-9b8a-dddf483a9fef", "5ccc76f5-fbbd-482d-a46f-fe945ff32fb7", "70c9e07b-c50a-44b9-9b1d-e9f73d0f4f34", "7ca1d8b8-f2ea-4ba5-85b0-8e3b01b941b7", "7cc850ea-b620-41c1-9abb-1cc633609b9b", "81a7c7dc-a77c-4683-bd6e-a7152b1b99f2", "884db50b-003c-4f71-a5f3-ea0b3080cc98", "abccbf33-1ffa-41a7-8ff3-a3d072f6802e", "b526d5a6-21f5-4c79-8f79-9b3b1b37f168", "c0d04ef9-e636-40ee-8f92-b88fc0e03bbf", "d8b88f6f-5230-4e45-b878-b04f760337ab", "e6e4f36d-1751-425c-9b7d-4a142b829478", "eab8e89a-971b-4c2d-8842-6d5a02884c59", "f49da8ba-88b8-4c79-8538-dfba75baf4a0"], "title": "Brief paper: Controllability of Boolean control networks via the Perron-Frobenius theory", "venue": "Automatica", "year": 2012, "id": "81699c77-221c-41f9-979b-954bf52408bb"}
{"abstract": "Many recent computational photography techniques decompose an image into a piecewise smooth base layer, containing large scale variations in intensity, and a residual detail layer capturing the smaller scale details in the image. In many of these applications, it is important to control the spatial scale of the extracted details, and it is often desirable to manipulate details at multiple scales, while avoiding visual artifacts.   In this paper we introduce a new way to construct edge-preserving multi-scale image decompositions. We show that current basedetail decomposition techniques, based on the bilateral filter, are limited in their ability to extract detail at arbitrary scales. Instead, we advocate the use of an alternative edge-preserving smoothing operator, based on the weighted least squares optimization framework, which is particularly well suited for progressive coarsening of images and for multi-scale detail extraction. After describing this operator, we show how to use it to construct edge-preserving multi-scale decompositions, and compare it to the bilateral filter, as well as to other schemes. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our edge-preserving decompositions in the context of LDR and HDR tone mapping, detail enhancement, and other applications.", "authors": ["Zeev Farbman", "Raanan Fattal", "Dani Lischinski", "Richard Szeliski"], "n_citation": 769, "references": ["0803f987-5ed2-497e-ac37-e42475b15c94", "09eb43e1-3d93-4601-83c7-b53878fb0a62", "0c32535a-72bb-4fda-b12b-627147f8b358", "111429dc-8001-411c-a585-1287dfe89f81", "3010b25b-5f2c-4f37-8344-a38be9d09686", "311f4d3b-b903-4676-a20d-82084f41bcfa", "34d4e37b-e575-4316-847b-d8a661b51473", "48b2f9f3-f780-4f6b-95b9-b650bb93ef65", "5634ed19-8ebb-4152-b432-b7356acaf978", "56dcd94f-3b81-4a1e-98ad-625d521036f8", "590d61ae-8694-4255-8063-c87be15b553e", "5ffd3dd8-ebda-4bba-8b10-1ff37c11f29f", "65a0e07c-396a-4462-a7dc-f32590d80e62", "73e49fb8-9519-4d4f-88c3-fc5f107bd00e", "744de9c6-bb83-44e4-9290-ba0d4dba8eda", "74c86bf5-ef87-44eb-bf4f-8589e6257b6e", "7793a43d-e9d4-4d48-b455-f621b177c31a", "7bf3ce7f-cfb8-40ba-82af-122576d8ccff", "82477d30-6594-4ea8-a16e-2ce7318f3071", "875f9a92-af0a-4a1b-8d1a-6dc5cfba544e", "aa2ab92b-210a-4f00-925b-a3c30eec43f7", "ae500e2e-12c6-4dbd-9c8a-c0d696a4a685", "b3527d67-9dc9-49d2-a93a-7b945a76ed55", "b608af66-6368-44dc-a670-2a3e42561ee1", "b7fdfb26-0f3b-49c4-9d49-538c58d8620a", "be8f13bc-3cdc-4fb2-9e0c-9603d7446bdb", "c4d5e0c0-1769-4939-b708-1353ce4a29bf", "c8f80ea6-4602-458c-9a70-daf1c646c89b", "c9c78d28-e50f-4872-ae6f-da2a1386534f", "cd2cb3e1-a12d-47e3-b026-f29ae8185c3b", "d8724090-f07d-44e9-87ab-ecb0dfa20c5d", "eb5d970e-5102-4641-ac30-785f8d466e8c", "eefbda17-25b8-484a-aa7a-5ebf5fea2cc3"], "title": "Edge-preserving decompositions for multi-scale tone and detail manipulation", "venue": "international conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques", "year": 2008, "id": "9abfc8ec-feb6-4bc7-a067-b1d113c70773"}
{"abstract": "Kikuuwe and Fujimoto have introduced proxy-based sliding mode control. It combines responsive and accurate tracking during normal operation with smooth, slow recovery from large position errors that can sometimes occur after abnormal events. The method can be seen as an extension to both conventional PID control and sliding mode control. In this paper, proxy-based sliding mode control is used to control a 2-DOF planar manipulator actuated by pleated pneumatic artificial muscles (PPAMs). The principal advantage of this control method is increased safety for people interacting with the manipulator. Two different forms of proxy-based sliding mode control were implemented on the system, and their performance was experimentally evaluated. Both forms performed very well with respect to safety. Good tracking was also obtained, especially with the second form.", "authors": ["M. Van Damme", "Bram Vanderborght", "R.

{"abstract": "Robustly tracking people in visual scenes is an important task for surveillance, human-computer interfaces and visually mediated interaction. Existing attempts at tracking a person's head and hands deal with ambiguity, uncertainty and noise by intrinsically assuming a consistently continuous visual stream and/or exploiting depth information. We present a method for tracking the head and hands of a human subject from a single view with no constraints on the continuity of motion. Hence the tracker is appropriate for real-time applications in which the availability of visual data is constrained, and motion is discontinuous.

{"abstract": "This paper describes the MPEG-4 standard, as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-2. The MPEG-4 visual standard is developed to provide users a new level of interaction with visual contents. It provides technologies to view, access and manipulate objects rather than pixels, with great error robustness at a large range of bit-rates. Application areas range from digital television, streaming video, to mobile multimedia and games. The MPEG-4 natural video standard consists of a collection of tools that support these application areas. The standard provides tools for shape coding, motion estimation and compensation, texture coding, error resilience, sprite coding and scalability. Conformance points in the form of object types, profiles and levels, provide the basis for interoperability. Shape coding can be performed in binary mode, where the shape of each object is described by a binary mask, or in gray scale mode, where the shape is described in a form similar to an alpha channel, allowing transparency, and reducing aliasing. Motion compensation is block based, with appropriate modifications for object boundaries. The block size can be 16\u00d716, or 8\u00d78, with half pixel resolution. MPEG-4 also provides a mode for overlapped motion compensation. Texture coding is based in 8\u00d78 DCT, with appropriate modifications for object boundary blocks. Coefficient prediction is possible to improve coding efficiency. Static textures can be encoded using a wavelet transform. Error resilience is provided by resynchronization markers, data partitioning, header extension codes, and reversible variable length codes. Scalability is provided for both spatial and temporal resolution enhancement. MPEG-4 provides scalability on an object basis, with the restriction that the object shape has to be rectangular. MPEG-4 conformance points are defined at the Simple Profile, the Core Profile, and the Main Profile. Simple Profile and Core Profiles address typical scene sizes of QCIF and CIF size, with bit-rates of 64, 128, 384 and 2 Mbit/s. Main Profile addresses a typical scene sizes of CIF, ITU-R 601 and HD, with bit-rates at 2, 15 and 38.4 Mbit/s.", "authors": ["Touradj Ebrahimi", "Caspar Horne"], "n_citation": 218, "references": ["7076d71b-e504-49af-ad35-cd1f2d12f5d6", "dfa94934-2dce-4db0-bf42-4b73bdefacd4", "e265d8be-11cf-4b4e-ad11-9e51441f4547"], "title": "MPEG-4 natural video coding \u2013 An overview", "venue": "Signal Processing-image Communication", "year": 2000, "id": "57c5c794-8b7e-4fc2-a0e1-87a8993589e8"}

{"abstract": "DC-DC converters pose challenging hybrid control problems, since the semiconductor switches induce different modes of operation and several constraints (on the duty cycle and the inductor current) are present. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to the modeling and controller design problem for fixed-frequency DC-DC converters, using a synchronous step-down DC-DC converter as an illustrative example. We introduce a hybrid converter model that is valid for the whole operating regime. Based on this model, we formulate and solve a constrained optimal control problem. To make the scheme implementable, we derive offline the explicit state-feedback control law, which can be easily stored and implemented in a lookup table. A Kalman filter is added to account for unmeasured load variations and to achieve zero steady-state output voltage error. An a posteriori analysis proves, by deriving a piecewise-quadratic Lyapunov function, that the closed-loop system is exponentially stable. Simulation results demonstrate the potential advantages of the proposed control methodology.", "authors": ["Tobias Geyer", "Georgios Papafotiou", "Manfred Morari"], "n_citation": 121, "references": ["03f8dc50-1aa6-4acf-9c53-8708c850af9e", "07bb713f-4c1b-4c9c-8a9c-52837b39e06f", "1c1c46a9-9b83-4279-bb05-e98c7476cc2e", "21c52811-2f6d-4d57-8c9e-d79ff6c1c6a4", "2d6db51d-d8bb-4360-9a1b-9e013aa1fa41", "3e7a4b12-6ee4-40aa-944f-f93f854784d8", "4a796877-822e-405e-a0ee-78c7aad40697", "4c490f7e-5efa-45d0-b9f8-aa24f6bede66", "747c9434-a43c-4b15-aa41-b01d54301af4", "932e813e-f8cf-4b84-b16a-6c8f8c905501", "fe68283e-5773-4c97-8fd7-9ef437bbb75a"], "title": "Hybrid Model Predictive Control of the Step-Down DC\u2013DC Converter", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Control Systems and Technology", "year": 2008, "id": "d7a74298-376f-4d85-b923-4d85a673b222"}

{"abstract": "Two factors contribute to the difficulty of testing scientific software. One is the lack of testing oracles - a means of comparing software output to expected and correct results. The second is the large number of tests required when following any standard testing technique described in the software engineering literature. Due to the lack of oracles, scientists use judgment based on experience to assess trustworthiness, rather than correctness, of their software. This is an approach well established for assessing scientific models. However, the problem of assessing software is more complex, exacerbated by the problem of code faults. This highlights the need for effective and efficient testing for code faults in scientific software. Our current research suggests that a small number of well chosen tests may reveal a high percentage of code faults in scientific software and allow scientists to increase their trust.", "authors": ["Daniel Hook", "Diane Kelly"], "n_citation": 13, "references": ["17df70e7-0407-455e-a2e5-eee26012f400", "31916a3f-5247-44ae-b32c-fdc7cab42f16", "59586212-daad-4012-ae68-6496483b5f01", "6153e1a3-0c17-49d6-bde9-240db2a42c40", "ba7de62b-5afc-4198-b7fb-526063cc8158"], "title": "Testing for trustworthiness in scientific software", "venue": "computational science and engineering", "year": 2009, "id": "14657db8-fd50-400e-850f-ccd9b066f59a"}
{"abstract": "In this paper we explore the bias in TCP/IP networks against connections with multiple congested gateways. We consider the interaction between the bias against connections with multiple congested gateways, the bias of the TCP window modification algorithm against connections with longer roundtrip times, and the bias of Drop Tail and Random Drop gateways against bursty traffic. Using simulations and a heuristic analysis, we show that in a network with the window modification algorithm in 4.3 tahoe BSD TCP and with Random Drop or Drop Tail gateways, a longer connection with multiple congested gateways can receive unacceptably low throughput. We show that in a network with no bias against connections with longer roundtrip times and with no bias against bursty traffic, a connection with multiple congested gateways can receive an acceptable level of throughput.We discuss the application of several current measures of fairness to networks with multiple congested gateways, and show that different measures of fairness have quite different implications. One view is that each connection should receive the same throughput in bytes/second, regardless of roundtrip times or numbers of congested gateways. Another view is that each connection should receive the same share of the network's scarce congested resources. In general, we believe that the fairness criteria for connections with multiple congested gateways requires further consideration.", "authors": ["Sally Floyd"], "n_citation": 173, "references": ["035cf122-5f4c-476d-8615-88ad3225bc45", "04152951-934d-4630-ba7b-4d0dda00a90a", "24645e10-6f10-4515-893d-578821cfd20e", "5d7d8304-f78d-4332-aefd-4f4d8d78f0e1", "6874d1bb-039d-4f46-8d27-82cf8c8f891b", "a61b537b-1225-4451-8cb9-715b3da544a2", "cea40fde-586e-49e5-8a65-9b9810948476", "d29b395f-af6e-46ca-a894-60d9bcad0cc0", "d515523f-a419-4f04-aed3-b3d909db139c", "dda7e435-5cbc-4a35-86ab-e934fbf3c7da", "fedbd231-5cf4-44dc-9103-c07c555a79b8"], "title": "Connections with multiple congested gateways in packet-switched networks part 1: one-way traffic", "venue": "acm special interest group on data communication", "year": 1991, "id": "3a4257ae-9cdb-46fb-a5af-70255dfb9d48"}
{"abstract": "We present a novel method, which we refer as an integral histogram, to compute the histograms of all possible target regions in a Cartesian data space. Our method has three distinct advantages: 1) It is computationally superior to the conventional approach. The integral histogram method makes it possible to employ even an exhaustive search process in real-time, which was impractical before. 2) It can be extended to higher data dimensions, uniform and nonuniform bin formations, and multiple target scales without sacrificing its computational advantages. 3) It enables the description of higher level histogram features. We exploit the spatial arrangement of data points, and recursively propagate an aggregated histogram by starting from the origin and traversing through the remaining points along either a scan-line or a wave-front. At each step, we update a single bin using the values of integral histogram at the previously visited neighboring data points. After the integral histogram is propagated, histogram of any target region can be computed easily by using simple arithmetic operations.", "authors": ["Fatih Porikli"], "n_citation": 871, "references": ["43530fe4-10a9-4ddf-b61d-8844f0ff3f04", "58986749-f7f2-4c0c-a0f8-37180df48756", "5be83099-f03c-46fa-9e3d-2eb6302713fa", "8b8a2247-bd77-4736-b493-449734f56b9a", "8e5d1490-accc-40a7-8048-d7efff2304c7", "d4096c82-a4ad-41c8-a3c6-4aa2924dfcbb"], "title": "Integral histogram: a fast way to extract histograms in Cartesian spaces", "venue": "computer vision and pattern recognition", "year": 2005, "id": "b2823eb1-e628-48fd-8bb7-95504a20f054"}
{"abstract": "Abstract   A procedure for filter design is described for enhancing fingerprint images. The procedure consists of five main steps: user-specification of appropriate image features, determination of local ridge orientations throughout the image, smoothing of this orientation image, pixel-by-pixel image enhancement by application of oriented, matched filter masks, and post-processing to reduce background and boundary noise. The contribution of this work is to quantify and justify the functional relationships between image features and filter parameters so that the design process can be easily modified for different conditions of noise and scale. Application of the filter shows good ridge separation and continuity, and background noise reduction.", "authors": ["Lawrence O'Gorman", "Jeffrey V.

{"abstract": "When distributed systems first appeared, they were programmed in traditional sequential languages, usually with the addition of a few library procedures for sending and receiving messages. As distributed applications became more commonplace and more sophisticated, this ad hoc approach became less satisfactory. Researchers all over the world began designing new programming languages specifically for implementing distributed applications. These languages and their history, their underlying principles, their design, and their use are the subject of this paper.  We begin by giving our view of what a distributed system is, illustrating with examples to avoid confusion on this important and controversial point. We then describe the three main characteristics that distinguish distributed programming languages from traditional sequential languages, namely, how they deal with parallelism, communication, and partial failures. Finally, we discuss 15 representative distributed languages to give the flavor of each. These examples include languages based on message passing, rendezvous, remote procedure call, objects, and atomic transactions, as well as functional languages, logic languages, and distributed data structure languages.

{"abstract": "Cooperative multi-agent systems (MAS) are ones in which several agents attempt, through their interaction, to jointly solve tasks or to maximize utility. Due to the interactions among the agents, multi-agent problem complexity can rise rapidly with the number of agents or their behavioral sophistication. The challenge this presents to the task of programming solutions to MAS problems has spawned increasing interest in machine learning techniques to automate the search and optimization process. We provide a broad survey of the cooperative multi-agent learning literature. Previous surveys of this area have largely focused on issues common to specific subareas (for example, reinforcement learning, RL or robotics). In this survey we attempt to draw from multi-agent learning work in a spectrum of areas, including RL, evolutionary computation, game theory, complex systems, agent modeling, and robotics. We find that this broad view leads to a division of the work into two categories, each with its own special issues: applying a single learner to discover joint solutions to multi-agent problems (team learning), or using multiple simultaneous learners, often one per agent (concurrent learning). Additionally, we discuss direct and indirect communication in connection with learning, plus open issues in task decomposition, scalability, and adaptive dynamics. We conclude with a presentation of multi-agent learning problem domains, and a list of multi-agent learning resources.", "authors": ["Liviu Panait", "Sean Luke"], "n_citation": 998, "references":

{"abstract": "Goal-oriented modelling is one of the most important research developments in the RE field. This paper conducts a systematic analysis of the visual syntax of i*, one of the leading goal-oriented languages. Like most RE notations, i* is highly visual. Yet surprisingly, there has been little debate about or modification to its graphical conventions since it was proposed more than a decade ago. We evaluate the notation using a set of evidence-based principles for visual notation design. The paper identifies some serious flaws in the i* visual notation together with some recommendations for improvement. A broader goal of the paper is to raise the level of debate and stimulate discussion about visual representation in RE research.", "authors": ["Daniel L.

{"abstract": "This paper reports on the design and implementation of a real-time executive for a mobile rover that uses a model-based, declarative approach. The control system is based on the intelligent distributed execution architecture (IDEA), an approach to planning and execution that provides a unified representational and computational framework for an autonomous agent. The basic hypothesis of IDEA is that a large control system can be structured as a collection of interacting agents, each with the same fundamental structure. We show that planning and real-time response are compatible if the executive minimizes the size of the planning problem. We detail the implementation of this approach on an 'exploration rover (Gromit, an RWI ATRV Junior at NASA Ames) presenting different IDEA controllers of the same domain and comparing them with more classical approaches.

These approaches split the problem into a sequence of quadratic programming (QP) subproblems which can be solved by efficient gradient projection methods recently proposed. Owing to the ability of decomposing the problem into much larger subproblems than standard decomposition packages, these techniques show promising performance and are well suited for parallelization. Here, we discuss a crucial aspect for their effectiveness: the selection of the working set; that is, the index set of the variables to be optimized at each step through the QP subproblem.

We present a basic scheme for this purpose, which can easily be implemented using any local search algorithm as a subroutine.

Moreover, several extensions are proposed for solving large problem instances: using VNS within the successive approximation method yields a two-level VNS, called variable neighborhood decomposition search (VNDS); modifying the basic scheme to explore easily valleys far from the incumbent solution yields an efficient skewed VNS (SVNS) heuristic.

{"abstract": "We introduce a new combinatorial optimization problem in this article, called the  minimum common integer partition  (MCIP) problem, which was inspired by computational biology applications including ortholog assignment and DNA fingerprint assembly. A  partition  of a positive integer  n  is a multiset of positive integers that add up to exactly  n , and an  integer partition  of a multiset  S  of integers is defined as the multiset union of partitions of integers in  S . Given a sequence of multisets  S  1 ,  S  2 , \u2026,  S k   of integers, where  k  \u2265 2, we say that a multiset is a  common integer partition  if it is an integer partition of every multiset  S i  , 1 \u2264  i  \u2264  k . The MCIP problem is thus defined as to find a common integer partition of  S  1 ,  S  2 , \u2026,  S k   with the minimum cardinality, denoted as MCIP( S  1 ,  S  2 , \u2026,  S k  ).

After that, the areas, the centers, and the axis of the least inertia both of the skin region and the hair region are calculated, which are then used to estimate the 3D pose of the head. We tested our method by estimating the 3D pose of a head from live video sequences.

We extract from the prototype a machine-checkable formal specification in higher-order logic, which may be used to verify properties of the design, and also results in corrections to the design without the need for full verification.

{"abstract": "User support is an important element in reaching the goal of universal usability for Web information systems. Recent developments indicate that human involvement in user support is a step towards this goal. However, most such efforts are currently being pursued on a purely intuitive basis. This, empirical findings about the role of human assistants are important. In this paper we present the findings from a field study of a general user support model for Web information systems. We show that integrating human assistance into Web systems is a way to provide efficient user support. Further, this integration makes a Web site more fun to use and increases the user's trust in the site. The support also improves the site atmosphere.

We propose to use a modular approach, in the sense that we first design a robust nonlinear state feedback which renders the closed loop input to state stable (ISS) between an estimation error of the uncertain parameters and an output tracking error. Next, we complement this robust ISS controller with a model-free extremum seeking (ES) algorithm to estimate the time-varying model uncertainties. The combination of the ISS feedback and the ES algorithm gives an indirect adaptive controller.

Step 1 decomposes an input image, reducing image redundancy. Step 2 excludes non-facial areas using edge information, whereas Step 3 narrows down face areas further using gradient orientation. Step 4 restricts face-like areas by template matching. Finally, Step 5 determines the best face location in the face-like areas and identifies the face based on principal component analysis (PCA).

{"abstract": "An important challenge in designing ubiquitous computing experiences is negotiating transitions between explicit and implicit interaction, such as how and when to provide users with notifications. While the paradigm of implicit interaction has important benefits, it is also susceptible to difficulties with hidden modes, unexpected action, and misunderstood intent. To address these issues, this work presents a framework for  implicit interaction  and applies it to the design of an interactive whiteboard application called Range. Range is a public interactive whiteboard designed to support co-located, ad-hoc meetings. It employs proximity sensing capability to proactively transition between display and authoring modes, to clear space for writing, and to cluster ink strokes. We show how the implicit interaction techniques of  user reflection  (how systems indicate to users what they perceive or infer),  system demonstration  (how systems indicate what they are doing), and  override  (how users can interrupt or stop a proactive system action) can prevent, mitigate, and correct errors in the whiteboard's proactive behaviors. These techniques can be generalized to improve the designs of a wide array of ubiquitous computing experiences.", "authors": ["Wendy Ju", "Brian Lee", "Scott R.

{"abstract": "There are many researches on requirements dependencies. However, most of them limit their views to the requirements phase of software development, few focus on the roles of requirements dependencies in the solution space of software. This paper presents a feature-oriented approach to modeling requirements dependencies. A feature is a set of tight-related requirements from user/customer-views. The feature-orientation provides a modular way to organize requirements and a proper granularity to analyze requirements dependencies. In this approach, we care about not only static feature dependencies (i. e. refinements and constraints), but also feature dependencies at the specification level (namely influences) and, furthermore, dynamic feature dependencies (namely interactions). Moreover, we also explore the underlying connections between these four kinds of feature dependency. By this way, this approach gives a more complete view of how requirements dependencies influence the whole process of software development.", "authors": ["Wei Zhang", "Hong Mei", "Haiyan Zhao"], "n_citation": 98, "references": ["3df22f16-7b64-4bc9-9368-3b6df12d1782", "3e212b43-b4da-4ca9-aed2-fe12777f0631", "4101fefb-7511-4748-b203-3db1f43ec4a9", "4b837f17-7e38-4175-82bc-daa37f162933", "61722ead-e030-4faf-a5f2-154ecfe7b1dc", "73056103-1320-458b-8a6c-7a4ffce54342", "94314988-dff1-4b98-b84e-1e16f0770682", "a0370373-49a0-4c1a-92ff-13b83954ca6e", "c1be242e-ac2a-4679-a9c1-7edd6d8c7606", "cc53b410-e440-43f3-92fe-10cb41f70756", "d0467919-a6c7-4315-93ba-c46510d47469", "e9b849e3-ddaa-4304-a02d-1f079fca2dab", "ec0a10d4-5986-407c-a975-9919f8a84331", "fdc10fc5-728a-4a39-ad0d-ca44f167650c"], "title": "A feature-oriented approach to modeling requirements dependencies", "venue": "Requirements Engineering", "year": 2005, "id": "d2a3ef8e-924c-41e9-b593-2f31e3e5ec49"}

{"abstract": "This paper investigates the problem of vibration control in vehicle active suspension systems, whose aim is to stabilize the attitude of the vehicle and improve ride comfort. In response to uncertainties in systems and the possible actuator saturation, a saturated adaptive robust control (ARC) strategy is proposed. Specifically, an antiwindup block is added to adjust the control strategy in a manner conducive to stability and performance preservation in the presence of saturation. Furthermore, the proposed saturated ARC approach is applied to the half-car active suspension systems, where nonlinear springs and piecewise linear dampers are adopted. Finally, the typical bump road inputs are considered as the road disturbances in order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed control law.", "authors": ["Weichao Sun", "Zhengli Zhao", "Huijun Gao"], "n_citation": 226, "references": ["09b50f5e-939f-4580-bee6-829039ef84d8", "1883668d-dbbc-4da5-a81c-463d55a31c19", "1cd79756-14a4-4c5f-beaf-096a131d247f", "40851a0f-c57f-485f-8381-9239ac23e3e5", "486fa1c9-b09a-4ac5-893b-871acdd346e2", "5aecabeb-c29c-41d1-9173-021765c218fe", "60ef232f-bbae-4728-b908-ac9f143cb87d", "63246fbc-040e-4a6b-81ad-a93bde74b578", "6a5da906-4cd9-4547-8b9d-9a5d3f4a8891", "741556c5-f4dd-4b63-acfe-5062ed31bc03", "7439f79c-2c20-4ada-8442-655baf33f299", "781afaf1-51d5-4855-aa7a-4e11be9e272c", "819e11ad-efad-490d-b070-828a1e59d891", "82ab6448-7cf2-42e2-a71d-57ad9d24d92a", "8d6d9c07-2ecb-48a9-8e24-7e3f2e59cae6", "9c577691-8699-42dd-8a19-22837ee252cb", "a42f7e43-a80d-465d-a7fe-af55dc8c351b", "baf665cc-895c-4dab-834b-1a8cd6e91148", "bddf322e-0869-49ee-aa3a-5832551e3c37", "c591fe2f-4392-44de-9838-0dedcdea2ffe", "fadb7e29-1a33-436b-bac3-df4b055b1a4f"], "title": "Saturated Adaptive Robust Control for Active Suspension Systems", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Industrial Electronics", "year": 2013, "id": "31ce23fe-0327-438e-8193-3080d4441fe0"}
{"abstract": "Bookmark systems are now recognised as a practical mean that allow users to land mark interesting sites in the huge information space that constitute the World Wide Web. In this paper we argue that, by building collaborative bookmark management tools where a group of people can share their experiences and their results in feeding and organising personal bookmark sets, bookmarks can be transformed into effective customized web spaces. In this paper we first present a study of main requirements that a shared bookmark system should meet. Then the design space of such applications is analysed. The set of identified requirements is used to compare and criticise main collaborative shared bookmark systems that are proposed in the literature. Main drawbacks of existing systems are a) the weak customisation of shared spaces, b) the lack of efficient and easy to use privacy protection policies, and c) the adoption of centralised architectures that affects badly responsiveness, availability and dependability of these systems. Based on our analysis of the state of the art we propose a full distributed collaborative bookmark management system, called CoWing, that meets most of the requirements identified in this paper. A special attention is paid to protect the privacy of the system users.", "authors": ["Rushed Kanawati", "Maria Malek"], "n_citation": 12, "references": ["7a41e483-5f5a-42a5-9f35-f8db5a701527", "809ef8d4-dde8-4c74-b338-087ddc6a91b5", "9918782e-182b-47a4-a989-a364cd3576d1", "9a414a62-aea1-47bb-9c96-dda5801cfdc7", "9ae0142d-b12f-42b1-ac48-d655fdec233f", "faa8a1f2-d51d-42be-b0e7-50efc867a15a"], "title": "Informing the design of shared bookmark systems", "venue": "", "year": 2000, "id": "4c6be4e5-826b-46d0-80c1-a548616d1f2e"}

{"abstract": "Separation logic is a program logic for reasoning about programs that manipulate pointer data structures. We describe Smallfoot, a tool for checking certain lightweight separation logic specifications. The assertions describe the shapes of data structures rather than their detailed contents, and this allows reasoning to be fully automatic. The presentation in the paper is tutorial in style. We illustrate what the tool can do via examples which are oriented toward novel aspects of separation logic, namely: avoidance of frame axioms (which say what a procedure does not change); embracement of \u201cdirty\u201d features such as memory disposal and address arithmetic; information hiding in the presence of pointers; and modular reasoning about concurrent programs.", "authors": ["Josh Berdine", "Cristiano Calcagno", "Peter W.

{"abstract": "Abstract : The problem of unification of terms is log-space complete for P. in deriving this lower bound no use is made of the potentially concise representation of terms by directed acyclic graphs. In addition, the problem remains complete even if infinite substitutions are allowed. A consequence of this result is that parallelism cannot significantly improve on the best sequential solutions for unification. The dual problem of computing the congruence closure of an equivalence relation is also log-space complete for P. However, it is shown that for the problem of term matching, an important subcase of unification, there is a good parallel algorithm using O(log 2 n) time and nO(1) processors on a PRAM. For the O(log2 n) parallel time upper bound it is assumed that the terms are represented by directed acyclic graphs; if the longer string representation is used an O(log n) parallel time bound is obtained.

{"abstract": "In software maintenance and evolution, it is common that developers want to apply a change to a number of similar places. Due to the size and complexity of the code base, it is challenging for developers to locate all the places that need the change. A main challenge in locating the places that need the change is that, these places share certain common dependence conditions but existing code searching techniques can hardly handle dependence relations satisfactorily. In this paper, we propose a technique that enables developers to make queries involving dependence conditions and textual conditions on the system dependence graph of the program. We carried out an empirical evaluation on four searching tasks taken from the development history of two real-world projects. The results of our evaluation indicate that, compared with code-clone detection, our technique is able to locate many required code elements that code-clone detection cannot locate, and compared with text search, our technique is able to effectively reduce false positives without losing any required code elements.", "authors": ["Xiaoyin Wang", "David Lo", "Jiefeng Cheng", "Lu Zhang", "Hong Mei", "Jeffrey Xu Yu"], "n_citation": 39, "references": ["092efa15-5c8b-4d3e-ba66-47e69c8371c3", "239ca407-8b9d-43c5-90bc-4602b549506e", "2c08d317-3848-40af-9dfa-20c8ce584ce9", "2c50b53f-40f3-400c-a273-2a82d59960ad", "2c850a6b-215d-4eaf-9dc2-d2e8e7e06766", "36769362-d5cc-438a-abf4-87912cc12166", "4b86723c-d5f8-41fa-93f5-08a9ef730e33", "63044248-3a3a-4c1b-9549-7f55e5920978", "6ec51ecc-8a9f-4c98-8db9-03f21d344455", "78979e63-72c1-41a2-b1bc-3a1300bf05ec", "819da3e8-bebd-4a36-8991-b51fb011ae43", "9011a9b2-7e79-43c5-9e63-be634e4fd9e2", "97de2098-19b9-4343-9cf0-0e18a70f85c0", "b38f968e-579d-4f18-b442-43cf85a72321", "b44ecd54-fef9-43b9-b56a-d9101d053471", "b9ebb475-e62b-4262-9fbf-a7e51a81d684", "bf86852a-d314-4c47-808a-3a49fe8f4bef", "c2bd41a8-c67a-4cd6-a893-035fd03278ed", "d1925fd6-cae1-4335-81df-635aa907a4ad", "f829dffc-3599-4527-8474-51343e55aef3"], "title": "Matching dependence-related queries in the system dependence graph", "venue": "automated software engineering", "year": 2010, "id": "98f6d19d-fdf0-48e3-b600-05fbc3023ea3"}
{"abstract": "To make efficient use of a dynamic system such as a mechanical manipulator, the robotic controller needs various models of its behaviour. I describe a method of learning in which all the experiences in the lifetime of the robot are explicitly remembered. They are stored in a manner which permits fast recall of the closest previous experience to any new situation. This leads to a very high rate of learning of the robot kinematics and dynamics which conventionally need to be derived analytically. The representation is a modified binary multidimensional tree called a  sab-tree  which stores state-action-behaviour triples. This permits fast prediction of the effects of proposed actions and, given a goal behaviour, permits fast generation of a candidate action. I also discuss how the system is made resistant to noisy inputs and adapts to environmental changes. I explain how appropriate actions can be selected in the cases where (i) there has been earlier success and (ii) experimentation is required. This can be used to transform dynamic control to a greatly simplified problem. I conclude with some simulated experiments which exhibit high rates of learning. The final experiment also illustrates how a compound learning task can be structured into a hierarchy of simple learning tasks.", "authors": ["Andrew W.

{"abstract": "Wearable computers afford a degree of mobility that makes tracking for augmented reality difficult. This paper presents a novel object-centric tracking architecture for presenting augmented reality media in spatial relationships to objects, regardless of the objects' positions or motions in the world. The advance this system provides is the ability to sense and integrate new features into its tracking database, thereby extending the tracking region automatically. A \u201clazy evaluation\u201d of the structure from motion problem uses images obtained from a single calibrated moving camera and applies recursive filtering to identify and estimate the 3D positions of new features.

A coupled oscillator network is characterized by a population of heterogeneous oscillators and a graph describing the interaction among the oscillators.

In this article, we present a tutorial introduction to coupled oscillator networks, we review the vast literature on theory and applications, and we present a collection of different synchronization notions, conditions, and analysis approaches. We focus on the canonical phase oscillator models occurring in countless real-world synchronization phenomena, and present their rich phenomenology. We review a set of applications relevant to control scientists.

{"abstract": "Sharing knowledge pertaining to software architectures becomes increasingly important. If this knowledge is not explicitly stored or communicated, valuable knowledge dissipates. However, stakeholders will only share knowledge with each other if they are motivated to do so, or in other words if the necessary incentives are created. In this paper we identify three incentives for architectural knowledge sharing: the establishment of social ties, more efficient decision making, and knowledge internalization.

{"abstract": "A method for creating a constrained clustering ensemble by learning the priorities of pair wise constraints is proposed in this paper. This method integrates multiple clusters produced by using a simple constrained K-means algorithm that we modify to utilize the constraints priorities. The cluster ensemble is executed according to a boosting framework, which adaptively learns the constraints priorities and provides them for the modified constrained K-means to create diverse clusters that finally improve the clustering performance. The experimental results show that our proposed method outperforms the original constrained K-means and is comparable to several state-of-the-art constrained clustering methods.", "authors": ["Masayuki Okabe", "Seiji Yamada"], "n_citation": 6, "references": ["06dc0648-62ce-4357-8fb5-9d0dbd83faed", "07ab3e60-5ab5-4c78-9736-ea57aba5d1a7", "22ebb916-bab4-45ea-80b5-42bea948a7bf", "284f32d0-8650-40a4-8208-5afc143d930c", "310cbba4-d88d-4bf4-a4f2-738f91b5f8c8", "807b8ea8-a82a-46ae-87d4-387ea795fa7a", "b5b70a9b-0312-4ad8-add8-1fd3cd3c7198", "c6621147-c57a-4817-99d2-4e14b57150ca", "d823f0e4-e853-45e8-99bc-404ef132bd4d", "db26488d-78be-44b1-a343-e896f43c5d29", "e20175e3-16b9-4975-9480-682a1ade8588"], "title": "Clustering by Learning Constraints Priorities", "venue": "international conference on data mining", "year": 2012, "id": "230f4789-068f-474c-beaf-fe63729af133"}
{"abstract": "Although the presence of a schema enables many optimizations for operations on XML documents, recent studies have shown that many XML documents in practice either do not refer to a schema, or refer to a syntactically incorrect one. It is therefore of utmost importance to provide tools and techniques that can automatically generate schemas from sets of sample documents. While previous work in this area has mostly focused on the inference of Document Type Definitions (DTDs for short), we will consider the inference of XML Schema Definitions (XSDs for short) --- the increasingly popular schema formalism that is turning DTDs obsolete. In contrast to DTDs where the content model of an element depends only on the element's name, the content model in an XSD can also depend on the context in which the element is used. Hence, while the inference of DTDs basically reduces to the inference of regular expressions from sets of sample strings, the inference of XSDs also entails identifying from a corpus of sample documents the contexts in which elements bear different content models. Since a seminal result by Gold implies that no inference algorithm can learn the complete class of XSDs from positive examples only, we focus on a class of XSDs that captures most XSDs occurring in practice. For this class, we provide a theoretically complete algorithm that always infers the correct XSD when a sufficiently large corpus of XML documents is available. In addition, we present a variant of this algorithm that works well on real-world (and therefore incomplete) data sets.", "authors": ["Geert Jan Bex", "Frank Neven", "Stijn Vansummeren"], "n_citation": 119, "references": ["05121ab8-d997-4cce-a3d6-037a37831f5e", "21e7bee4-c92d-4045-ae54-94aa900baefa", "288e5d5f-81e9-4840-8acf-a07f72c5c084", "29781bdd-2b53-428c-a7bb-60b2f1805ea1", "2a977d9b-c58c-4bf1-84d1-91c1d2d32291", "3d93acb5-a995-4085-841f-c23f72143624", "3de95199-e946-464c-87a2-4c2e1393ea02", "4960b87e-8fe0-4871-af82-a265af82607e", "4b4ed016-c54a-411e-93c2-3852880e55ac", "528201c5-eeee-4832-8f8c-9bb2f697fb32", "57ffaea2-7fcc-4245-b9a9-59cfc77ee358", "61ee758a-0d58-4a7e-afad-6d3f5f438910", "64e399f1-a83d-41e1-af8f-f9c74f6476c2", "6edb1438-3585-42da-b220-9ff15fc6a5da", "72445d81-7db9-4909-b8fb-a7e9374b663a", "75d5d40c-3cff-476d-8e9d-3a6f420f8546", "7ad7d4ec-f767-44c8-a196-1ce2cc87479f", "80f51ca0-68e2-4bd9-ae69-fdc8c834525d", "815fad3f-ee6f-4c73-8487-79f8b3c1269c", "83bd5746-b20f-4b66-8429-6122a82ae14f", "8c228458-f497-496d-8422-e1e6adf94e84", "8c823c45-b68f-40d2-b781-158a2c2cd70d", "91880b49-a023-4e01-867d-f598368ccd84", "9836638a-2184-4d1b-adf1-ae00de918aab", "99f8af24-dd70-4a9e-a208-377a83464505", "acebd1e3-6494-4a00-8272-595081e49c33", "b1b15798-b23a-4835-aa52-6af09e96fbfd", "b5976060-065d-4721-9daf-d0da7a8903c8", "b67456d7-0229-4374-8e0b-c8f153b891a3", "bd60a05c-e854-497d-ae79-d9f64530c884", "c48403c2-1887-4e34-9ba5-92027f4d1a7d", "de4e0e08-2c42-4dc0-8e89-523f688770c8", "eb9f312a-2c14-4311-ac45-aec0b4ebc00b", "f512b080-924b-466f-9c7e-96a19f6bce7a", "f56ac912-6d18-4a63-9582-3438a938fb33"], "title": "Inferring XML schema definitions from XML data", "venue": "very large data bases", "year": 2007, "id": "5c3c549e-ed36-4d1f-8344-95f5920b1a8b"}

{"abstract": "Watermarking with oblivious detection and high robustness capabilities together is still a challenging problem. In addition, the number of secret keys which is required in the detection process should be kept as minimal as possible. Usually, a human visual model-based watermarking method requires recording the hiding places where watermarks are concealed. However, this kind of embedding strategy will cause an extra burden during watermark detection. The objective of this paper is to propose a more general watermarking framework which can satisfy the requirements of robustness and oblivious detection while only requiring one secret key in both the embedding and the detection processes. The paper proposes to employ the side information concept which is commonly used in communication together with a mean filtering process to design a new watermarking technology.

{"abstract": "Users frequently formulate complex data analysis queries in order to identify interesting trends, make unusual patterns stand out, or verify hypotheses. Being able to express these data mining queries concisely is of major importance not only from the user's, but also from the system's point of view. Recent research in OLAP has focused on datacubes and their applications; however expression and processing of ad hoc decision support queries has been given very little attention. We present an appropriate framework for these queries and introduce a syntactic construct to support it. This SQL extension allows most OLAP queries, such as pivoting, complex intra- and inter-group comparisons, trends and hierarchical comparisons, to be expressed in a compact, intuitive and simple manner. This succinct representation of a complex OLAP query translates immediately to a novel, simple and efficient evaluation algorithm. We show how to optimize, analyze and parallelize this algorithm and discuss issues such as multiple query analysis and scaling. We present several experimental results of real life queries that show orders of magnitude of performance improvement. We argue that this tight coupling between representation and algorithm is essential to efficient processing of ad hoc OLAP queries.", "authors": ["Damianos Chatziantoniou"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["07416413-8701-4feb-a883-5268ff9e90a5"], "title": "Ad hoc OLAP: expression and evaluation", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 1999, "id": "0c03f447-70f4-4cfe-af5b-051ccfe7e73c"}
{"abstract": "Various static analysis tools will analyze a software artifact in order to identify potential defects, such as misused APIs, race conditions and deadlocks, and security vulnerabilities. For a number of reasons, it is important to be able to track the occurrence of each potential defect over multiple versions of a software artifact understudy: in other words, to determine when warnings reported in multiple versions of the software all correspond the same underlying issue. One motivation for this capability is to remember decisions about code that has been reviewed and found to be safe despite the occurrence of a warning. Another motivation is constructing warning deltas between versions, showing which warnings are new, which have persisted,and which have disappeared. This allows reviewers to focus their efforts on inspecting new warnings. Finally, tracking warnings through a series of software versions reveals where potential defects are introduced and fixed, and how long they persist, exposing interesting trends and patterns.We will discuss two different techniques we have implemented in FindBugs (a static analysis tool to find bugs in Java programs) for tracking defects across versions, discuss their relative merits and how they can be incorporated into the software development process, and discuss the results of tracking defect warnings across Sun's Java runtime library.", "authors": ["Jaime Spacco", "David Hovemeyer", "William Pugh"], "n_citation": 32, "references": ["2c850a6b-215d-4eaf-9dc2-d2e8e7e06766"], "title": "Tracking defect warnings across versions", "venue": "mining software repositories", "year": 2006, "id": "ae5f220e-d766-4c05-8893-9ff7da4c5fca"}

{"abstract": "A design-based method to fuse Gabor filter and grey level co-occurrence probability (GLCP) features for improved texture recognition is presented. The fused feature set utilizes both the Gabor filter's capability of accurately capturing lower and mid-frequency texture information and the GLCP's capability in texture information relevant to higher frequency components. Evaluation methods include comparing feature space separability and comparing image segmentation classification rates. The fused feature sets are demonstrated to produce higher feature space separations, as well as higher segmentation accuracies relative to the individual feature sets. Fused feature sets also outperform individual feature sets for noisy images, across different noise magnitudes. The curse of dimensionality is demonstrated not to affect segmentation using the proposed the 48-dimensional fused feature set. Gabor magnitude responses produce higher segmentation accuracies than linearly normalized Gabor magnitude responses. Feature reduction using principal component analysis is acceptable for maintaining the segmentation performance, but feature reduction using the feature contrast method dramatically reduced the segmentation accuracy. Overall, the designed fused feature set is advocated as a means for improving texture segmentation performance.", "authors": ["David A.

{"abstract": "In this paper we describe a language for reasoning about actions that can be used for modelling and for programming rational agents. We propose a modal approach for reasoning about dynamic domains in a logic programming setting. Agent behavior is specified by means of complex actions which are defined using modal inclusion axioms. The language is able to handle knowledge producing actions as well as actions which remove information. The problem of reasoning about complex actions with incomplete knowledge is tackled and the temporal projection and planning problems is addressed; more specifically, a goal directed proof procedure is defined, which allows agents to reason about complex actions and to generate conditional plans.

{"abstract": "By utilizing some of the important properties of wavelets like denoising, compression, multiresolution along with the concepts of fuzzy logic and neural network, a new self-constructing fuzzy wavelet neural networks (SCFWNN) using compensatory fuzzy operators are proposed for intelligent fault diagnosis. An on-line learning algorithm is applied to automatically construct the SCFWNN. There are no rules initially in the SCFWNN. They are created and adapted as on-line learning proceeds via simultaneous structure and parameter learning. The advantages of this learning algorithm are that it converges quickly and the obtained fuzzy rules are more precise. The proposed SCFWNN is much more powerful than either the neural network or the fuzzy system since it can incorporate the advantages of both. The results of simulation show that this SCFWNN method has the advantage of faster learning rate and higher diagnosing precision.", "authors": ["Haibin Yu", "Qianjin Guo", "Aidong Xu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["09556d05-aec0-40d2-83f1-16df6e504039", "3f0bc2c9-a5c2-4e4c-a4e9-7631e36bc6a3", "483e3286-5cef-4215-8da1-29234c4dd214", "4d6c58da-7748-413b-aa45-09b1ca528c1a", "6bfa8795-f0d8-4f20-afe9-ad842c2fa6fc", "6eebf001-6f96-46f1-9723-19c05e8fa351", "7ccbdf09-a84e-4ad2-ab20-cb28b6c41155", "c6e12d8c-aab3-4d30-b2c3-bbf0475ae391", "ea10ae08-14d6-4b0d-afaf-9e2e28eb79f7", "ebe8da88-e207-4c86-828e-532e0aa778a4", "f17b15cd-13da-445d-827b-ccf0fa40f707", "f84a7ec7-289f-4f28-be95-dcc4ad049627"], "title": "A self-constructing compensatory fuzzy wavelet network and its applications", "venue": "fuzzy systems and knowledge discovery", "year": 2005, "id": "dc3fa5d3-a3a2-4bef-b2b3-83946cec7abf"}

{"abstract": "A Hebbian adaptation rule with winner-take-all like competition is introduced. It is shown that this competitive Hebbian rule forms so-called Delaunay triangulations, which play an important role in computational geometry for efficiently solving proximity problems. Given a set of neural units i, i = 1,\u2026, N, the synaptic weights of which can be interpreted as pointers  w  i , i = 1,\u2026, N in R D , the competitive Hebbian rule leads to a connectivity structure between the units i that corresponds to the Delaunay triangulation of the set of pointers  w  i . Such competitive Hebbian rule develops connections (C ij  > 0) between neural units i, j with neighboring receptive fields (Voronoi polygons) V i , V j , whereas between all other units i, j no connections evolve (C ij  = 0). Combined with a procedure that distributes the pointers  w  i  over a given feature manifold M, for example, a submanifold M \u2282  R   D  , the competitive Hebbian rule provides a novel approach to the problem of constructing topology preserving feature maps and representing intricately structured manifolds. The competitive Hebbian rule connects only neural units, the receptive fields (Voronoi polygons) V i , V j  of which are adjacent on the given manifold M. This leads to a connectivity structure that defines a perfectly topology preserving map and forms a discrete, path preserving representation of M, also in cases where M has an intricate topology. This makes this novel approach particularly useful in all applications where neighborhood relations have to be exploited or the shape and topology of submanifolds have to be take into account.", "authors": ["Thomas Martinetz", "Klaus Schulten"], "n_citation": 998, "references": ["06ceb3b9-1a76-48b8-af20-008287b709a6", "0b260dc1-88a1-4cbf-8116-2e7eeb9d3ed1", "126446a1-730e-44dc-858b-e5c768bd81ac", "3960e422-fe4c-4ae5-b3e6-a828783e72e7", "510eec1d-f82c-4b19-b116-b8fd4c66531a", "6d166f57-4ad1-48f0-8d83-28978eee7c09", "a1957b43-5855-4649-8e9b-722246a4ee62", "ea03b25e-a14c-476f-9473-8b07f18e9343", "ec0c146d-ff15-4f73-8ea1-55268340ab42"], "title": "Topology representing networks", "venue": "Neural Networks", "year": 1994, "id": "a388da07-1608-4b15-aa08-a6cbb53be603"}

However, the management of massive, distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic Grid services is becoming increasingly complex. This paper proposes a model of agent-enabling autonomic Grid service system to relieve the management burdens such as configuration, deployment, discovery, composition, and monitoring of Grid services. We adopt intelligent agents as autonomic elements to manage Grid services from two aspects: internal management and external transaction and cooperation. On the one hand, within an autonomic element (agent), goal-based planning and scheduling mechanism autonomously (re-) configures, and monitors the enforcement of, managed elements (Grid services or other agents).

This description is obtained from an investigation of the deep structure of a scale space image-the input image and the Gaussian filtered ones simultaneously. We concentrate on scale space critical points-points with vanishing gradient with respect to both spatial and scale direction. We show that these points are always saddle points. They turn out to be extremely useful, since the iso-intensity manifolds through these points provide a scale space hierarchy tree and induce a segmentation without a priori knowledge. Moreover, together with the so-called catastrophe points, these scale space saddles form the critical points of the parameterised critical curves-the curves along which the spatial saddle points move in scale space.

{"abstract": "Detecting behavioral anomalies in human daily life is important to developing smart assisted-living systems for elderly care. Based on data collected from wearable motion sensors and the associated locational context, this paper presents a coherent anomaly detection framework to effectively detect different behavioral anomalies in human daily life. Four types of anomalies, including spatial anomaly, timing anomaly, duration anomaly, and sequence anomaly, are detected using a probabilistic theoretical framework. This framework is based on complex activity recognition using dynamic Bayesian network modeling. The maximum-likelihood estimation algorithm and Laplace smoothing are used in learning the parameters in the anomaly detection model. We conducted experimental evaluation in a mock apartment environment, and the results verified the effectiveness of the proposed framework. We expect that this behavioral anomaly detection system can be integrated into future smart homes for elderly care.", "authors": ["Chun Zhu", "Weihua Sheng", "Meiqin Liu"], "n_citation": 5, "references": ["0bfeffa5-d74b-4bd3-b963-05a3fad338bf", "0ccebbfd-5c6a-41cd-b3e5-415896a63e1a", "16d7bf83-9ea7-44de-a6a8-399cb1cde02e", "2c0404ca-4014-42ba-9030-b69dcfa0541b", "3409ea24-162d-4468-a6c4-47e5318225bc", "455a1419-c111-46f3-a332-1420ef2b7244", "5a4a1b04-b36f-402c-a87f-0779098ef050", "68611edb-fdda-4d1f-98f9-de236cc4a8ec", "68b8ab9d-cb5a-4435-9208-e2a64c9ae08b", "6f0a120f-58de-4ccb-b105-8a694073e75f", "7c6a970a-0d6f-4e4b-b50e-6c6fbd23a9ab", "97baf1e8-b567-466e-8aa3-d12201f84b31", "a896a5fd-65d4-407d-9846-07cb712b370b", "af7d9876-0d7a-449a-8cab-c1f7bb792be6", "d4ff9421-5bef-484e-8f60-6cce006904ff", "ff00a2e7-4722-48f2-9442-b12f5b7fb165"], "title": "Wearable Sensor-Based Behavioral Anomaly Detection in Smart Assisted Living Systems", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Automation Science and Engineering", "year": 2015, "id": "eaef59bf-d2b9-4625-a63b-ccc5bb1bafd1"}

{"abstract": "Abstract   We introduce a methodology to treat abstract data types (ADT), abstract parametric classes (APC) and subclasses, together with appropriate inheritance properties, by means of first order theories. The notion of a first order theory axiomatizing an ADT is based on the notion of isoinitial model and has been proposed by the authors in previous papers (Bertoni  et al.  (1979), Bertoni  et al.  (1983), Bertoni  et al.  (1984)). A theory formalizing an APC is seen, in this paper, as a theory  T  incompletely axiomatizing an ADT. Given a class  C  of ADT's, the class formalized by  T  can be seen (under suitable soundness conditions on  T ) as the class of the instances of  T  over  C . An instantiation of  T  by an ADT  I  of  C  completes  T  into a  T \u2032 formalizing an ADT I\u2032, which extends  I  and inherits the properties of the APC  T .  We use both classical and constructive methods in the following sense: on the one hand, the semantics is based on classical model theory; on the other hand, the soundness of a consistent axiomatization can be analyzed by purely syntactical methods, in terms of provability within suitable constructive systems.  A theory  T  formalizing an APC (or an ADT) is not given by a list of axioms, but by a suitable \"APC-expression\", which explicitly or implicitly (but  effectively  ) defines the axioms of  T . We have APC-expressions to define APC's, to extend already defined APC's and to instantiate APC's (into ADT's or subclasses). We allow also \"recurrence APC-expressions\". At the end of the paper we give some examples showing how the proposed methodology works.", "authors": ["Pierangelo Miglioli", "Ugo Moscato", "Mario Ornaghi"], "n_citation": 28, "title": "Abstract parametric classes and abstract data types defined by classical and constructive logical methods", "venue": "Journal of Symbolic Computation", "year": 1994, "id": "cf91baa5-a81b-44ba-baab-77d6e8b91116"}
{"abstract": "Field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) are large, fast integrated circuits-that can be modified, or configured, almost at any point by the end user.

This paper describes four applications in the domain of configurable computing, considering both static and dynamic systems, including: SPYDER (a reconfigurable processor development system), RENCO (a reconfigurable network computer), Firefly (an evolving machine), and the BioWatch (a self-repairing watch).

{"abstract": "We present an algorithm that derives actions' effects and preconditions in partially observable, relational domains. Our algorithm has two unique features: an expressive relational language, and an exact tractable computation. An action-schema language that we present permits learning of preconditions and effects that include implicit objects and unstated relationships between objects. For example, we can learn that replacing a blown fuse turns on all the lights whose switch is set to on. The algorithm maintains and outputs a relational-logical representation of all possible action-schema models after a sequence of executed actions and partial observations. Importantly, our algorithm takes polynomial time in the number of time steps and predicates. Time dependence on other domain parameters varies with the action-schema language. Our experiments show that the relational structure speeds up both learning and generalization, and outperforms propositional learning methods. It also allows establishing apriori-unknown connections between objects (e.g. light bulbs and their switches), and permits learning conditional effects in realistic and complex situations. Our algorithm takes advantage of a DAG structure that can be updated efficiently and preserves compactness of representation.", "authors": ["Dafna Shahaf", "Eyal Amir"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1106c253-88ce-433b-8293-37b3e53fbf7d", "1dc1347b-4efe-499f-b743-4b35573cf934", "43959b1e-98f1-45c5-a7eb-cfeb9ce364d9", "4ce47a58-a2da-4258-bda5-c5d6607adbd7", "57acf6e2-4d04-4b1c-b5c4-5efe32c179f0", "57c15698-916e-42d2-a176-3679f64d6061", "6619abc7-aea3-4448-a4a2-73934582925a", "905491c2-6955-43a5-bd5f-7b059954f7a6", "d72b168f-3163-4314-a48e-5d6471840519", "e0f3a738-4ab2-40d1-ba44-506d81c1d230", "ea4407ed-5fde-4a4e-962a-06f6af1ebc29"], "title": "Learning partially observable action schemas", "venue": "national conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2006, "id": "67ea1233-e81a-430d-9f0b-5c948e4fcd70"}

{"abstract": "In this paper the modeling, monitoring, and control of electric power systems are presented from the point of view of large-scale dynamic systems. First a summary of current hierarchical operations is given, together with an assessment of the underlying assumptions. Next, the challenge of operating electric power systems over very broad ranges of system conditions is presented as an open sensing, estimation, and control problem. The latter part of this paper is motivated by fundamental technological and organizational changes. These are requiring a shift from hierarchical to multilayered open access modeling, monitoring, and control paradigms for large complex electric power systems. A vision of a novel information-based multilayered dynamic energy control protocols (DECPs) framework for facilitating evolution into open access just-in-time (JIT) and just-in-place (JIP) electricity services of the future is presented.", "authors": ["Marija D.

{"abstract": "There has been a significant amount of excitement and recent work on column-oriented database systems (\"column-stores\"). These database systems have been shown to perform more than an order of magnitude better than traditional row-oriented database systems (\"row-stores\") on analytical workloads such as those found in data warehouses, decision support, and business intelligence applications. The elevator pitch behind this performance difference is straightforward: column-stores are more I/O efficient for read-only queries since they only have to read from disk (or from memory) those attributes accessed by a query.   This simplistic view leads to the assumption that one can obtain the performance benefits of a column-store using a row-store: either by vertically partitioning the schema, or by indexing every column so that columns can be accessed independently. In this paper, we demonstrate that this assumption is false. We compare the performance of a commercial row-store under a variety of different configurations with a column-store and show that the row-store performance is significantly slower on a recently proposed data warehouse benchmark. We then analyze the performance difference and show that there are some important differences between the two systems at the query executor level (in addition to the obvious differences at the storage layer level). Using the column-store, we then tease apart these differences, demonstrating the impact on performance of a variety of column-oriented query execution techniques, including vectorized query processing, compression, and a new join algorithm we introduce in this paper. We conclude that while it is not impossible for a row-store to achieve some of the performance advantages of a column-store, changes must be made to both the storage layer and the query executor to fully obtain the benefits of a column-oriented approach.", "authors": ["Daniel J.

{"abstract": "A comprehensive metrics validation methodology is proposed that has six validity criteria, which support the quality functions assessment, control, and prediction, where quality functions are activities conducted by software organizations for the purpose of achieving project quality goals. Six criteria are defined and illustrated: association, consistency, discriminative power, tracking, predictability, and repeatability. The author shows that nonparametric statistical methods such as contingency tables play an important role in evaluating metrics against the validity criteria. Examples emphasizing the discriminative power validity criterion are presented. A metrics validation process is defined that integrates quality factors, metrics, and quality functions. >", "authors": ["Norman F.

Dynamic reverse engineering techniques are especially important for understanding the run-time behavior of objects in a distributed object systems and in systems that rely heavily on polymorphism.

The dynamic event trace information is generated automatically as a result of running the target system under a customized sdk debugger and viewed as scenario diagrams using the SCED tool (K. Koskimies et al., 1998). In SCED, state diagrams can be synthesized automatically from scenario diagrams. This facility is used to visualize the total behavior of a selected object or method, disconnected from the rest of the system.

It demonstrates that advanced graphics techniques can enhance routine office information tasks. The Time Lattice is formed by aligning a collection of 2D calendars. 2D translucent shadows provide views and interactive access to the resulting complex 3D object.

A critical success factor in such a scenario is to have a collaborative platform for managing and sharing the domain specific knowledge across distributed locations. In our ongoing research we have developed a human assisted collaborative knowledge sharing tool called CollabDev. The aim of this tool is to analyze applications in multiple languages and render various structural, architectural, and functional insights to the people involved in maintenance. The novelty of this platform lies in integrating different elements of application knowledge by linking them to source code and allowing multiple developers to collaborate on-line by using annotations for the knowledge elements. The platform also provides diagnostic information on architecture of source code.", "authors": ["Santonu Sarkar", "Renuka Sindhgatta", "Krishnakumar Pooloth"], "n_citation": 23, "references": ["1ef9cc2b-fd41-4e89-b594-58b5478d1cf8", "3f0e1038-36b2-469a-940c-a137b10e918b", "4b675930-a921-42e9-91c2-d4c669d9de69", "5d5f94da-9306-4a46-96eb-f174bab1f9b8", "651d58f3-5b85-41db-8b6c-cb7084ac0315", "800e1ad2-8944-4b7d-9eeb-62e24313ba07", "8eaa9d14-71ff-4cf1-8038-abd9b62f4c6e", "97e50bd4-0fda-4d8e-84d2-3b282643b9e4", "b866a8a8-4b7d-4737-a4c5-edf995d9fbf0", "eee7d8be-a846-4b98-bf38-55909f650069", "f12fe97d-a702-4988-8f79-a7b011a5bbba"], "title": "A collaborative platform for application knowledge management in software maintenance projects", "venue": "bangalore annual compute conference", "year": 2008, "id": "b9497c85-9432-4142-8aad-1c095d59088d"}
{"abstract": "This paper deals with evaluation of the dependability (considered as a generic term, whose main measures are reliability, availability, and maintainability) of software systems during their operational life, in contrast to most of the work performed up to now, devoted mainly to development and validation phases. The failure process due to design faults, and the behavior of a software system up to the first failure and during its life cycle are successively examined. An approximate model is derived which enables one to account for the failures due to the design faults in a simple way when evaluating a system's dependability. This model is then used for evaluating the dependability of 1) a software system tolerating design faults, and 2) a computing system with respect to physical and design faults.", "authors": ["Jean-Claude Laprie"], "n_citation": 153, "references": ["02e0342a-33d3-4d3f-9f1d-b14081edbc39", "04ebdff8-1493-4a40-b8ba-1c83d5d64275", "07b06816-514c-4976-a5e8-f1277031f5e9", "19416ed3-7d70-4619-940f-9d673d009d73", "65aaabdf-5b3c-4fca-a991-157e984a34db", "7697d41b-d4c1-4675-9b0b-f469619b8af7", "7d858c10-2f60-4a71-b51c-be58827083d8", "8fa8c252-047b-4930-9758-fff34825859e", "b44d6593-c2c9-42ed-af1a-13f6dc7469ff"], "title": "Dependability Evaluation of Software Systems in Operation", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering", "year": 1984, "id": "60e9df30-6d32-4372-9e3c-360f2773ce3e"}

The objective is to capture the essential features of a crowdsourcing system, an environment in which diverse tasks are presented to a large community. We aim to demonstrate the precise relationship between incentives and participation in such systems.   We model contests as all-pay auctions with incomplete information; as a consequence of revenue equivalence, our model may also be interpreted more broadly as one in which users select among auctions of heterogeneous goods. We present two regimes in which we find an explicit correspondence in equilibrium between the offered rewards and the users' participation levels. The regimes respectively model situations in which different contests require similar or unrelated skills. Principally, we find that rewards yield logarithmically diminishing returns with respect to participation levels.

{"abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of tracking a subset of a domain (called the target) which changes gradually over time. A single (unknown) probability distribution over the domain is used to generate random examples for the learning algorithm and measure the speed at which the target changes. Clearly, the more rapidly the target moves, the harder it is for the algorithm to maintain a good approximation of the target. Therefore we evaluate algorithms based on how much movement of the target can be tolerated between examples while predicting with accuracy e Furthermore, the complexity of the class {\\CAL H} of possible targets, as measured by d, its VC-dimension, also effects the difficulty of tracking the target concept. We show that if the problem of minimizing the number of disagreements with a sample from among concepts in a class {\\CAL H} can be approximated to within a factor k, then there is a simple tracking algorithm for {\\CAL H} which can achieve a probability e of making a mistake if the target movement rate is at most a constant times epsilon^2/(k(d+k){\\rm ln}{1\\over \\epsilon}), where d is the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of {\\CAL H}. Also, we show that if {\\CAL H} is properly PAC-learnable, then there is an efficient (randomized) algorithm that with high probability approximately minimizes disagreements to within a factor of 7d + 1, yielding an efficient tracking algorithm for {\\CAL H} which tolerates drift rates up to a constant times \\epsilon^2/(d^2{\\rm ln}{1\\over \\epsilon}). In addition, we prove complementary results for the classes of halfspaces and axis-aligned hyperrectangles showing that the maximum rate of drift that any algorithm (even with unlimited computational power) can tolerate is a constant times e2/d.", "authors": ["David P.

{"abstract": "Abstract   The by-now-standard perspective on databases within the deductive database community is that they can be specified by sets of first-order sentences. As such, they can be said to be claims about the truths of some  external  world; the database is a representation of that world.  Within the logical database paradigm, virtually all approaches to database query evaluation treat queries as first-order formulas, usually with free variables whose bindings resulting from the evaluation phase define the answers to the query. Following Levesque [10, 11], we argue that, for greater expressiveness, queries should be formulas in an epistemic modal logic. Queries, in other words, should be permitted to address aspects of the external world as represented by the database, as well as aspects of the database itself, i.e., aspects of what the database knows about that external world. We shall also argue that integrity constraints are best viewed as sentences about what the database knows, not, as is usually the case, as first-order sentences about the external world. On this view, integrity constraints are modal sentences and hence are formally identical to a strict subset of the permissible database queries. Integrity maintenance then becomes formally identical to query evaluation for a certain class of database queries.  We formalize these notions in Levesque's language  KFOPCE  and define the concepts of an answer to a query and of a database satisfying its integrity constraints. We also show that Levesque's axiomatization of  KFOPCE  provides a suitable logic for reasoning about queries and integrity constraints. Next, we show how to do query evaluation and integrity maintenance for a restricted, but sizable, class of queries/constraints. An interesting feature of this class of queries/constraints is that Prolog's negation as failure mechanism serves to reduce query evaluation to first-order theorem proving. This provides independent confirmation that negation as failure is really an epistemic operator in disguise. We then provide sufficient conditions for the completeness of this query evaluator. Finally, we show how to use this evaluator to answer queries under the closed-world assumption.", "authors": ["Raymond Reiter"], "n_citation": 144, "references": ["0e126c0a-cbb8-496c-937b-8c4333b64149", "21f83041-72f5-4e21-bff3-b9e4742194e5", "2b4ae8b8-236b-4cbd-a02d-152ec8a5cec9", "3735a4c9-8f88-4e3e-9d01-93903302ff36", "4ff39e60-3f0b-4016-936f-ddd42477e625", "5364ca9c-67e8-4fb7-825a-14298066aae9", "6721cba3-7b11-459f-94f4-133c6c71164c", "70cbf480-918f-400c-8394-fd74f95fc417", "781001f3-f846-46d0-8044-833caa2c998e", "8cc60b40-a36b-41f7-a9ec-ccc5f3f848ba", "aa082d45-05e7-4300-a9e5-722ddc1441d9", "b3a28152-322e-4a1d-a60b-79497e220572", "ce2f6b94-ecd4-4f1c-8db3-eaedfd8367d2", "e0598b4b-840b-4339-9cf5-ed68a6c5eb56", "e0954269-cf86-4a9b-9808-09fe7a91a415", "fbf9cf1c-1733-4493-a720-ca8607ad3082"], "title": "What should a database know", "venue": "Journal of Logic Programming", "year": 1992, "id": "0ca394cb-09c9-434e-9b1b-648af6ce34c0"}
{"abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of a rigid body, with unknown inertia matrix, tracking a desired angular velocity reference using adaptive feedback control. The control law, which has the form of a sixth-order dynamic compensator, does not require knowledge of the inertia of the rigid body. A Lyapunov argument is used to guarantee that asymptotic tracking is achieved globally. Furthermore, an analytical expression for an upper bound on the magnitude of the required torque is presented for a given reference signal. Next, sufficient conditions on the reference signal are given under which asymptotic identification of the inertia matrix is achieved. Reference signals that satisfy these sufficient conditions are characterized and simulation results that illustrate the control algorithm are presented for a constant spin about a fixed axis and for sinusoidal spins about the body axes. The controller is implemented on an experimental testbed, and experiments are performed for several commanded reference signals. The experimental results demonstrate the tracking performance of the controller, and parameter convergence is observed", "authors": ["Nalin Chaturvedi", "Dennis S. Bernstein", "Jasim Ahmed", "F.

{"abstract": "We propose a new active queue management algorithm, called average rate early detection (ARED). An ARED gateway measures/uses the average packet enqueue rate as a congestion indicator, and judiciously signals end hosts of incipient congestion, with the objective of reducing packet loss ratio and improving link utilization. We show (via simulation in ns-2) that the performance of ARED is better than that of RED and comparable to that of BLUE in terms of packet loss rate and link utilization. We also explore the use of ARED in the context of the differentiated services architecture. We show analytically that the widely referenced queue management mechanism, RED with in and out (RIO) cannot achieve throughput assurance and proportional bandwidth sharing. We then extend ARED and propose a new queue management mechanism, called ARED with in and out (AIO), in the assured services architecture. To share surplus bandwidth in a rate-proportional manner, we incorporate into AIO the derived analytic results, and propose an enhanced version of AIO, called the differentiated-rate AIO (DAIO) mechanism.", "authors": ["Ling Su", "Rong Zheng", "Jennifer C.

The rapid development of these resources and tools using machine learning techniques for less computerized languages requires appropriately tagged corpus. We have used a Bengali news corpus, developed from the web archive of a widely read Bengali newspaper. The corpus contains approximately 34 million wordforms. This corpus is used for lexicon development without employing extensive knowledge of the language. We have developed the POS taggers using Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The lexicon contains around 128 thousand entries and a manual check yields the accuracy of 79.6%. Initially, the POS taggers have been developed for Bengali and shown the accuracies of 85.56%, and 91.23% for HMM, and SVM, respectively. Based on the Bengali news corpus, we identify various word-level orthographic features to use in the POS taggers. The lexicon and a Named Entity Recognition (NER) system, developed using this corpus, are also used in POS tagging. The POS taggers are then evaluated with Hindi and Telugu data.

{"abstract": "There is an increasing recognition for the need to develop high quality use case models from the professional and academic communities. Quality in use case models is of particular importance when they are utilized within a use case driven development process, whereby every aspect of development is driven by the models and influenced by their quality. Many practitioners and researchers have provided guidelines, suggestions and techniques to construct high quality use case models. This invaluable body of knowledge is disseminated across numerous literature resources. Without unifying this knowledge into one resource, it cannot be expected that a use case modeler would be fully aware of the entire body of knowledge and benefitting from it. This paper presents a systematic review that was conducted in order to identify and amalgamate this knowledge. The amalgamated knowledge is presented in a unified form, specifically as a set of 26 anti-patterns, which modelers can use to improve the quality of their models.", "authors": ["Mohamed El-Attar", "James Miller"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0782444f-8d06-4c08-a09e-8edf823c2a23", "08c0c4d7-735f-4500-9b52-914f38d26513", "16c94ca7-064b-4881-95b4-dcd49cf8a9fe", "352276a0-0ab4-4f01-918d-ac150bb3ebc8", "3a7cb7b4-6e90-4431-816e-e3bef4ca1abf", "5c86dc57-37b7-40a0-b52c-0b833506c1a6", "6a69a1c8-9c0f-494c-8457-c8e3bdea3d68", "6cd32b1b-18f6-457a-8a80-3bc4e1722017", "8451a732-dfa6-4a0a-9314-3f11f0551dd4", "9ecd112e-64fd-430b-a8f7-298ff9c505d0", "aa2e1007-c93b-4854-9248-9f650dd77461", "dade91d4-f9c3-4c12-a2bf-ff4d9a2e6902", "fffd0c5e-8266-4ceb-a0a3-c2d2fa2505d7"], "title": "Constructing high quality use case models: a systematic review of current practices", "venue": "Requirements Engineering", "year": 2012, "id": "e864f091-cc27-4329-b421-157aa3e3af54"}

{"abstract": "A novel routing protocol for computer networks is designed by combining two routing protocols that adapt to changes in the network topology. The first routing protocol is expensive to operate but yields shortest-paths in the networks; therefore, it is best used when changes in the network topology are rare. The second routing protocol is not as costly to operate, but may yield longer paths; hence, it is best used when changes in the network topology are frequent. By combining these two protocols, the resulting protocol has a wide domain of applicability that does not depend on the frequency of changes in the network topology. >", "authors": ["Anish Arora", "Mohamed G.

{"abstract": "Writing unit tests for a software system enhances the confidence that a system works as expected. Since time pressure often prevents a complete testing of all application details developers need to know which new tests the system requires. Developers also need to know which existing tests take the most time and slow down the whole development process. Missing feedback about less tested functionality and reasons for long running test cases make it, however, harder to create a test suite that covers all important parts of a software system in a minimum of time. As a result a software system may be inadequately tested and developers may test less frequently. Our approach provides test quality feedback to guide developers in identifying missing tests and correcting low-quality tests. We provide developers with a tool that analyzes test suites with respect to their effectivity (e.g., missing tests) and efficiency (e.g., time and memory consumption). We implement our approach, named Path Map, as an extended test runner within the Squeak Smalltalk IDE and demonstrate its benefits by improving the test quality of representative software systems.", "authors": ["Michael Perscheid", "Damien Cassou", "Robert Hirschfeld"], "n_citation": 14, "references": ["0310687f-b5ab-40da-84e6-f594b9efd80d", "10ce4b51-fc39-4b6b-afe4-2ae7b751fb2e", "3441b2b5-f794-486c-89c0-8e89d55acd2b", "4221a9b5-db06-4b0b-8db3-8f12660c7541", "46b00d36-de3f-475e-91f4-03a8edb7c060", "7b9a8163-aa1b-4bce-bc9f-cc1932eb5d90", "8bab1284-be24-432e-84f6-305ebf47bd36", "ab268b64-fac4-4947-9c11-8e3f9901b6b7", "acb5d7a4-2cd0-4e94-9343-9b05fab2505a", "affd42ab-961d-4e1c-9d3d-86840cced1e8", "b9416436-de2a-4d83-8899-53ef404a7130", "c6b8fbdb-54a1-489b-af5a-2e39cefc007d", "c91835e7-5d1b-433e-96c8-2486fda01262", "cf0a5b2a-c8f9-44f5-aeba-30333101ec1a", "d2a9b421-559d-4394-86aa-824cd62d8ab5", "ddc4dea3-a9f4-4a19-9e43-d28977f675ac", "e0783c00-90b9-4849-a650-114ffb62cf17", "ea0b66b2-5bde-4dbb-aba9-bad05952cfe1", "f2ca225a-4836-4881-9108-7065f0356ba9", "fa584e89-4893-4b45-ad2c-29f9b3d6da77"], "title": "Test Quality Feedback Improving Effectivity and Efficiency of Unit Testing", "venue": "conference on creating, connecting and collaborating through computing", "year": 2012, "id": "c54d00f5-1a02-4bac-8515-95ea3b055e2c"}

{"abstract": "In this paper, two novel joint semi-blind channel estimation and data detection techniques are proposed and investigated for Alamouti coded single-carrier (SC) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system using Rayleigh flat fading channel model. In the first novel semi-blind technique, blind channel estimation can be performed by using singular value decomposition (SVD) of received output autocorrelation matrix and training based channel estimation for orthogonal training symbols can be performed by using orthogonal pilot maximum likelihood (OPML) algorithm. Further using, that semi-blind channel estimate and received output, data detection is performed by using Maximum likelihood (ML) detection. Finally we derived new training symbols from error covariance matrix of estimated data and known orthogonal training symbols, which further applied to OPML algorithm for final channel estimate. In the second novel semi-blind technique, blind channel estimation can be performed by using matrix triangularization based on householder QR decomposition (H-QRD) of received output autocorrelation matrix instead of SVD decomposition. Other steps are same as the first novel technique to calculate data detection and final channel estimation. Simulation results are presented under 2-PSK, 4-PSK, 8-PSK and 16-QAM data modulation schemes using 2 transmitters and different combinations of receiver antennas to investigate the performances of novel techniques compare to conventional whitening rotation (WR) and rotation optimization maximum likelihood (ROML) based semi-blind channel estimation techniques.

{"abstract": "We have recently witnessed a growing interest in self organis- ing systems, both in research and in practice. These systems re-organise in response to new or changing conditions in the environment. The need for self organisation is often found in mobile applications; these applica- tions are typically hosted in resource-constrained environments and may have to dynamically reorganise in response to changes of user needs, to heterogeneity and connectivity challenges, as well as to changes in the execution context and physical environment. We argue that physically mobile applications benefit from the use of self organisation primitives. We show that a component model that incorporates code mobility primi- tives assists in building self organising mobile systems. We present satin, a lightweight component model, which represents a mobile system as a set of interoperable local components. The model supports reconfigura- tion, by offering code migration services. We discuss an implementation of the satin middleware, based on the component model and evaluate our work by adapting existing open source software as satin components and by building and testing a system that manages the dynamic update of components on mobile hosts.", "authors": ["Stefanos Zachariadis", "Cecilia Mascolo", "Wolfgang Emmerich"], "n_citation": 56, "references": ["115b3521-58a2-467f-9188-9185033f9e8f", "13678b40-189f-425f-9abb-78907158d090", "1dfb34d1-92de-453e-9cd2-ed1fb233672b", "24829bb4-274a-447b-b7a6-71695fb2e28d", "35a31e26-c9bc-44a7-9e10-c71584d8acda", "35d74f0d-b777-4413-8f32-ddf816b6eee0", "3e3c9915-93f3-4eb3-90d0-7889945635d0", "5ffb064d-8a9f-40c6-9a36-403263a84633", "678f0caf-8860-4f6b-a76f-478dcc45143a", "6b76c163-595b-4dc6-b35e-05ebd2610673", "9aec3b0d-a782-4ad1-9adb-620aa3b28989", "a2251202-6baf-4d29-a8ff-e344f154ab0a", "aa1ec612-3a09-4f72-9520-8cdf59539b4e", "afeda970-9aee-4699-b66a-823af8c12ff2", "bea77d25-d4d7-49b8-a783-6d28b9314af0", "d4e64144-8cd8-4c74-9cff-5dcff25f30cd", "df590681-3f63-43eb-bc7d-32851828d0c6"], "title": "SATIN: a component model for mobile self-organisation", "venue": "cooperative information systems", "year": 2004, "id": "f7cfa082-74e6-4f85-90a4-867d39ea2537"}
{"abstract": "This work presents an automatic technique for detection of abnormal events in crowds. Crowd behaviour is difficult to predict and might not be easily semantically translated. Moreover it is difficulty to track individuals in the crowd using state of the art tracking algorithms. Therefore we characterise crowd behaviour by observing the crowd optical flow and use unsupervised feature extraction to encode normal crowd behaviour. The unsupervised feature extraction applies spectral clustering to find the optimal number of models to represent normal motion patterns. The motion models are HMMs to cope with the variable number of motion samples that might be present in each observation window. The results on simulated crowds demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for detecting crowd emergency scenarios.", "authors": ["Ernesto L. Andrade", "Scott Blunsden", "Robert B.

{"abstract": "With the advent of small form-factor devices, protocol standardization, and robust protocol implementations, multi-hop mobile networks are witnessing widespread deployment. The monitoring of such networks is crucial for their robust operation. To this end, this paper presents DAMON, a distributed system for monitoring multi-hop mobile networks. DAMON uses agents within the network to monitor network behavior and send collected measurements to data repositories. DAMON's generic architecture supports the monitoring of a wide range of protocol, device, and network parameters. Other key features of DAMON include seamless support for multiple repositories, auto-discovery of sinks by the agents, and resiliency of agents to repository failures. We have implemented DAMON agents that collect statistics on data traffic and the ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) routing protocol. We have used our implementation to monitor an ad hoc network at the 58th Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) meeting held November 2003 in Minneapolis, MN. In this paper, we describe the architecture of DAMON and report on the performance of the IETF network using monitoring information collected by DAMON. Our network monitoring system is available online for use by other researchers.", "authors": ["Krishna N. Ramachandran", "Elizabeth M. Belding-Royer", "K.C.

This paper describes statistical algorithms of pitch contour conversion for Korean language. Pitch contour conversions are investigated at two levels of prosodic phrases: intonational phrase and accentual phrase. The basic algorithm is a Gaussian normalization in intonational phrase. The first presented algorithm is combined with a declination-line of pitch contour in an intonational phrase. The second one is Gaussian normalization within accentual phrases to compensate for local pitch variations. Experimental results show that the algorithm of Gaussian normalization within accentual phrases is significantly more accurate than the other two algorithms in intonational phrase.", "authors": ["Ki Young Lee", "Jong Kuk Kim", "Myung Jin Bae"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["57096a0a-c1e4-47b9-aef8-c0449ff0873e", "5b7b407f-f09f-4f80-9dc0-55e22ad1ccdf", "5dd980f8-4b8e-4e30-918b-3075ced84a01", "a28ce1ad-a683-49c4-bed3-05f4d21fcd36", "c104431f-67b5-40a1-8a2c-c1017b115de5", "eb8d9d88-eac5-4df1-bff0-07e3bd6cd77d"], "title": "Statistical Pitch Conversion Approaches Based on Korean Accentual Phrases", "venue": "pacific rim international conference on artificial intelligence", "year": 2004, "id": "d55a6adb-ab77-4aae-b1d1-819852bc6fe2"}

{"abstract": "A coupon represents the right to claim some service which is typically offered by vendors. In practice, issuing bundled multi-coupons is more efficient than issuing single coupons separately. The diversity of interests of the parties involved in a coupon system demands additional security properties beyond the common requirements (e.g., unforgeability). Customers wish to preserve their privacy when using the multi-coupon bundle and to prevent vendors from profiling. Vendors are interested in establishing a long-term customer relationship and not to subsidise one-time customers, since coupons are cheaper than the regular price. We propose a secure multi-coupon system that allows users to redeem a predefined number of single coupons from the same multi-coupon. The system provides unlinkability and also hides the number of remaining coupons of a multi-coupon from the vendor. A method used in the coupon system might be of independent interest. It proves knowledge of a signature on a message tuple of which a single message can be revealed while the remaining elements of the tuple, the index of the revealed message, as well as the signature remain hidden.", "authors": ["Liqun Chen", "Matthias Enzmann", "Ahmad-Reza Sadeghi", "Markus Schneider", "Michael Steiner"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["038919b7-ac0a-4de7-b8f0-6a861a991388", "0806da7c-aa3a-45a8-aa44-69587c95bc52", "16efed84-f1c7-43e5-a975-9616df9625c1", "1ded96cd-c4cd-4f00-ae4c-c8270f3418aa", "287082dd-0ac7-42aa-bdcc-86378e384892", "39b0a663-a520-4845-b722-537bf6c63ac5", "6f88cedd-17a0-44c7-9476-767e7e6caec9", "74e78dcd-048f-485e-8510-47efa520b77f", "96966ed5-51f8-4115-a38f-b5a5d9ddf2ee", "a44e864f-48d8-48e5-8b82-a6eb4d1450d4", "b554271c-ffbc-42ad-ba93-a3a17ec3a693", "ba5ec268-89bc-4e36-b4e1-d6694c24045e", "bf0daa4c-ded8-41d2-8fe3-b1b0b35c699d", "c517f47d-e19a-4792-b8c6-7c7ae5e589eb", "c662a3e3-c554-49a1-863e-cfc150023c47", "d813b516-e80f-4c08-9e9e-b9acb109b98d", "dda4ed45-c17a-482a-b49a-8a41693701cf", "ec6a0519-5962-4c38-959c-5eac254d29dd", "f7122597-a405-4e70-8e95-aadbb5e5bd77"], "title": "A privacy-protecting coupon system", "venue": "financial cryptography", "year": 2005, "id": "1defd6ce-2669-4fc9-9887-d5bcf057d0fc"}
{"abstract": "Efforts to provide connection oriented service over the inherently best-effort Internet started almost right after its birth. Today, there exist a multitude of solutions that have been proposed but have never been implemented due to their impracticability. We propose a practical solution for fast, low cost, scalable, and yet accurate QoS routing. We propose to use hierarchical approaches to make the scheme practical and cost-effective. At the same time, we increase network utilization and decrease inaccuracy of stale information by the use of multiple paths. An extensive simulation of the various permutations of schemes over a large set of topologies and traffic conditions validate the proposed schemes and prove conclusively that hierarchical schemes with multiple path capabilities not only result in significantly lower overhead, but also give high levels of QoS performance.

{"abstract": "BGT method improves the execution time of progressive alignment by 62%.OLM decreases the memory requirements by 75%, aligning up twice more sequences than previous method.MTA improves the alignments accuracy, letting it to regain the quality lost due to the performance improvements. Multiple Sequence Alignment (MSA) is essential for a wide range of applications in Bioinformatics. Traditionally, the alignment accuracy was the main metric used to evaluate the goodness of MSA tools. However, with the growth of sequencing data, other features, such as performance and the capacity to align larger datasets, are gaining strength. To achieve these new requirements, without affecting accuracy, the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources and techniques is crucial. In this paper, we apply HPC techniques in T-Coffee, one of the more accurate but less scalable MSA tools. We integrate three innovative solutions into T-Coffee: the Balanced Guide Tree to increase the parallelism/performance, the Optimized Library Method with the aim of enhancing the scalability and the Multiple Tree Alignment, which explores different alignments in parallel to improve the accuracy. The results obtained show that the resulting tool, MTA-TCoffee, is able to improve the scalability in both the execution time and also the number of sequences to be aligned. Furthermore, not only is the alignment accuracy not affected by these improvements, as would be expected, but it improves significantly. Finally, we emphasize that the presented methods are not just restricted to T-Coffee, but may be implemented in any other alignment tools that use similar algorithms (progressive alignment, consistency or guide trees).", "authors": ["Miquel Orobitg", "Fernando Guirado", "Fernando Cores", "Jordi Llad\u00f3s", "Cedric Notredame"], "n_citation": 10, "references": ["2da79fed-d9e7-4f37-a5e0-81d4aff2e810", "467c9fb4-07c9-4c86-8929-b646962e847c", "4706ac81-b8c9-463d-b10c-15dc25382bdd", "48f44ac1-7dc6-451c-8f0c-7c37d3e4c04b", "4e6b5714-02cb-4c98-8778-5006d113a211", "5459ecb2-2d59-45f2-bad9-a9172e168257", "571a77b7-ddd9-43a4-a5ca-54391f3b911c", "65135cb7-f592-4395-ad3b-d4cbc40c2527", "74ed9570-1d35-4ece-958d-f8c3086cee5a", "7cc21563-bb1d-478d-a81f-27d33304674b", "8d1854f7-21e4-4a4c-a123-1261f8bd1c88", "8dcf037a-3497-4635-b7a8-e6320061c3f8", "c7ff1075-0b22-47bf-a32b-fa86f43f610b", "d55f2d40-2568-4b0a-af34-9f62e7a02d3a", "e3d24655-feff-4e3b-a63f-a9a2066cca38", "e60d5c9c-e5b8-47dc-868a-539c52f8703a", "fb516abd-b31b-46fe-99ba-93ded5972678"], "title": "High Performance computing improvements on bioinformatics consistency-based multiple sequence alignment tools", "venue": "parallel computing", "year": 2015, "id": "906a8350-d8f7-4023-af31-9080a4c3d6c6"}

For Gaussian processes, we obtain bounds on the continuity modulus on the convex hull of a function class in terms of the same quantity for the class itself.

{"abstract": "When attempting to determine the number and set of execution failures that are caused by particular faults, developers must perform an arduous task of investigating and diagnosing each individual failure. Researchers proposed failure-clustering techniques to automatically categorize failures, with the intention of isolating each culpable fault. The current techniques utilize dynamic control flow to characterize each failure to then cluster them. These existing techniques, however, are blind to the intent or purpose of each execution, other than what can be inferred by the control-flow profile. We hypothesize that semantically rich execution information can aid clustering effectiveness by categorizing failures according to which functionality they exhibit in the software. This paper presents a novel clustering method that utilizes latent-semantic-analysis techniques to categorize each failure by the semantic concepts that are expressed in the executed source code. We present an experiment comparing this new technique to traditional control-flow-based clustering. The results of the experiment showed that the semantic-concept clustering was more precise in the number of clusters produced than the traditional approach, without sacrificing cluster accuracy.", "authors": ["Nicholas DiGiuseppe", "James A.

{"abstract": "The assignment of orthologous genes between a pair of genomes is a fundamental and challenging problem in comparative genomics. Existing methods that assign orthologs based on the similarity between DNA or protein sequences may make erroneous assignments when sequence similarity does not clearly delineate the evolutionary relationship among genes of the same families. In this paper, we present a new approach to ortholog assignment that takes into account both sequence similarity and evolutionary events at a genome level, where orthologous genes are assumed to correspond to each other in the most parsimonious evolving scenario under genome rearrangement. First, the problem is formulated as that of computing the signed reversal distance with duplicates between the two genomes of interest. Then, the problem is decomposed into two new optimization problems, called minimum common partition and maximum cycle decomposition, for which efficient heuristic algorithms are given. Following this approach, we have implemented a high-throughput system for assigning orthologs on a genome scale, called SOAR, and tested it on both simulated data and real genome sequence data. Compared to a recent ortholog assignment method based entirely on homology search (called INPARANOID), SOAR shows a marginally better performance in terms of sensitivity on the real data set because it is able to identify several correct orthologous pairs that are missed by INPARANOID. The simulation results demonstrate that SOAR, in general, performs better than the iterated exemplar algorithm in terms of computing the reversal distance and assigning correct orthologs.", "authors": ["Xin Chen", "Jie Zheng", "Zheng Fu", "Peng Nan", "Yang Zhong", "Stefano Lonardi", "Tao Jiang"], "n_citation": 180, "references": ["000fef72-f368-4eb9-8310-d8fa75413854", "0081b40b-95cf-4d98-941e-d2b003d456d7", "02ed122f-8651-4ac7-8d48-2700c3f66168", "21a4f243-3c16-464e-9b16-bbeb31aca39b", "28960bc3-4398-47a0-8856-61984648d56e", "465adf73-1a5a-4435-99ea-9c809253ef5c", "5cfd5f7e-c5f0-4fca-86be-15ede17a776e", "616f257f-bf99-4c41-9c60-8104eeb187d7", "61af5830-082a-4be0-9add-fc11c9f55718", "61d76fe4-a135-449f-99ba-123dd81d22da", "6d8e1eef-97a8-4121-b066-6295c4587124", "7f7cddc4-91d0-44d3-8dd1-96c1909ac694", "98755adf-ae77-4034-96cf-79a5a4105c65", "c1548e68-5973-4234-91da-bc3e79fdadfe", "cf49f77c-21fd-47a3-a66f-ac9eab7759e9", "e6e71d08-4f1d-4602-a2ef-7dd3d2567b69", "f735f10f-eeec-4278-9f8b-3b8c79a1d432"], "title": "Assignment of Orthologous Genes via Genome Rearrangement", "venue": "IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics", "year": 2005, "id": "9b371b54-0406-45fb-ad75-098ea16c1ddc"}

{"abstract": "Recently various real-time communication protocols have been proposed. In this paper, first, we propose a timed 1/0 automaton model so that we can simply specify such real-time protocols. The proposed model can handle not only time but also data values. Then, we propose a conformance testing method for the model. In order to trace a test sequence (1/0 sequence) on the timed 1/0 automaton model, we need to execute each 1/0 action in the test sequence at an adequate execution timing which satisfies all timing constraints in the test sequence. However, since outputs are given from JUTs and uncontrollable, we cannot designate their output timing in advance. Also their output timing affects the executable timing for the succeeding 1/0 actions in the test sequence. Therefore, in general, the executable timing of each input action in a test sequence can be specified by a function of the execution time of the preceding 1/0 actions. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to decide efficiently whether a given test sequence is executable. We also give an algorithm to derive such a function from an executable test sequence automatically using a technique for solving linear programming problems, and propose a conformance testing method using those algorithms.", "authors": ["Teruo Higashino", "Akio Nakata", "Kenichi Taniguchi", "Ana R.

This approach realizes a dynamical system that supplies each vehicle with a common reference to be used for cooperative motion. We prove a separation principle that decomposes formation stability into two components: Stability of this is achieved information flow for the given graph and stability of an individual vehicle for the given controller.

{"abstract": "Motivated by biomechanical studies on human walking, we present a control strategy for biologically realistic walking based on the principle of spin angular momentum regulation. Using a morphologically realistic human model and kinematic gait data, we compute the total spin angular momentum at a self-selected walking speed for one human test subject. We find that dimensionless spin angular momentum remains small (S/sub 1//(mass height velocity) < 0.02) throughout the gait cycle, and maximum whole body angular excursions within sagittal (<1/spl deg/), coronal (<0.2/spl deg/), and transverse (<2/spl deg/) planes are negligible. These data support the hypothesis that spin angular momentum in human walking is highly regulated by the central nervous system, and that there exists a nonlinear coupling between ground reaction force, F~, center of mass position, r~/sub CM/ , and center of pressure location, r~/sub CP/, or F~ = (FZ/sub ///Z/sub CM/)(r~/sub CM/ -r~/sub CP/). We employ this relationship to rapidly generate biologically realistic CP and CM reference trajectories. Using an open loop optimization strategy, we show that biologically realistic leg joint kinematics emerge through the minimization of spin angular momentum and the total sum of joint torque squared, suggesting that both angular momentum and energetic factors are important considerations for biomimetic controllers.", "authors": ["Marko B.

{"abstract": "We report in this paper a method for proving that a graph transformation is property-preserving. Our approach uses a relational representation for graph grammar and a logical representation for graph properties with first-order logic formulas. The presented work consists in identifying the general conditions for a graph grammar to preserve graph properties, in particular structural properties. We aim to implement all the relevant notions of graph grammar in the Isabelle/HOL proof assistant in order to allow a (semi) automatic verification of graph transformation with a reasonable complexity. Given an input graph and a set of graph transformation rules, we can use mathematical induction strategies to verify statically if the transformation preserves a particular property of the initial graph.

{"abstract": "Whenever multiple representations or models of a system exist, there is the possibility of defining how they relate. In model driven software development, it is essential that these mappings are defined precisely and automated as far as possible: they form the basis for generation of code and other models from a model, for reconciliation and management of consistency between models, and even for the definition of modeling languages themselves. A standard way of defining software modeling languages is metamodeling, which involves the construction of an object model of the syntax and, optionally, semantics of the language, using the diagrammatic syntax of the Unified Modeling Language (UML). This paper proposes an extension to UML for expressing mappings between models using diagrams, and illustrates how the extension can be used in metamodeling. The extension is inspired by mathematical relations and corrects a deficiency in the concept of association in class diagrams. The notation of object diagrams is also extended to allow particular instances of a relation to be presented.", "authors": ["Jan Hendrik Hausmann", "Stuart Kent"], "n_citation": 41, "references": ["198f9886-fc6c-4ec3-a576-afb1f095bc88", "53cfa569-cb85-4302-8b9e-7f62ed11933c", "5df3a54c-8184-48a7-a615-4461e4e9ccc1", "93596100-7e37-457f-9d3d-5b50462cb08d", "c3f1d4d1-32b0-474f-bc66-b216d664bc4b", "ed58035f-8664-42d9-8761-87674061c4fd"], "title": "Visualizing model mappings in UML", "venue": "software visualization", "year": 2003, "id": "b6b6ef8f-8374-46e0-bd13-b52dc2335c25"}

{"abstract": "This technical note is concerned with state-feedback stabilization of multi-input systems over parallel Gaussian channels subject to a total power constraint. Both continuous-time and discrete-time systems are treated under the framework of  H  2  control, and necessary/sufficient conditions for stabilizability are established in terms of inequalities involving unstable plant poles, transmitted power, and noise variances. These results are further used to clarify the relationship between channel capacity and stabilizability. Compared to single-input systems, a range of technical issues arise. In particular, in the multi-input case, the optimal controller has a separation structure, and the lower bound on channel capacity for some discrete-time systems is unachievable by linear time-invariant (LTI) encoders/decoders.", "authors": ["Zhan Shu", "Richard H.

The dynamic nature of our white-lists provides the flexibility necessary to encode a very precise security policy---namely, that  %n  -specifiers in  printf -style functions should modify a memory location  x  only if the programmer explicitly passes a pointer to  x . Our static dataflow analysis and source transformations let us automatically maintain and check the white-list without any programmer effort---they merely need to change the Makefile. Our analysis also detects pointers passed to  vprintf -style functions through (possibly multiple layers of) wrapper functions.

{"abstract": "Integrating disparate sources of information has been recognized as one of the keys to the success of general purpose vision systems. Image clues such as shading, texture, stereo disparities and image flows provide uncertain, local and incomplete information about the three-dimensional scene. Spatial a priori knowledge plays the role of filling in missing information and smoothing out noise. This thesis proposes a solution to the longstanding open problem of visual integration. It reports a framework, based on Bayesian probability theory, for computing an intermediate representation of the scene from disparate sources of information.#R##N#The computation is formulated as a labeling problem. Local visual observations for each image entity are reported as label likelihoods. They are combined consistently and coherently on hierarchically structured label trees with a new, computationally simple procedure. The pooled label likelihoods are fused with the a priori spatial knowledge encoded as Markov Random Fields (MRF's). The a posteriori distribution of the labelings are thus derived in a Bayesian formalism. A new inference method, Highest Confidence First (HCF) estimation, is used to infer a unique labeling from the a posteriori distribution. Unlike previous inference methods based on the MRF formalism, HCF is computationally efficient and predictable while meeting the principles of graceful degradation and least commitment. The results of the inference process are consistent with both observable evidence and a priori knowledge.#R##N#The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated with experiments on two image analysis problems: intensity edge detection and surface reconstruction. For edge detection, likelihood outputs from a set of local edge operators are integrated with a priori knowledge represented as an MRF probability distribution. For surface reconstruction, intensity information is integrated with sparse depth measurements and a priori knowledge. Coupled MRF's provide a unified treatment of surface reconstruction and segmentation, and an extension of HCF implements a solution method. Experiments using real image and depth data yield robust results. The framework can also be generalized to higher-level vision problems, as well as to other domains.", "authors": ["Paul B.

{"abstract": "Given the continued integration of intermittent renewable generators in electrical power grids, connection overloads are of increasing concern for grid operators. The risk of an overload due to injection variability can be described mathematically as a barrier-crossing probability of a function of a multidimensional stochastic process. Crude Monte Carlo is a well-known technique to estimate probabilities, but it may be computationally too intensive in this case as typical modern power grids rarely exhibit connection overloads. In this article, we derive an approximate rate function for the overload probability using results from large deviations theory. Based on this large deviations approximation, we apply a rare event simulation technique called splitting to estimate overload probabilities more efficiently than Crude Monte Carlo simulation.   We show on example power grids with up to 11 stochastic power injections that for a fixed accuracy, Crude Monte Carlo would require tens to millions as many samples as the proposed splitting technique required. We investigate the balance between accuracy and workload of three splitting schemes, each based on a different approximation of the rate function. We justify the workload increase of large-deviation-based splitting compared to naive splitting\u2014that is, splitting based on merely the Euclidean distance to the rare event set.

{"abstract": "This paper presents an approach whose objective is to support Web services substitution. Substitution means replacing a component with another component, as long as the replacing component produces the same output and satisfies the same requirements as the replaced component. Motives for substitution include Web service's non-responsiveness to client requests and better arrangement with another, competitor Web service. To perform Web services substitution with less impact on the ongoing, and sometimes critical, business processes, the approach proposes deploying communities of Web services. A community promotes the dynamic binding of Web services through a common interface, known as open service connectivity. The open service connectivity directs requests to and responses from Web services regardless of how these latter are specified, implemented, and located", "authors": ["Yehia Taher", "Djamal Benslimane", "Marie-Christine Fauvet", "Zakaria Maamar"], "n_citation": 114, "references": ["09164a85-3891-4d21-ac46-36f910a55a2b", "549066fb-1b80-4e17-9fcc-f4504235eed0", "597f3627-69d0-41bf-9a24-762beccddc81", "7c9b1eee-10b1-4d5f-b420-bb9b96b62393", "7f04fb61-ac70-43d3-ba2a-90d4ba5d103a", "a68aaccf-2bdb-45ee-8d52-dce68e65974e", "ddafe528-6732-4ec9-9934-d11526f8c7c5", "fa0aed8b-a70f-4a58-9aab-3283f080b173"], "title": "Towards an Approach forWeb services Substitution", "venue": "international database engineering and applications symposium", "year": 2006, "id": "4ed445e1-484e-4e5b-9fc7-b0bc5ba68d5d"}

A locally testable language is a language with the property that, for some nonnegative integer k, whether or not a word w is in the language depends on (1) the prefix and suffix of w of length k, and (2) the set of substrings of w length k+1, without regard to the order in which these substrings occur. The local testability problem is, given a deterministic finite automation, to decide whether or not it accepts a locally testable language.

{"abstract": "Previous studies on ventilatory control in obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) have generally indicated depressed chemosensitivity, implying greater stability of the chemical control of breathing in these subjects. However, these results were based on tests involving steady-state or quasi-steady measurements obtained in wakefulness. We have developed a method for assessing the dynamic stability characteristics of chemoreflex control in OSA patients during sleep. While continuous positive airway pressure was applied to stabilize the upper airways, acoustically stimulated arousals were used to perturb the respiratory system during sleep. The fluctuations in esophageal pressure that ensued were analyzed, using a closed-loop minimal model, to estimate the chemoreflex loop impulse response (CLIR). Tests using simulated data confirmed the validity of our estimation algorithm. Application of the method to arousal responses measured in six OSA and five normal subjects revealed no statistically significant differences in gain margins and loop gain magnitudes between the two groups. However, the CLIR in the OSA subjects exhibited faster and more oscillatory dynamics. This result implies that, in addition to unstable upper airway mechanics, an underdamped chemoreflex control system may be another important factor that promotes the occurrence of periodic obstructive apneas during sleep.", "authors": ["Musa H.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we consider reachability games over general hybrid systems, and distinguish between two possible observation frameworks for those games: either the precise dynamics of the system is seen by the players (this is the perfect observation framework), or only the starting point and the delays are known by the players (this is the partial observation framework). In the first more classical framework, we show that time-abstract bisimulation is not adequate for solving this problem, although it is sufficient in the case of timed automata . That is why we consider an other equivalence, namely the suffix equivalence based on the encoding of trajectories through words. We show that this suffix equivalence is in general a correct abstraction for games. We apply this result to o-minimal hybrid systems, and get decidability and computability results in this framework. For the second framework which assumes a partial observation of the dynamics of the system, we propose another abstraction, called the superword encoding, which is suitable to solve the games under that assumption.

We study rectangular hybrid automata where the plant state evolves continuously in real-numbered time, and the controller samples the plant state and changes the control state discretely, only at the integer points in time. We prove that rectangular hybrid automata have finite bisimilarity quotients when all control transitions happen at integer times, even if the constraints on the derivatives of the variables vary between control states. This is in contrast with the conventional model where control transitions may happen at any real time, and already the reachability problem is undecidable. Based on the finite bisimilarity quotients, we give an exponential algorithm for the symbolic sampling-controller synthesis of rectangular automata.

{"abstract": "In recent work we proposed a general model for hybrid dynamical systems whose states are defined on arbitrary metric space and evolve along some notion of generalized abstract time. For such systems we introduced the usual concepts of Lyapunov and Lagrange stability. We showed that it is always possible to transform this class of hybrid dynamical systems into another class of dynamical systems with equivalent qualitative properties, but defined on real time R^+=[0,~). The motions of this class of systems are in general discontinuous. This class of systems may be finite or infinite dimensional. For the above discontinuous dynamical systems (and hence, for the above hybrid dynamical systems), we established the Principal Lyapunov Stability Theorems as well as Lagrange Stability Theorems. For some of these, we also established converse theorems. We demonstrated the applicability of these results by means of specific classes of hybrid dynamical systems. In the present paper we continue the work described above. In doing so, we first develop a general comparison theory for the class of hybrid dynamical systems (resp., discontinuous dynamical systems) considered herein, making use of stability preserving mappings. We then show how these results can be applied to establish some of the Principal Lyaponov Stability Theorems. For the latter, we also state and prove a converse theorem not considered previously.

{"abstract": "The peer-to-peer (P2P) based video streaming has emerged as a promising solution for Internet video distribution. Leveraging the resource available at end users, this approach poses great potential to scale in the Internet. We have now seen the commercial P2P streaming systems that are orders of magnitude larger than the earlier academic systems. We believe understanding its basic principles and limitations are important in the design of future systems. The Coolstreaming, first released in summer 2004, arguably represented the first successful large-scale P2P live streaming system. Since then, the system has been significantly modified and commercially launched. This paper takes an inside look at the new Coolstreaming system by exposing its design options and rationale behind them, and examines their implications on streaming performance. Specifically, by leveraging a large set of traces obtained from recent live event broadcast and extensive simulations, we study the workload characteristics, system dynamics, and impact from a variety of system parameters. We demonstrate that there is a highly skewed resource distribution in such systems and the performance is mostly affected by the system dynamics. In addition, we show that there are inherent correlations and fundamental trade-off among different system parameters, which can be further explored to enhance the system performance.", "authors": ["Bo Li", "Susu Xie", "Yang Qu", "Gabriel Yik Keung", "Chuang Lin", "Jiangchuan Liu", "Xinyan Zhang"], "n_citation": 354, "references": ["0ecfa258-9274-4711-8c6d-3a2ef2976e3a", "19bb3151-ecc6-47d3-a639-476590858f2b", "1a492dc4-6ed2-4beb-b131-2236b4593304", "1eac5c45-a1a3-47a2-a731-053f9402c1e1", "20716a26-e8f3-4375-8d67-18dda5dec7ef", "3e29e582-55e5-4446-b4e5-f156368ae1a7", "436b5fcd-6488-4a4c-b41a-85130718b39a", "547e3594-2f10-4cb1-8c8d-55456229ae9b", "5de99dee-6647-4ebf-b20b-fe970cfd062b", "627284d7-8e09-4c8c-9a14-c67e13135e28", "680b411d-be1a-4aaf-9869-1f603761961f", "723271cf-1cbe-49ed-aefb-c282294a1cdc", "86ca04f6-4799-4e17-ba47-66fd0b4f6985", "86cab587-2c16-4c29-a0f4-68803931b27a", "917e65dc-9668-4e87-b359-47df78566ab3", "b09dd5d0-f4b8-47f3-981a-40b983f97795", "bf2819ae-ca81-4a69-921f-be00794a9048", "cbc01e36-33c2-4709-a00d-22e6d0727560", "da524b58-a800-4c60-8f7a-889096cdd649", "ebca9f89-edba-4d8f-90f0-351fd96286f1", "f75d3068-9764-4468-9ba8-2c43c91eacb0", "fdb4272b-35b9-4af5-8402-b7adfb5c27da"], "title": "Inside the New Coolstreaming: Principles, Measurements and Performance Implications", "venue": "international conference on computer communications", "year": 2008, "id": "48cc5cfb-1d9d-4a49-a1eb-d458551fe451"}

The discriminative random fields offer several advantages over the conventional Markov random field (MRF) framework. First, the DRFs allow to relax the strong assumption of conditional independence of the observed data generally used in the MRF framework for tractability. This assumption is too restrictive for a large number of applications in vision. Second, the DRFs derive their classification power by exploiting the probabilistic discriminative models instead of the generative models used in the MRF framework. Finally, all the parameters in the DRF model are estimated simultaneously from the training data unlike the MRF framework where likelihood parameters are usually learned separately from the field parameters.

{"abstract": "Advances in networking technologies will soon make it possible to use the global information infrastructure in a qualitatively different way--as a computational as well as an information resource. As described in the recent book The Grid: Blueprint for a New Computing Infrastructure, this Grid will connect the nation's computers, databases, instruments, and people in a seamless web of computing and distributed intelligence, which can be used in an on-demand fashion as a problem-solving resource in many fields of human endeavor--and, in particular, science and engineering. The availability of grid resources will give rise to dramatically new classes of applications, in which computing resources are no longer localized but, rather, distributed, heterogeneous, and dynamic; computation is increasingly sophisticated and multidisciplinary; and computation is integrated into our daily lives and, hence, subject to stricter time constraints than at present. The impact of these new applications will be pervasive, ranging from new systems for scientific inquiry, through computing support for crisis management, to the use of ambient computing to enhance personal mobile computing environments. To realize this vision, significant scientific and technical obstacles must be overcome. Principal among these is usability. The goal of the Grid Application Development Software (GrADS) project is to simplify distributed heterogeneous computing in the same way that the World Wide Web simplified information sharing over the Internet. To that end, the project is exploring the scientific and technical problems that must be solved to make it easier for ordinary scientific users to develop, execute, and tune applications on the Grid.

In other words, a new concept, finite-time input-to-state stability (FTISS), is proposed and then is applied to both the analysis of finite-time stability and the design of finite-time stabilizing feedback laws of control systems. With finite-time stability, nonsmoothness has to be considered, and serious technical challenges arise in the design of finite-time controllers and the stability analysis of the closed-loop system. It is found that FTISS plays an important role as the conventional ISS in the context of asymptotic stability analysis and smooth feedback stabilization. Moreover, a robust adaptive controller is proposed to handle nonlinear systems with parametric and dynamic uncertainties by virtue of FTISS and related arguments.", "authors": ["Yiguang Hong", "Zhong-Ping Jiang", "Gang Feng"], "n_citation": 94, "references": ["08b159b7-bc8a-4a4c-9357-ecca61578296", "0b595d8b-54f7-4d1f-8a02-872bd25557fc", "1f13cadc-5276-4b67-98ce-efb1148d42d4", "31242b09-38f2-4e83-8a9e-e2e9c7f8098d", "321fe466-0d5a-44b2-b1f6-25ab67a6f11b", "3db5fe42-5ef8-416f-bf6f-0c559305e088", "73a22879-ff25-4e25-9420-bee4e6a4ce9f", "8e1f94ec-71a9-47b4-a95d-1c9695f904db", "8efffaa2-6401-4a06-8b96-f2cfa21086c4", "b1a0c1a8-d1b5-4d87-a546-4738fe255621", "c08765d0-f363-4bc6-8d5a-6a4695a11fdd", "c4f5cf9c-3945-4f53-83d6-711b16e23f3b", "c758ea36-be89-4023-8c9d-fb6be2aa28fc", "e0eca1af-fcd4-4bbd-8ea2-944ca4b26df1", "f1e47215-c674-4d35-affb-6d0f46cccaf9"], "title": "Finite-Time Input-to-State Stability and Applications to Finite-Time Control Design", "venue": "Siam Journal on Control and Optimization", "year": 2010, "id": "f84a454b-85ac-440d-be00-2c1c53f0ca9e"}
{"abstract": "Humans and other animals are exquisitely attuned to their context. Context affects almost all aspects of behavior, and it does so for the most part automatically, without a conscious reasoning effort. This would be a very useful property for an artificial agent to have: upon recognizing its context, the agent's behavior would automatically adjust to fit it. This paper describescontext-mediated behavior(CMB), an approach to context-sensitive behavior we have developed over the past few years for intelligent autonomous agents. In CMB, contexts are represented explicitly ascontextual schemas(c-schemas). An agent recognizes its context by finding the c-schemas that match it, then it merges these to form a coherent representation of the current context. This includes not only a description of the context, but also information about how to behave in it. From that point until the next context change, knowledge for context-sensitive behavior is available with no additional effort. This is used to influence perception, make predictions about the world, handle unanticipated events, determine the context-dependent meaning of concepts, focus attention and select actions.

Results: We establish the mathematical foundations of our distance and illustrate its use by constructing a phylogeny of the Eutherian orders using complete unaligned mitochondrial genomes.

{"abstract": "In Sussman, Smereka, and Osher [ J. Comp. Phys., 94 (1994), pp. 146--159], a numerical scheme was presented for computing incompressible air--water flows using the level set method. Crucial to the above method was a new iteration method for maintaining the level set function as the signed distance from the zero level set. In this paper we implement a \"constraint\" along with higher order difference schemes in order to make the iteration method more accurate and efficient. Accuracy is measured in terms of the new computed signed distance function and the original level set function having the same zero level set. We apply our redistancing scheme to incompressible flows with noticeably better resolved results at reduced cost. We validate our results with experiment and theory. We show that our \"distance level set scheme\" with the added constraint competes well with available interface tracking schemes for basic advection of an interface. We perform basic accuracy checks and more stringent tests involving complicated interfacial structures.

{"abstract": "The iterative consensus problem requires a set of processes or agents with different initial values, to interact and update their states to eventually converge to a common value. Protocols solving iterative consensus serve as building blocks in a variety of systems where distributed coordination is required for load balancing, data aggregation, sensor fusion, filtering, and synchronization. In this paper, we introduce the private iterative consensus problem where agents are required to converge while protecting the privacy of their initial values from honest but curious adversaries. Protecting the initial states, in many applications, suffice to protect all subsequent states of the individual participants.   We adapt the notion of differential privacy in this setting of iterative computation. Next, we present (i) a server-based and (ii) a completely distributed randomized mechanism for solving differentially private iterative consensus with adversaries who can observe the messages as well as the internal states of the server and a subset of the clients.

{"abstract": "Scientific workflows, like other applications, benefit from the cloud computing, which offers access to virtually unlimited resources provisioned elastically on demand. In order to efficiently execute a workflow in the cloud, scheduling is required to address many new aspects introduced by cloud resource provisioning. In the last few years, many techniques have been proposed to tackle different cloud environments enabled by the flexible nature of the cloud, leading to the techniques of different designs. In this paper, taxonomies of cloud workflow scheduling problem and techniques are proposed based on analytical review. We identify and explain the aspects and classifications unique to workflow scheduling in the cloud environment in three categories, namely, scheduling process, task and resource. Lastly, review of several scheduling techniques are included and classified onto the proposed taxonomies. We hope that our taxonomies serve as a stepping stone for those entering this research area and for further development of scheduling technique. We propose taxonomies of cloud workflow scheduling problem and techniques.Aspects and classifications unique to cloud workflow scheduling are identified.Several techniques are reviewed and classified based on the proposed taxonomies.Some issues of future concern in cloud workflow scheduling are discussed.", "authors": ["Sucha Smanchat", "Kanchana Viriyapant"], "n_citation": 12, "references": ["060b8c59-fc63-4d32-ab96-4f2bab03cb62", "08377347-5182-4e21-bd1a-647b8a9c51a3", "0a1e88c8-2a52-4d2e-92b6-e58df125bba4", "0caef020-c59c-4093-a018-378a1d49f5ce", "0d2bdbe1-75d9-46c2-a707-af6012fa263c", "144f1440-1fbe-460b-a897-3ad32b468d2e", "1ae994d8-ddfa-4f61-bf18-8ea62039101f", "1ff265b9-f57a-4dc3-92dc-c4eb1c9d43b9", "27b4e16a-176b-416b-adfc-7f8367e46e55", "29303d89-14bd-4e3f-8e81-8914c3b1c6b4", "2d3d19dc-1945-49da-aa05-3fe49745d65a", "31dca16b-b8f8-4df3-898f-93400403a513", "378254e5-0f41-43f5-89fc-8cef105ea0ab", "3cad0f8f-b3dd-4f7d-9ca5-22849a61cda2", "4089feb5-3371-48b2-b242-808785435c1d", "4683ed35-de44-47b5-b62d-332e70bc1565", "4722b4c1-d73a-439f-8f74-cea6c31d2e0e", "4874e203-d286-4925-9675-d4e6739a3db5", "4c07c6e5-9964-419d-a525-04532710abb6", "4f672a80-abcf-4de8-bf7e-930e865fa35b", "511cd242-d606-4665-95fc-5986be633b20", "54477d54-5c6a-43c3-b0a5-9ffe9dcf7815", "565b447f-bb62-4191-9912-43761f416759", "60a59990-5d15-45c0-85fd-50e6c0deb6c4", "63377bf0-0fa5-4af1-a426-adea3000c8ef", "708fee28-bae5-46df-9064-dfa267b5f804", "71ee9690-a53c-41a2-bf6e-b04936b6efed", "75ed4e5d-ab02-4f25-9c01-c4539d288dd3", "7afe3589-76a1-41c8-a179-f6d858a7d298", "7f7fc265-785c-491c-b90f-f037a88f32ff", "854389d6-37fa-448e-af0a-5cc0fee6477d", "85a71eec-0012-4684-a01b-0fc3471969b8", "862dd47e-b8f1-4761-81da-c2b015a9d4cd", "88edf9cd-a81b-4689-93d9-b898960b9799", "891bed60-9b56-4c76-a74c-c95a71afd838", "8ceec117-a8d1-4edc-b49f-a3d87197f832", "918905d3-015a-4450-b3a1-b34025094906", "92734e92-d073-4fbf-b5aa-4d3c7bee2bd7", "984a81bd-c0d0-42dd-bf70-cb9632e22a54", "a9b36b1c-7d4c-4af9-9a15-bfaa3e9b38c6", "aad8d91e-c2eb-4c7d-a4b2-65a3a9351284", "ab44b658-2634-4be3-b501-d839ad407ba2", "b06244a6-ae4e-4303-81cd-8c1c4a56e270", "b072412c-a28e-42a4-8ed7-8f0abaf5915d", "b33b96e1-99c7-427b-b349-905d53563cb7", "b4886155-5449-4ae2-8c06-b90b346cfca5", "b7bcf40e-e48c-47d8-bd88-93657e844b20", "b8c3ce99-0155-4d21-917f-2473c0fabb68", "bc2cbff0-ba2b-40e7-bcb4-38fafbbed8ea", "c1c91baf-9f3b-4ccc-b9c6-75702e437223", "c4a47248-6f9f-4cb3-b2a9-0a866910388c", "cc503f51-4331-40a9-aabb-2e83c5522ced", "ce264684-7a2b-493f-9336-3b68071ebca1", "d0b56dc7-a2db-4ec7-8372-bf7016a2c70b", "db7d92d3-cf09-4681-addd-5367c01a556e", "e1733b48-50ac-4613-b73a-8a6341187bdf", "e56cd5ec-f544-45d8-a9f6-5b706880871b", "e6239045-7bdb-43b6-9a13-2ecf03260654", "eb68239c-7422-4b3b-92b6-af3c7c53ba7f", "eedb8cef-1e9d-4dce-8830-ff4f73280c23", "f7756dcd-1e64-43b1-aac1-0711517d80f6", "fc8517ee-0757-498c-abb9-c4d4c8400ff1", "ffcaa488-a435-44a2-8eae-b73280623dce"], "title": "Taxonomies of workflow scheduling problem and techniques in the cloud", "venue": "Future Generation Computer Systems", "year": 2015, "id": "7877c0b0-ff04-4e46-a24e-5ebe09432a18"}

The imaging modalities will include diffusion imaging (dMRI), resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI), task-evoked fMRI (T-fMRI), T1- and T2-weighted MRI for structural and myelin mapping, plus combined magnetoencephalography and electroencephalography (MEG/EEG).

{"abstract": "Formal methods, whereby a system is described and/or analyzed using precise mathematical techniques, is a well -established and yet, under-used approach for developing software systems. One of the reasons for this is that project deadlines often impose an unsatisfactory development strategy in which code is produced on an ad-hoc basis without proper thought about the requirements and design of the piece of software in mind. The result is a large, often poorly documented and un-modular monolith of code, which does not lend itself to formal analysis. Because of their complexity, formal methods work best when code is well structured, e.g., when they are applied at the modeling level. UML is a modeling language that is easily learned by system developers and, more importantly, an industry standard, which supports communication between the various project stakeholders. The increased popularity of UML provides a real opportunity for formal methods to be used on a daily basis within the software lifecycle. Unfortunately, the lack of preciseness of UML means that many formal techniques cannot be applied directly. If formal methods are to be given the place they deserve within UML, a more precise description of UML must be developed. This article surveys recent attempts to provide such a description, as well as techniques for analyzing UML models formally.", "authors": ["Jonathan Whittle"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0d261b6a-c94a-4d5e-b44e-eb6ae46581fc", "10635fdb-2d7d-4ee9-b12c-aada3ff1905b", "15a2d332-783d-4a0e-900c-faadda3c080c", "1bc7a6fc-cf5e-47fc-a120-40d10348e483", "1f201155-2b4f-42c3-b422-c0a03e2d5f8b", "241340ef-9225-48ca-9ea0-c248444d055c", "3044b32f-307a-49ef-adef-9945b5c68312", "315e451f-3672-4cd6-b967-9888b7f91663", "33656812-d386-470b-8df7-5b109f9e94a7", "3b0ed468-1043-42fd-a91a-e0ace1321e0d", "41cf9713-ed76-43a6-8e9f-538abc2f787c", "4d07ef09-b292-4b89-8ee7-7b153f4c2e05", "55574fc6-b747-4671-9c02-4a56b4a27af5", "672e4c8a-934f-45f7-a845-42162a02d438", "84e5959e-6042-4ab7-a4bc-2c26c5d48976", "96ca8241-6abd-462c-9105-6c078ddde65c", "d2066f80-cee4-4a18-809e-2623aab11229", "d6285e34-13fa-4327-b4f9-203181baa8c6", "d7022dda-b181-44e8-9d13-a46d962df21c", "fc7003f3-20c8-4f46-acbc-b95e151f9001"], "title": "Formal approaches to systems analysis using UML: an overview", "venue": "Journal of Database Management", "year": 2003, "id": "678d8d52-039b-423c-8194-e3de2a22be4c"}

{"abstract": "Abstract : A Markov decision process is a generalization of a Markov chain in which both probabilistic and nondeterministic choice coexist. Given a Markov decision process with costs associated with the transitions and a set of target states the stochastic shortest path problem consists in computing the minimum expected cost of a control strategy that guarantees to reach the target. In this paper, we consider the classes of stochastic shortest path problems in which the costs are all non-negative, or all non-positive. Previously, these two classes of problems could be solved only under the assumption that the policies that minimize or maximize the expected cost also lead to the target with probability 1. This assumption does riot necessarily hold for Markov decision processes that arise as model for distributed probabilistic systems. We present efficient methods for solving these two classes of problems without relying on additional assumptions. The methods are based on algorithms to transform the original problems into problems that satisfy the required assumptions. The methods lead to the efficient solution of two basic problems in the analysis of the reliability arid performance of partially-specified systems: the computation of the minimum (or maximum) probability of reaching a target set, and the computation of the minimum (or maximum) expected time to reach the set.", "authors": ["Luca de Alfaro"], "n_citation": 123, "references": ["10e8157e-963a-44e8-b4f6-f2cf054da376", "4519f883-e18a-45fa-9d16-c4ebde84bf0a", "63d1c97d-6dc5-460a-8a65-cdd3600ee387", "7053f8cb-6652-49cd-90c7-970c7498eb0c", "9aeb1bef-5dbb-4c56-8d8d-ff9d31d92dee", "aab8c482-f4bd-4e7b-b92a-63c2d002f55b", "e447a617-0a17-40a2-90c1-793af17b4832", "f1029115-54b8-42a1-a30c-9e76a2fcc3c7", "fd96428e-4edf-4457-a644-4fabbd986ae1"], "title": "Computing Minimum and Maximum Reachability Times in Probabilistic Systems", "venue": "international conference on concurrency theory", "year": 1999, "id": "2c8a5deb-76ee-4226-be66-64068118cfae"}
{"abstract": "We consider the problem of constructing logical topologies over a wavelength-routed optical network with no wavelength changers. We present a general linear formulation which considers routing traffic demands, and routing and assigning wavelengths to lightpaths, as a combined optimization problem. The formulation also takes into account the maximum number of hops a lightpath is permitted to take, multiple logical links in the logical topology, multiple physical links in the physical topology, and symmetry/asymmetry restrictions in designing logical topologies. The objective is to minimize congestion. We show by examples how equality and inequality logical degree constraints have a bearing on congestion. We prove that, under certain conditions, having equality degree constraints with multiple edges allowed in the design of logical topologies does not affect congestion. This helps in reducing the dimensionality of the search space and hence speeds up the search for an optimal solution of the linear formulation. We solve the linear formulation for small examples and show the tradeoff between congestion, number of wavelengths available and the maximum number of hops a lightpath is allowed to take. For large networks, we solve the linear formulation by relaxing the integer constraints. We develop topology design algorithms for large networks based on rounding the solutions obtained by solving the relaxed problem. Since the whole problem is linearizable, the solution obtained by relaxation of the integer constraints yields a lower bound on congestion. This is useful in comparing the efficiency of our heuristic algorithms. Following Bienstock and Gunluk (1995), we introduce a cutting plane which helps in obtaining better lower bounds on congestion and also enables us to reduce the previously obtained upper bounds on congestion.", "authors": ["Rajesh M.

{"abstract": "This paper concerns the self-assembly of scaled-up versions of arbitrary finite shapes. We work in the multiple temperature model that was introduced by Aggarwal, Cheng, Goldwasser, Kao, and Schweller (Complexities for Generalized Models of Self-Assembly, SIAM J. Comput. 2005). The multiple temperature model is a natural generalization of Winfree\u2019s abstract tile assembly model, where the temperature of a tile system is allowed to be shifted up and down as self-assembly proceeds. We first exhibit two constant-size tile sets in which scaled-up versions of arbitrary shapes self-assemble. Our first tile set has the property that each scaled shape self-assembles via an asymptotically \u201cKolmogorov-optimum\u201d temperature sequence but the scaling factor grows with the size of the shape being assembled. In contrast, our second tile set assembles each scaled shape via a temperature sequence whose length is proportional to the number of points in the shape but the scaling factor is a constant independent of the shape being assembled. We then show that there is no constant-size tile set that can uniquely assemble an arbitrary (non-scaled, connected) shape in the multiple temperature model, i.e., the scaling is necessary for self-assembly. This answers an open question of Kao and Schweller (Proceedings of the 17th Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms (SODA 2006), pp. 571\u2013580, 2006), who asked whether such a tile set exists.", "authors": ["Scott M.

{"abstract": "Cooperation is the fundamental underpinning of multi-agent systems, allowing agents to interact to achieve their goals. Where agents are self-interested, or potentially unreliable, there must be appropriate mechanisms to cope with the uncertainty that arises. In particular, agents must manage the risk associated with interacting with others who have different objectives, or who may fail to fulfil their commitments. Previous work has utilised the notions of motivation and trust in engendering successful cooperation between self-interested agents. Motivations provide a means for representing and reasoning about agents' overall objectives, and trust offers a mechanism for modelling and reasoning about reliability, honesty, veracity and so forth. This paper extends that work to address some of its limitations. In particular, we introduce the concept of a  clan : a group of agents who trust each other and have similar objectives. Clan members treat each other favourably when making private decisions about cooperation, in order to gain mutual benefit. We describe mechanisms for agents to form, maintain, and dissolve clans in accordance with their  self-interested  nature, along with giving details of how clan membership influences individual decision making. Finally, through some simulation experiments we illustrate the effectiveness of clan formation in addressing some of the inherent problems with cooperation among self-interested agents.", "authors": ["Nathan Griffiths", "Michael Luck"], "n_citation": 141, "references": ["186a6ec1-eb61-4b5f-8e62-ea1101d62fd6", "3be01e61-f105-4aaf-91b6-2b57b6ee7f6b", "40e179cf-6346-4eee-8267-9c70b2298cf7", "485b69b5-a452-4f6e-afa2-39106a402dba", "4f93c731-1c76-4a32-bbd8-c97001c57118", "985747b1-352d-431e-8c1d-964dc8593121", "a79a8af4-9c49-4e19-808b-159601aeecbf", "ac7265af-a4fc-410a-8c2e-25936fd5b4d5", "b43da11b-f29a-4675-ad5b-3d9a864558fb", "e2108000-bf67-43ce-9ce4-3a9130a7474f", "ff92e8e0-4674-4000-83a1-a7a532b1439d"], "title": "Coalition formation through motivation and trust", "venue": "adaptive agents and multi-agents systems", "year": 2003, "id": "eabf569f-d57a-480b-b2a8-756e729712d3"}
{"abstract": "This paper presents a framework for a logical characterization of fault tolerance and its formal analysis based on partial model checking techniques. The framework requires a fault tolerant system to be modeled using a formal calculus, here the CCS process algebra. To this aim we propose a uniform modeling scheme in which to specify a formal model of the system, its failing behaviour and possibly its fault-recovering procedures. Once a formal model is provided into our scheme, fault tolerance - with respect to a given property - can be formalized as an equational @m-calculus formula. This formula expresses, in a logic formalism, all the fault scenarios satisfying that fault tolerance property. Such a characterization understands the analysis of fault tolerance as a form of analysis of open systems and, thank to partial model checking strategies, it can be made independent from any particular fault assumption. Moreover this logical characterization makes possible the fault-tolerance verification problem be expressed as a general @m-calculus validation problem, for solving which many theorem proof techniques and tools are available.

Besides, P2P systems can be highly heterogeneous, i.e. they may consist of peers that range from old desktops behind modem lines to powerful servers connected to the Internet through high-bandwidth lines. In this paper, we address the problem of load balancing in such P2P systems. We explore the space of designing load-balancing algorithms that uses the notion of virtual servers. We present three schemes that differ primarily in the amount of information used to decide how to re-arrange load. Our simulation results show that even the simplest scheme is able to balance the load within 80% of the optimal value, while the most complex scheme is able to balance the load within 95% of the optimal value.", "authors": ["Ananth Rao", "Karthik Lakshminarayanan", "Sonesh Surana", "Richard M.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we show how online management of both quality of service (QoS) and provider revenue can be performed in CDMA cellular networks by adaptive control of system parameters to changing traffic conditions. The key contribution is the introduction of a novel call admission control and bandwidth degradation scheme for real-time traffic as well as the development of a Markov model for the admission controller. This Markov model incorporates important features of 3G cellular networks, such as CDMA intra- and intercell interference, different call priorities and soft handover. From the results of the Markov model the threshold for maximal call degradation is periodically adjusted according to the currently measured traffic in the radio access network. As a consequence, QoS and revenue measures can be optimized with respect to a predefined goal. To illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed QoS/revenue management approach, we present quantitative results for the Markov model and a comprehensive simulation study considering a half-day window of a daily usage pattern.", "authors": ["Christoph Lindemann", "Marco Lohmann", "Axel Th\u00fcmmler"], "n_citation": 75, "references": ["01c3a589-feb0-41f4-bd5e-1f4a6bd3e0e7", "161a1be1-a1fa-4da3-aa10-dd65de820ae4", "166df1e8-6abb-4337-b7e0-beebc54d4a8c", "1fbd2156-3b48-4260-9ad5-5b993012485b", "34010df3-7378-4383-9ed1-f483d4a3d237", "34787747-cb84-4a55-a59e-6d511eb129dc", "3b640ce3-49bf-4f8d-8717-90fcbb1f4ff2", "485de686-ed57-43fe-b7f1-5183ced668bd", "6019c6b6-5da8-4e0f-907b-feb3cae25733", "a20de26e-8ddb-49ec-b252-07c980eb01da", "b42784f0-61b7-41ab-86c3-dbb9717c64c9", "b6ac2b39-5136-4574-9eb7-ae92d9a3034b", "ba94747b-c958-4066-9ebb-ad664681547a", "d158ab42-14d4-444c-9322-89e687720d82", "d17c6230-b25b-4b7b-9112-f0a7fa827152", "e2c744b4-6159-4f68-b5cd-2d0918e9739a", "f2321bb8-ee9f-464a-8ff2-1b48cbbdfde6", "f4d0869c-b4e4-4810-a79d-b14fa255e1b8", "fb9b52a0-1ffb-4790-89e5-ca277f6d2bbb", "fd74a30b-3ee3-429e-97ea-0ab70f63889e"], "title": "Adaptive call admission control for QoS/revenue optimization in CDMA cellular networks", "venue": "Wireless Networks", "year": 2004, "id": "ccf87478-06df-41d5-b9b4-f382c83041d2"}

{"abstract": "Refactoring has become an integral part of modern software development, with wide support in popular integrated development environments (IDEs). Modern IDEs provide a fixed set of supported refactorings, listed in a refactoring menu. But with IDEs supporting more and more refactorings, it is becoming increasingly difficult for programmers to discover and memorize all their names and meanings. Also, since the set of refactorings is hard-coded, if a programmer wants to achieve a slightly different code transformation, she has to either apply a (possibly non-obvious) sequence of several built-in refactorings, or just perform the transformation by hand.   We propose a novel approach to refactoring, based on synthesis from examples, which addresses these limitations. With our system, the programmer need not worry how to invoke individual refactorings or the order in which to apply them. Instead, a transformation is achieved via three simple steps: the programmer first indicates the start of a code refactoring phase; then she performs some of the desired code changes manually; and finally, she asks the tool to complete the refactoring.   Our system completes the refactoring by first extracting the difference between the starting program and the modified version, and then synthesizing a  sequence  of refactorings that achieves (at least) the desired changes. To enable scalable synthesis, we introduce  local refactorings , which allow for first discovering a refactoring sequence on small program fragments and then extrapolating it to a full refactoring sequence.   We implemented our approach as an Eclipse plug-in, with an architecture that is easily extendable with new refactorings. The experimental results are encouraging: with only minimal user input, the synthesizer was able to quickly discover complex refactoring sequences for several challenging realistic examples.", "authors": ["Veselin Raychev", "Max Sch\u00e4fer", "Manu Sridharan", "Martin T.

{"abstract": "This paper studies the use of mathematical programming for the repair and restoration of a transmission system after a significant disruption (e.g., a natural disaster). Such blackouts may last several days and have significant impact on human and economic welfare. The transmission system repair and restoration problem (TSRRP) consists in dispatching crews to repair damaged electrical components in order to minimize the size of the blackout. The TSRRP can be modeled as a large-scale mixed nonlinear, nonconvex program, including both routing components and the nonlinear steady-state power flow equations. To tackle its daunting computational complexity, this paper proposes a 2-stage approach, decoupling the restoration and repair aspects. The first step is a restoration ordering problem, a mixed nonlinear, nonconvex program which is approximated by a mixed integer program. The approximation does not use the traditional DC power flow approximation which is plagued by convergence issues and inoperable dispatches; rather, it uses the recent LPAC approximation that captures reactive power and voltage magnitudes. The second stage is a pickup and repair routing problem which is solved using a constraint-programming model, large neighborhood search, and a randomized adaptive decomposition. Experimental results on benchmarks based on the US electrical infrastructures and state-of-the-art damage scenarios indicate that the 2-stage approach provides significant improvements over the \"best practice\" in the field.", "authors": ["Pascal Van Hentenryck", "Carleton Coffrin"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["13451b63-7635-4cfa-aad0-cf187101a599", "1353382c-7a8f-4605-a1b9-b918b4a72a9a", "2c359706-0162-4715-a8ae-330c2781607c", "2fb3bd66-88e0-4769-b0ae-3fbdc59cbbef", "304640df-5c19-43cc-b3cd-766dc4e68615", "34d16ea6-fe00-4165-9d27-860db7b48405", "39f7ec86-5671-46b4-b443-30373f939c84", "5e6029b0-9986-4b0c-936b-a37ae0971c0d", "7066852b-42aa-4519-949e-ff0bbd5c2b0d", "94a54cdb-24cb-401c-9f12-b6e6e97d9cfe", "bd5db7ea-730d-40ff-8abf-794f36567711", "c12cb89b-52b2-4218-a3ca-81ebb844687c", "d572ade7-ae9c-40b9-8f3e-2eaf9eb4b6f0", "e1b681d0-66fc-48b3-903d-978925bc60d7"], "title": "Transmission system repair and restoration", "venue": "Mathematical Programming", "year": 2015, "id": "f8c28afe-6dd2-47c2-a665-c65d233b07fc"}

{"abstract": "Whereas the upper bound lemma for matrix cross-product, introduced by Park (1999) and modified by Moon, Park, Kwon, and Lee (2001), plays a key role in guiding various delay-dependent criteria for delayed systems, the Jensen inequality has become an alternative as a way of reducing the number of decision variables. It directly relaxes the integral term of quadratic quantities into the quadratic term of the integral quantities, resulting in a linear combination of positive functions weighted by the inverses of convex parameters.

{"abstract": "Traditionally, the development of computing systems has been focused on performance improvements driven by the demand of applications from consumer, scientific, and business domains. However, the ever-increasing energy consumption of computing systems has started to limit further performance growth due to overwhelming electricity bills and carbon dioxide footprints. Therefore, the goal of the computer system design has been shifted to power and energy efficiency. To identify open challenges in the area and facilitate future advancements, it is essential to synthesize and classify the research on power- and energy-efficient design conducted to date. In this study, we discuss causes and problems of high power/energy consumption, and present a taxonomy of energy-efficient design of computing systems covering the hardware, operating system, virtualization, and data center levels. We survey various key works in the area and map them onto our taxonomy to guide future design and development efforts.

{"abstract": "Even seemingly simple drawings, diagrams, and sketches are hard for computer programs to interpret, because these inputs can be highly variable in several respects. This variability corrupts the expected mapping between a prior model of a configuration and an instance of it in the scene. We propose a scheme for representing ambiguity explicitly, within a subgraph matching framework, that limits its impact on the computational and program complexity of matching. First, ambiguous alternative structures in the input are explicitly represented by coupled subgraphs of the data graph, using a class of segmentation post-processing operations termed graph elaboration. Second, the matching process enforces mutual exclusion constraints among these coupled alternatives, and preferences or rankings associated with them enable better matches to be found early on by a constrained optimization process. We describe several elaboration processes, and extend a straightforward constraint-based subgraph matching scheme to elaborated data graphs. The discussion focuses on the domain of human stick figures in diverse poses.\u00a9 (2001) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

It refers to a variety of operations modifying a model for various purposes such as analysis, optimization, and code generation. Most of these transformations need to be bidirectional to e.g. report analysis results, or keep coherence between models. In several application-oriented papers it has been shown that triple graph grammars are a promising approach to bidirectional model transformations. But up to now, there is no formal result showing under which condition corresponding forward and backward transformations are inverse to each other in the sense of information preservation.

{"abstract": "Vehicle-to-vehicle communication is a promising technology for enhanced road safety as it provides the possibility to get a detailed knowledge about the traffic situation a long way ahead. Vehicles transmit information about nearby dangers like obstacles on the road as well as warning messages over long distances to all vehicles in a certain area. Therefore the dissemination of the data has to be done in broadcast transmission. This transmission concept causes severe problems regarding the organization of the medium access. The often used RTS/CTS mechanism is no longer feasible, which is especially problematic in road scenarios, where the hidden station problem is a major cause of data loss due to collisions. In addition the regarded data makes high demands on the provided quality of service. Especially reliability and delay are crucial for the efficiency of the warning system. In this paper we introduce a concept for a medium access control which minimizes the effects of the hidden station problem by introducing a clustering scheme. Therefore clusterheads among the vehicles are selected, which are then responsible for assigning bandwidth to the other vehicles in their clusters. This paper presents an algorithm for selecting the clusterheads along with a concept for assigning bandwidth to the nodes.", "authors": ["Yvonne Gunter", "Bernhard Wiegel", "H. P.

Modeling the SDMs entails decomposing their methods into components and analyzing the structure and functioning of the components. The classification of the components illustrates which components address similar design issues and/or have similar structures. Similar components then may be further modeled to aid in more precisely understanding their similarities and differences. The models of the SDMs are also used as the bases for conjectures and analyses about the differences between the SDMs. This paper describes three experiments that we carried out in evaluating CDM. The first uses CDM to compare Jackson System Development (JSD) and Booch's (1986) object-oriented design. The second uses CDM to compare two other pairs of SDMs. The last one compares some of our comparisons with other comparisons done in the past using different approaches. The results of these experiments demonstrate that process modeling is valuable as a powerful tool in analysis of software development approaches. >", "authors": ["Xiping Song", "Leon J.

{"abstract": "As a new generation of multimodal systems begins to emerge, one dominant theme will be the integration and synchronization requirements for combining modalities into robust whole systems. In the present research, quantitative modeling is presented on the organization of users' speech and pen multimodal integration patterns. In particular, the potential malleability of users' multimodal integration patterns is explored, as well as variation in these patterns during system error handling and tasks varying in difficulty. Using a new dual-wizard simulation method, data was collected from twelve adults as they interacted with a map-based task using multimodal speech and pen input. Analyses based on over 1600 multimodal constructions revealed that users' dominant multimodal integration pattern was resistant to change, even when strong selective reinforcement was delivered to encourage switching from a sequential to simultaneous integration pattern, or vice versa. Instead, both sequential and simultaneous integrators showed evidence of  entrenching  further in their dominant integration patterns ( i.e. , increasing either their inter-modal lag or signal overlap) over the course of an interactive session, during system error handling, and when completing increasingly difficult tasks. In fact, during error handling these changes in the co-timing of multimodal signals became the main feature of hyper-clear multimodal language, with elongation of individual signals either attenuated or absent. Whereas Behavioral/Structuralist theory cannot account for these data, it is argued that Gestalt theory provides a valuable framework and insights into multimodal interaction. Implications of these findings are discussed for the development of a coherent theory of multimodal integration during human-computer interaction, and for the design of a new class of adaptive multimodal interfaces.", "authors": ["Sharon L.

{"abstract": "The problem of path planning for an automaton moving in a two-dimensional scene filled with unknown obstacles is considered. The automaton is presented as a point; obstacles can be of an arbitrary shape, with continuous boundaries and of finite size; no restriction on the size of the scene is imposed. The information available to the automaton is limited to its own current coordinates and those of the target position. Also, when the automaton hits an obstacle, this fact is detected by the automaton's \"tactile sensor.\" This information is shown to be sufficient for reaching the target or concluding in finite time that the target cannot be reached. A worst-case lower bound on the length of paths generated by any algorithm operating within the framework of the accepted model is developed; the bound is expressed in terms of the perimeters of the obstacles met by the automaton I in the scene. Algorithms that guarantee reaching the target (if the target is reachable), and tests for target reachability are presented. The efficiency of the algorithms is studied, and worst-case upper I bounds on the length of generated paths are produced. 9", "authors": ["Vladimir J. Lumelsky", "Alexander A.

{"abstract": "Checkpointing and replaying is an attractive technique that has been used widely at the operating/runtime system level to provide fault tolerance. Applying such a technique at the application level can benefit a range of software engineering tasks such as testing of long-running programs, automated debugging, and dynamic slicing. We propose a checkpointing/replaying technique for Java that operates purely at the language level, without the need for JVM-level or OS-level support. At the core of our approach are static analyses that select, at certain program points, a safe subset of the program state to capture and replay. Irrelevant statements before the checkpoint are eliminated using control-dependence-based slicing; the remaining statements together with the captured run-time values are used to indirectly recreate the call stack of the original program at the checkpoint. At the checkpoint itself and at certain subsequent program points, the replaying version restores parts of the program state that are necessary for execution of the surrounding method. Our experimental studies indicate that the proposed static and dynamic analyses have the potential to reduce significantly the execution time for replaying, with low run-time overhead for checkpointing.", "authors": ["Guoqing Xu", "Atanas Rountev", "Yan Tang", "Feng Qin"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["05dd259f-bc12-4b6f-8290-49f9edc589a2", "076e53a8-7022-4c3f-8033-39a160853e95", "0fbb9c37-41a6-449b-bd73-be8ac680687d", "11f52fe3-4eca-4818-9bcf-9e24cdc76fb5", "1ea0b9e1-756b-4b5c-8fa4-c7b8eef229a4", "21272ee9-f02b-4c47-8728-50a104f89ea0", "2fcfe3e9-287b-487f-ae40-eef8e3afa097", "30505a63-6a9b-4614-aacf-5d7531eca52e", "308d5af9-fcd6-4645-b834-4a3148de4700", "5511b151-927c-4a7b-aaa3-9eff626512d3", "58f68055-36b0-41cc-bf97-958c5de5c849", "62ea2256-8334-46fa-8ca1-aac92c4f5818", "6797aa1f-b44a-496f-add8-f3e5002485b9", "6fbd6e3c-ffdc-4c45-81ef-bc3c2e984baa", "70120fef-3bbe-4ff7-b033-75d19c361cbc", "79342533-bc5f-4119-9c3c-2704a111d2ff", "79a9fa4c-6e2d-4aa4-beb7-35daa36aff3d", "7c813997-94bd-42aa-a46d-41c39c947fd5", "7c98cebd-8ad4-4402-8332-bb738545b985", "8ce6d2da-e4ff-4b1d-abc3-a61e2cbf6ce1", "9dddf29d-dcfe-4a5c-85cc-6a7b6b2d91b4", "adae4167-6e4a-47d0-bda0-f7090a978ece", "b002d517-0f60-418d-86c6-5509cf9bc9a0", "b9637a12-b807-4f69-b5bd-80deeb9d209f", "b9d8e80b-76d9-49b3-b83b-18fead1834bd", "c848f4e4-01e7-4714-ab7c-e245a83eb355", "da37771c-a1fd-45c5-82b6-d3511328effe", "dc492c37-ce50-4729-bd27-6ce0f1b057cc", "dc9b5e57-3f4a-41f2-a150-c1cc26fb4400", "dda02a56-4814-46f0-ab6f-91c3ca9ba058", "e4865fbd-5e52-487f-8103-4952097473e4"], "title": "Efficient checkpointing of java software using context-sensitive capture and replay", "venue": "foundations of software engineering", "year": 2007, "id": "bf29019b-4838-40ed-9b13-47dbe2970426"}
{"abstract": "The enormous growth in the number of documents in the World Wide Web increases the need for improved link navigation and path analysis models. Link prediction and path analysis are important problems with a wide range of applications ranging from personalization to Web server request prediction. The sheer size of the World Wide Web coupled with the variation in users' navigation patterns makes this a very difficult sequence modelling problem. In this paper, the notion of probabilistic link prediction and path analysis using Markov chains is proposed and evaluated. Markov chains allow the system to dynamically model the URL access patterns that are observed in navigation logs based on the previous state. Furthermore, the Markov chain model can also be used in a generative mode to automatically obtain tours. The Markov transition matrix can be analysed further using eigenvector decomposition to obtain `personalized hubs/authorities'. The utility of the Markov chain approach is demonstrated in many domains: HTTP request prediction, system-driven adaptive Web navigation, tour generation, and detection of `personalized hubs/authorities' from user navigation profiles. The generality and power of Markov chains is a first step towards the application of powerful probabilistic models to Web path analysis and link prediction.", "authors": ["Ramesh R.

{"abstract": "As development on a software project progresses, developers shift their focus between different topics and tasks many times. Managers and newcomer developers often seek ways of understanding what tasks have recently been worked on and how much effort has gone into each; for example, a manager might wonder what unexpected tasks occupied their team's attention during a period when they were supposed to have been implementing new features. Tools such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) can be used to extract a set of independent topics from a corpus of commit-log comments. Previous work in the area has created a single set of topics by analyzing comments from the entire lifetime of the project. In this paper, we propose windowing the topic analysis to give a more nuanced view of the system's evolution. By using a defined time-window of, for example, one month, we can track which topics come and go over time, and which ones recur. We propose visualizations of this model that allows us to explore the evolving stream of topics of development occurring over time. We demonstrate that windowed topic analysis offers advantages over topic analysis applied to a project's lifetime because many topics are quite local.", "authors": ["Abram Hindle", "Michael W.

{"abstract": "In optimization, multiple objectives and constraints cannot be handled independently of the underlying optimizer. Requirements such as continuity and differentiability of the cost surface add yet another conflicting element to the decision process. While \"better\" solutions should be rated higher than \"worse\" ones, the resulting cost landscape must also comply with such requirements. Evolutionary algorithms (EAs), which have found application in many areas not amenable to optimization by other methods, possess many characteristics desirable in a multiobjective optimizer, most notably the concerted handling of multiple candidate solutions. However, EAs are essentially unconstrained search techniques which require the assignment of a scalar measure of quality, or fitness, to such candidate solutions. After reviewing current revolutionary approaches to multiobjective and constrained optimization, the paper proposes that fitness assignment be interpreted as, or at least related to, a multicriterion decision process. A suitable decision making framework based on goals and priorities is subsequently formulated in terms of a relational operator, characterized, and shown to encompass a number of simpler decision strategies. Finally, the ranking of an arbitrary number of candidates is considered. The effect of preference changes on the cost surface seen by an EA is illustrated graphically for a simple problem. The paper concludes with the formulation of a multiobjective genetic algorithm based on the proposed decision strategy. Niche formation techniques are used to promote diversity among preferable candidates, and progressive articulation of preferences is shown to be possible as long as the genetic algorithm can recover from abrupt changes in the cost landscape.", "authors": ["Carlos M.

{"abstract": "A device that performs private key operations (signatures or decryptions), and whose private key operations are protected by a password, can be immunized against offline dictionary attacks in case of capture by forcing the device to confirm a password guess with a designated remote server in order to perform a private key operation. Recent proposals for achieving this allow untrusted servers and require no server initialization per device. In this paper we extend these proposals to enable dynamic delegation from one server to another; i.e., the device can subsequently use the second server to secure its private key operations. One application is to allow a user who is traveling to a foreign country to temporarily delegate to a server local to that country the ability to confirm password guesses and aid the user's device in performing private key operations, or in the limit, to temporarily delegate this ability to a token in the user's possession. Another application is proactive security for the device's private key, i.e., proactive updates to the device and servers to eliminate any threat of offline password guessing attacks due to previously compromised servers.", "authors": ["Philip D.

{"abstract": "Association rule mining remains a very popular and effective method to extract meaningful information from large datasets. It tries to find possible associations between items in large transaction based datasets. In order to create these associations, frequent patterns have to be generated. The \"Apriori\" algorithm along with its set of improved variants, which were one of the earliest proposed frequent pattern generation algorithms still remain a preferred choice due to their ease of implementation and natural tendency to be parallelized.   While many efficient single-machine methods for Apriori exist, the massive amount of data available these days is far beyond the capacity of a single machine. Hence, there is a need to scale across multiple machines to meet the demands of this ever-growing data. MapReduce is a popular fault-tolerant framework for distributed applications. Nevertheless, heavy disk I/O at each MapReduce operation hinders the implementation of efficient iterative data mining algorithms, such as Apriori, on MapReduce platforms.   A newly proposed in-memory distributed dataflow platform called  Spark  overcomes the disk I/O bottlenecks in MapReduce. Therefore, Spark presents an ideal platform for distributed Apriori. However, in the implementation of Apriori, the most computationally expensive task is the generation of candidate sets having all possible pairs for singleton frequent items and comparing each pair with every transaction record. Here, we propose a new approach which dramatically reduces this computational complexity by eliminating the candidate generation step and avoiding costly comparisons.   We conduct in-depth experiments to gain insight into the effectiveness, efficiency and scalability of our approach. Our studies show that our approach outperforms the classical Apriori and state-of-the-art on Spark by many times for different datasets.", "authors": ["Sanjay Rathee", "Manohar Kaul", "Arti Kashyap"], "n_citation": 18, "references": ["07f57c70-0572-4daa-ab9d-c07a1df9dd15", "24bc92f5-9330-49a6-aad0-86e6ccd2b0fd", "34b7e270-80d7-46d5-a6f1-e50087a8d045", "3d315e53-9798-4254-9e57-6de8598c1b93", "3e9cb21c-d6d8-4214-994f-f372076c24da", "563cc48e-b8d7-411b-9334-e63ff7f64f71", "59af7e25-c0ee-4af5-acea-a58dfe4ccac4", "6779de57-7a13-4f68-b89f-642531e37df2", "71e2f2bd-a219-4a4e-a604-912a364ebcd8", "b687f1df-50b5-405f-94a0-4e8f95678920", "c4710c73-497d-44f0-ae10-64613eca18d4", "cedd7a26-0809-4e2c-af22-46833fff70c2", "e921437f-769b-4ca4-9298-3b75de07ec3d", "fb0a382c-a1f1-4f0c-8e80-36fe5fbbfb86", "ffe5a476-4faf-4848-8e80-024db2e25b35"], "title": "R-Apriori: An Efficient Apriori based Algorithm on Spark", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "id": "68fc655e-5a11-4530-9010-8aa1eae51a15"}

While the primary goal of PDPs is to avoid or combat congestion, the individual PDP designs can significantly affect application throughput, network utilization, performance fairness, and synchronization problems with multiple transmission control protocol (TCP) connections.

{"abstract": "The creation of precise, complete, platform independent models, whose implementation code can be fully generated for different target platforms, is often considered a key factor in Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). The execution of UML models is already a reality, mainly due to the adoption of the Action Semantics. However, UML and its action language are object-oriented based and certain concerns, called crosscutting concerns (e.g., encryption), can not be adequately encapsulated in single design modules. Such concerns result in scattered and tangled representations, which hinder system development, maintenance and evolution as well as the reusability of individual design modules. Aspect-Oriented Software Development (AOSD) has proven in recent years to be a useful technology for alleviating these shortcomings of object-orientation.

{"abstract": "Observed breakdowns in human-machine communication can be explained, in part, by the nature of current automation feedback, which relies heavily on focal visual attention. Such feedback is not well suited for capturing attention in case of unexpected changes and events or for supporting the parallel processing of large amounts of data in complex domains. As suggested by multiple-resource theory, one possible solution to this problem is to distribute information across various sensory modalities. A simulator study was conducted to compare the effectiveness of visual, tactile, and redundant visual and tactile cues for indicating unexpected changes in the status of an automated cockpit system. Both tactile conditions resulted in higher detection rates for, and faster response times to, uncommanded mode transitions. Tactile feedback did not interfere with, nor was its effectiveness affected by, the performance of concurrent visual tasks. The observed improvement in task-sharing performance indicates that the introduction of tactile feedback is a promising avenue toward better supporting human-machine communication in event-driven, information-rich domains.", "authors": ["Aaron Sklar", "Nadine B.

{"abstract": "We present a method to mine maximal generalized decision rules from databases by integrating discretization, generalization and rough sets feature selection. Our method reduces the data horizontally and vertically. In the first phase, discretization and generalization are integrated and the numeric attributes are discretized into a few intervals. Primitive values of symbolic attributes are replaced by high level concepts and some obvious superfluous or irrelevant symbolic attributes are also eliminated. Horizontal reduction is accomplished by merging identical tuples after the substitution of an attribute value by its higher level value in a predefined concept hierarchy for symbolic attributes or the discretization of continuous (or numeric) attributes. In the second phase, a novel context sensitive feature merit measure is used to rank the features, a subset of relevant attributes is chosen based on rough sets theory and the merit values of the features. A reduced table is obtained by removing those attributes which are not in the relevant attributes subset and the data set is further reduced vertically without destroying the interdependence relationships between the classes and the attributes. Rough sets based value reduction is further performed on the reduced table and all redundant condition values are dropped, finally, tuples in the reduced table are transformed into a set of maximal generalized decision rules. The experimental results on UCI data sets and an actual market database shows that our method can dramatically reduce the feature space and improve the learning accuracy.", "authors": ["Xiaohua Hu", "Nick Cercone"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["2dbceebc-4169-4897-97a7-a73e2491d940", "42bd4971-02a1-4755-b685-6d350b378e98", "4c420803-5eda-4eb5-a4ab-bd8bda0b6e56", "685b313d-8a77-481e-9456-e405a1d29549", "80bcd4d1-c1cd-43a7-bc4d-42e274324933", "8f2e1a56-39e9-4ca5-92ac-7effd48f0906", "936187f8-f6c2-412c-bdd2-0b4f5d60f8df"], "title": "Learning maximal generalized decision rules via discretization, generalization and rough set feature selection", "venue": "international conference on tools with artificial intelligence", "year": 1997, "id": "a21a447b-b701-4737-ab8a-452ef8519b7b"}

In contrast to other attempts, our tests are generated using a coarse equivalence class partitioning of the specification. To analyze the specification, to synthesize the timed tests, and to guarantee coverage with respect to a coverage criterion, we use the efficient symbolic techniques recently developed for model checking of real-time systems.

Most botnet-detection approaches function at the network level and require the analysis of packets' payloads, raising privacy concerns and incurring large computational overheads. Moreover, network traffic analysis alone can seldom provide a complete picture of botnets' behavior. By contrast, in-host detection approaches are useful to identify each bot's host-wide behavior, but are susceptible to the host-resident malware if used alone. To address these limitations, we consider both the coordination within a botnet and the malicious behavior each bot exhibits at the host level, and propose a C&C protocol-independent detection framework that combines host- and network-level information for making detection decisions.

In the case of stationary leaders, we propose a distributed containment control algorithm and study conditions on the network topology and the control gains to guarantee asymptotic containment control in any dimensional space. In the case of dynamic leaders, we study two cases: leaders with an identical velocity and leaders with nonidentical velocities. For the first case, we propose two distributed containment control algorithms to solve, respectively, asymptotic containment control under a switching directed network topology and finite-time containment control under a fixed directed network topology. In particular, asymptotic containment control can be achieved for any dimensional space if the network topology is fixed and for only the 1-D space if the network topology is switching. For the second case, we propose a distributed containment control algorithm under a fixed network topology where the communication patterns among the followers are undirected and derive conditions on the network topology and the control gains to guarantee asymptotic containment control for any dimensional space.

{"abstract": "Current-generation automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems model spoken discourse as a quasi-linear sequence of words and phones. Because it is unusual for every phone within a word to be pronounced in a standard (\"canonical\") way, ASR systems often depend on a multi-pronunciation lexicon to match an acoustic sequence with a lexical unit. Since there are, in practice, many different ways for a word to be pronounced, this standard approach adds a layer of complexity and ambiguity to the decoding process which, if simplified, could potentially improve recognition performance. Systematic analysis of pronunciation variation in a corpus of spontaneous English discourse (Switchboard) demonstrates that the variation observed is more systematic at the level of the syllable than at the phonetic-segment level. Thus, syllabic onsets are realized in canonical form far more frequently than either coda or nuclear constituents. Prosodic prominence and lexical stress also appear to play an important role in pronunciation variation. The governing mechanism is likely to involve the informational valence associated with syllabic and lexical elements, and for this reason pronunciation variation offers a potential window onto the mechanisms responsible for the production and understanding of spoken language.", "authors": ["Steven Greenberg"], "n_citation": 374, "references": ["157950a6-65a7-43ad-994e-7edfcb566f3c", "37ca8b9a-c277-441a-a051-161b6805ba32", "3b529dc2-82b7-4014-9141-d47709e78064", "426f9913-40e2-41bc-b513-0ffcbb835b0d", "51f222dc-cac4-47a0-b968-b3705341f568", "64b8fb43-a86e-4c05-897e-0eecde49fdde", "8d639aa0-f590-4637-82a9-1e09a74090a4", "9f1c57c9-ae6c-4e00-b3ee-10256adb3cb1", "d139d381-e490-4bd9-b065-8491be79e454"], "title": "Speaking in shorthand - A syllable-centric perspective for understanding pronunciation variation", "venue": "Speech Communication", "year": 1999, "id": "56588f27-23d8-460a-92b9-2efde499494d"}
{"abstract": "We address the problem of video quality prediction and control for high-resolution video transmitted over lossy packet networks. In packet video, the bitstream flows through several subsystems (coder, network, decoder); each of them can impair the information, either by data loss or by introducing some delay. However, each of these subsystems can be fine-tuned in order to minimize these problems and to optimize the quality of the delivered signal, taking into account the available bitrate. The assessment of the end-user quality is a non-trivial issue. We analyse how the user-perceived quality is related to the average encoding bitrate for variable bit rate MPEG-2 video. We then show why simple distortion metrics may lead to inconsistent interpretations. Furthermore, for a given coder setup, we analyse the effect of packet loss on the user-level quality. We then demonstrate that, when jointly studying the impact of coding bit rate and packet loss, the reachable quality is upperbound and exhibits one optimal coding rate for a given packet loss ratio.", "authors": ["Olivier Verscheure", "Pascal Frossard", "M.

{"abstract": "A multinomial logit model of brand choice, calibrated on 32 weeks of purchases of regular ground coffee by 100 households, shows high statistical significance for the explanatory variables of brand loyalty, size loyalty, presence/absence of store promotion, regular shelf price and promotional price cut. The model is parsimonious in that the coefficients of these variables are modeled to be the same for all coffee brand-sizes. The calibrated model predicts remarkably well the share of purchases by brand-size in a hold-out sample of 100 households over the 32-week calibration period and a subsequent 20-week forecast period. The success of the model is attributed in part to the level of detail and completeness of the household panel data employed, which has been collected through optical scanning of the Universal Product Code in supermarkets.#R##N##R##N#Three short-term market response measures are calculated from the model: regular (depromoted) price elasticity of share, percent increase in share for a promotion with a median price cut, and promotional price cut elasticity of share.

{"abstract": "Malware has become the centerpiece of most security threats on the Internet. Malware analysis is an essential technology that extracts the runtime behavior of malware, and supplies signatures to detection systems and provides evidence for recovery and cleanup. The focal point in the malware analysis battle is how to detect versus how to hide a malware analyzer from malware during runtime. State-of-the-art analyzers reside in or emulate part of the guest operating system and its underlying hardware, making them easy to detect and evade. In this paper, we propose a transparent and external approach to malware analysis, which is motivated by the intuition that for a malware analyzer to be transparent, it must not induce any side-effects that are unconditionally detectable by malware. Our analyzer, Ether, is based on a novel application of hardware virtualization extensions such as Intel VT, and resides completely outside of the target OS environment. Thus, there are no in-guest software components vulnerable to detection, and there are no shortcomings that arise from incomplete or inaccurate system   emulation.

{"abstract": "In this paper we address the problem of motion planning in the presence of state uncertainty, also known as planning in belief space. The work is motivated by planning domains involving nontrivial dynamics, spatially varying measurement properties, and obstacle constraints. To make the problem tractable, we restrict the motion plan to a nominal trajectory stabilized with a linear estimator and controller. This allows us to predict distributions over future states given a candidate nominal trajectory. Using these distributions to ensure a bounded probability of collision, the algorithm incrementally constructs a graph of trajectories through state space, while efficiently searching over candidate paths through the graph at each iteration. This process results in a search tree in belief space that provably converges to the optimal path. We analyze the algorithm theoretically and also provide simulation results demonstrating its utility for balancing information gathering to reduce uncertainty and finding low cost paths.", "authors": ["Adam Bry", "Nicholas Roy"], "n_citation": 224, "references": ["175a1cf7-6597-4604-a600-0a71b5c61157", "23899f66-b427-4812-a5f2-2560bf61a021", "2574cb5a-7915-4362-83e2-0f6dda15e004", "4773f1f0-89a2-4cd1-849a-6f2925f0cccb", "4b05d3f9-58ac-47cf-ba5f-6358721b7d87", "634d98e6-f163-4ce8-ba84-a1f901dc985d", "83aa800d-431b-4ba1-9e0d-412631608f55", "8fdb8e3f-75b7-4f3e-9726-16d427a9ed55", "f2d742df-9ac7-4b2f-9a8c-5d2880d4a431", "fe3c6200-2951-4a22-a623-c12c6eae432f"], "title": "Rapidly-exploring Random Belief Trees for motion planning under uncertainty", "venue": "international conference on robotics and automation", "year": 2011, "id": "18e888d9-5e31-4fe8-8771-27fd5ef5517f"}
{"abstract": "Many theories of human debugging rely on complex mental constructs that offer little practical advice to builders of software engineering tools. Although hypotheses are important in debugging, a theory of navigation adds more practical value to our understanding of how programmers debug. Therefore, in this paper, we reconsider how people go about debugging in large collections of source code using a modern programming environment. We present an information foraging theory of debugging that treats programmer navigation during debugging as being analogous to a predator following scent to find prey in the wild. The theory proposes that constructs of scent and topology provide enough information to describe and predict programmer navigation during debugging, without reference to mental states such as hypotheses. We investigate the scope of our theory through an empirical study of 10 professional programmers debugging a real-world open source program. We found that the programmers' verbalizations far more often concerned scent-following than hypotheses. To evaluate the predictiveness of our theory, we created an executable model that predicted programmer navigation behavior more accurately than comparable models that did not consider information scent. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for enhancing software engineering tools.", "authors": ["Joseph Lawrance", "Christopher Bogart", "Margaret M. Burnett", "Rachel K. E.

{"abstract": "The pairing heap is well regarded as an efficient data structure for implementing priority queue operations. It is included in the GNU C++ library. Strikingly simple in design, the pairing heap data structure nonetheless seems difficult to analyze, belonging to the genre of self-adjusting  data structures. With its design originating as a self-adjusting analogue of the Fibonacci heap, it has been previously conjectured that the pairing heap provides constrant amortized time decrease-key operations, and experimental studies have supported this conjecture. This paper demonstrates, contrary to conjecture, that the pairing heap requires more than constant amortized time to perform decrease-key operations. Moreover, new experimental findings are presented that reveal detectable growth in  the amortized cost of the decrease-key operation.  Second, a unifying framework is developed that includes both pairing heaps and Fibonacci heaps. The parameter of interest in this framework is the storage capacity available in the nodes of the data structure for auxiliary balance information fields.

To improve the response time of fault-tolerant applications, Star implements non-blocking and incremental checkpointing to perform an efficient backup of process state. Moreover, Star is application independent, highly configurable. Star actually runs on top of SunOs and is easily portable to UNIX\u2122-like operating systems.

{"abstract": "Even with the significant focus on IP address lookup in the published literature as well as focus on this market by commercial semiconductor vendors, there is still a challenge for router architects to find solutions that simultaneously meet 3 criteria: scaling in terms of lookup speeds as well as table sizes, the ability to perform high speed updates, and the ability to fit into the overall memory architecture of an Level 3 forwarding engine or packet processor with low systems cost overhead. In this paper, we describe a scheme that meets all three criteria. By contrast, published and commercial semiconductor solutions meet some but not all of these three criteria.For example, many approaches that provide dense tables have poor update times; others require large amounts of expensive high speed memory dedicated to this application. Many IP address lookup approaches do not take into account the flexibility of ASICs or the structure of modern high speed memory technologies such as RLDRAM[1] and FCRAM[2]. In this paper, we present a family of IP lookup schemes using a data structure that compactly encodes large prefix tables in order to address the criteria listed above. We also present a series of optimizations to the core algorithm that allows the memory access width of the algorithm to be reduced at the cost of memory references or allocated memory. Such flexibility in performance versus density is an important feature for the lookup engine of routers that may be deployed in different networks with varying requirements on address lookup length and table density (e.g. global IPv4 networks, global v6, VPN based v4 networks, MPLS, and IP tunneling encapsulation points).", "authors": ["Will Eatherton", "George Varghese", "Zubin Dittia"], "n_citation": 341, "references": ["1f3e3d4d-bd15-4ea3-9748-42502894712f", "35bf84dd-82f4-4a45-a114-bfe8c635c2c4", "38d55967-5a13-4d2f-b77f-49e54c113a08", "54dda14f-01d4-411e-97fa-5d27389e566c", "56fad217-58da-4f8a-8898-dc293ebc2002", "8aecb3cd-988c-437f-9286-3db1feff44b6", "ad41cab3-caa5-41f4-a6e0-2e0c974d7048", "ae941637-b658-4a15-be8d-f32109e5f510", "cb9ecaa2-69e2-4fd6-8884-27c83c150760", "cdedb3ff-5c7d-402f-a03c-18c0ee6748ce", "e401b22f-f2eb-483a-ad16-3b36bba814a4", "e80c59fb-2f00-48b1-845a-a46e18afca99", "ef8d1d29-6395-47a0-a1b4-91169df0741e"], "title": "Tree bitmap: hardware/software IP lookups with incremental updates", "venue": "acm special interest group on data communication", "year": 2004, "id": "44f1b9d8-3e17-4583-99bd-02debbd73d54"}

The framework contains two phases: choosing the resource configuration, and determining a module binding for each resource. We introduce a powerful model called an acceptability function which models design objectives, based on tradeoffs among different design constraints as well as a user's willingness to accept a design. Module utility measure cooperating with inclusion scheduling is the key to the success of our method. The utility of a module reflects the usefulness of the module based on the acceptability function. Inclusion scheduling is an algorithm to provide information for determining the number of functional units as well as module usefulness. We also present a heuristic which modifies module utility values based on the given acceptability function until they lead to superior selections.

{"abstract": "This paper describes algorithms for inserting monitoring code to profile and trace programs. These algorithms greatly reduce the cost of measuring programs with respect to the commonly used technique of placing code in each basic block. Program profiling counts the number of times each basic block in a program executes. Instruction tracing records the sequence of basic blocks traversed in a program execution. The algorithms optimize the placement of counting/tracing code with respect to the expected or measured frequency of each block or edge in a program's control-flow graph. We have implemented the algorithms in a profiling/tracing tool, and they substantially reduce the overhead of profiling and tracing.  We also define and study the hierarchy of profiling problems. These  problems have two dimensions: what is profiled (i.e., vertices (basic blocks) or edges in a control-flow graph) and where the instrumentation code is placed (in blocks or along edges). We compare the optimal solutions to the profiling problems and describe a new profiling problem: basic-block profiling with edge counters. This problem is important because an optimal solution to any other profiling problem (for a given control-flow graph) is never better than an optimal solution to this problem. Unfortunately, finding an optimal placement of edge counters for vertex profiling appears to be a hard problem in general. However, our work shows that edge profiling with edge counters works well in practice because it is simple and efficient and finds optimal counter placements in most cases.  Furthermore, it yields more information than a vertex profile. Tracing also benefits from placing instrumentation code along edges rather than on vertices.", "authors": ["Thomas Ball", "James R.

{"abstract": "More and more multicast communications are becoming real-time. In real-time communications, messages must be transmitted to their destination nodes within a certain amount of time; otherwise the messages will be rendered futile. To support real-time multicast communications, computer networks have to guarantee an upper bound on the end-to-end delay from the source node to each of the destination nodes. This is known as the multicast end-to-end delay problem. On the other hand, if the same message fails to arrive at each destination node at the same time, there will probably arise inconsistency or unfairness problem among users. This is related to the multicast delay variation problem. Our research subject is concerned with the minimization of multicast delay variation under the multicast end-to-end delay constraint. The problem has been proved to be NP-complete and a heuristic algorithm for it called DVMA (delay variation multicast algorithm) has been proposed. In this paper we find that in spite of DVMA's smart performance in terms of multicast delay variations, its time complexity is as high as O(klmn/sup 4/). It is strongly believed that such a high time complexity does not fit in a modern high-speed computer network environment. Therefore, we present an alternative heuristic algorithm with a much lower time complexity O(mn/sup 2/) and with a satisfactory performance.

{"abstract": "This paper argues for a design driven approach to an object-oriented CS1-CS2 sequence in which object-orientation is thematic. Our approach integrates several components: (i) a strong object-oriented approach, (ii) design using UML, (iii) design patterns to manage complexity, and (iv) complex examples and projects to motivate the use of object-orientation and to motivate students by solving non-trivial problems. While this is a \"programming-first\" approach to CS1-CS2, it addresses several disadvantages of programming-first approaches noted in CC2001 [7]. The approach focuses on design rather than syntax, so students do not lose sight of the forest for the trees. We use (relatively speaking) large and complex examples, especially in the CS2 course, which allows us to address in a meaningful way issues of programming in the large. Because the approach is design driven and heavily object oriented, the course is not biased against novices in favor of students with prior programming experience, since CS1 students with prior programming experience typically have no design experience and only procedural programming experience.", "authors": ["Carl Alphonce", "Phil Ventura"], "n_citation": 59, "references": ["42ea6086-62ba-4bfa-b59c-4e454c848818", "48c57447-4e52-40f4-ac8c-52560df44397", "8bf32b34-bf22-49d0-8668-29c560ffa93d", "fb675f4e-8d51-446c-b702-4990a27701c5", "fd4f4dfd-0b8e-4723-b001-d80620d396c0"], "title": "Object orientation in CS1-CS2 by design", "venue": "technical symposium on computer science education", "year": 2002, "id": "c66286d7-26b8-4118-8a32-a9472d777cf4"}

{"abstract": "The author introduces a scheme for the local processing of visual information, called the Hermite transform. The problem is addressed from the point of view of image coding, and therefore the scheme is presented as an analysis/resynthesis system. The objectives of the present work, however, are not restricted to coding. The analysis part is designed so that it can also serve applications in the area of computer vision. Indeed, derivatives of Gaussians, which have found widespread application in feature detection over the past few years, play a central role in the Hermite analysis. It is also argued that the proposed processing scheme is in close agreement with current insight into the image processing that is carried out by the human visual system. In particular, it is demonstrated that the Hermite transform is in better agreement with human visual modeling than Gabor expansions. >", "authors": ["Jean-Bernard Jean-Bernard Martens"], "n_citation": 77, "references": ["0b260dc1-88a1-4cbf-8116-2e7eeb9d3ed1", "17aaf918-52ec-4b30-baf1-b067b4fc8e74", "1e03955f-6dc9-44fb-8b49-c9953c8f9d36", "2b516348-df6a-4f46-ab4d-bc90089114d3", "305d8d4b-2190-4461-8fa5-bd48e9ba5201", "383a35cc-9b62-41ba-b07d-99b7a7d46199", "5c35f13c-a191-4d36-91f0-ec3981dc2a41", "7d5e97d2-5ebe-4be2-ac67-3c15fcde2c8d", "8747f12d-32f3-4156-a0b9-ad8d8c8df8f5", "938b98e9-7c7e-4d9e-9d26-53f5f9c44c25", "9a92e0a9-35da-4bda-9eeb-4027496f68ba", "ab2cb905-a1a4-481c-83be-e156ebff3288", "ac129832-39b9-407d-aff3-582c209145f3", "c7e45d01-93dc-4912-a686-9191d1a91e81", "de6f98ad-845e-4d5f-9c4f-548ad77e560e", "e389fa97-0461-4d42-876f-31d67c0690ca", "ee3fa7f4-a88d-4b58-8ee8-843370ed51be", "fad0058a-cf91-4f4e-859a-12d817db5d53"], "title": "The Hermite transform-theory", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing", "year": 1990, "id": "a5b9fd7f-78c8-48b3-86ad-7b963b9a9dea"}

We show that the trajectories of an extremum seeking system can be approximated by the trajectories of a system which involves certain Lie brackets of the vector fields of the extremum seeking system. It turns out that the Lie bracket system directly reveals the optimizing behavior of the extremum seeking system. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical foundation and prove that uniform asymptotic stability of the Lie bracket system implies practical uniform asymptotic stability of the corresponding extremum seeking system. We use the established results in order to prove local and semi-global practical uniform asymptotic stability of the extrema of a certain map for multi-agent extremum seeking systems.", "authors": ["Hans-Bernd D\u00fcrr", "Milos S.

{"abstract": "Collaborative technologies such as group support systems (GSS) are of ten developed to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of teams; however, the satisfaction users have with the processes and outcomes of the teamwork itself often determines the ultimate adoption and sustained use of collaborative technologies. Much of the research on teamwork has focused on meetings in particular and, consequently, satisfaction with the process and outcomes of meetings, referred to collectively as meeting satisfaction. Research on meeting satisfaction in GSS-supported groups has been equivocal, indicating the need for advancement in our theoretical understanding of the construct. To that end, this paper presents a causal model of meeting satisfaction derived from goal setting theory. The model is tested with an empirical study consisting of 15 GSS groups and 11 face-to-face (FTF) groups engaged in the \"lost at sea\" task. The results of analysis using structural equation modeling indicate support for the model's integrity across both GSS and FTF groups. Implications for researchers and practitioners are discussed, including how the model can be used to improve future research on the use of collaborative technology to support teamwork.", "authors": ["Bruce A.

In this paper, we describe a multistart local search algorithm for the prize-collecting Steiner tree problem, based on the generation of initial solutions by a primal-dual algorithm using perturbed node prizes. Path-relinking is used to improve the solutions found by local search and variable neighborhood search is used as a post-optimization procedure. Computational experiments involving different algorithm variants are reported. Our results show that the local search with perturbations approach found optimal solutions on nearly all of the instances tested. \u00a9 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.", "authors": ["Sylvio Canuto", "Mauricio G.

{"abstract": "This paper presents the material needed for exposing the reader to the advantages of using Prolog as a language for describing succinctly most of the algorithms needed in prototyping and implementing compilers or producing tools that facilitate this task. The available published material on the subject describes one particular approach in implementing compilers using Prolog. It consists of coupling actions to recursive descent parsers to produce syntax-trees which are subsequently utilized in guiding the generation of assembly language code. Although this remains a worthwhile approach, there is a host of possibilities for Prolog usage in compiler construction. The primary aim of this paper is to demonstrate the use of Prolog in parsing and compiling. A second, but equally important, goal of this paper is to show that Prolog is a labor-saving tool in prototyping and implementing many non-numerical algorithms which arise in compiling, and whose description using Prolog is not available in the literature. The paper discusses the use of unification and nondeterminism in compiler writing as well as means to bypass these (costly) features when they are deemed unnecessary. Topics covered include bottom-up and top-down parsers, syntax-directed translation, grammar properties, parser generation, code generation, and optimizations. Newly proposed features that are useful in compiler construction are also discussed. A knowledge of Prolog is assumed.", "authors": ["Jacques Cohen", "Timothy J.

{"abstract": "In formal design verification, successful model checking is typically preceded by a laborious manual process of constructing design abstractions. We present a methodology for partially-and in some cases, fully-bypassing the abstraction process. For this purpose, we provide to the designer abstraction operators which, if used judiciously in the description of a design, structure the corresponding state space hierarchically. This structure can then be exploited by verification tools, and makes possible the automatic and exhaustive exploration of state spaces that would otherwise be out of scope for existing model checkers. Specifically, we present the following contributions: - A temporal abstraction operator that aggregates transitions and hides intermediate steps. Mathematically, our abstraction operator is a function that maps a flat transition system into a two-level hierarchy where each atomic upper-level transition expands into an entire lower-level transition system. For example, an arithmetic operation may expand into a sequence of bit operations. - A BDD-based algorithm for the symbolic exploration of multi-level hierarchies of transition systems. The algorithm traverses a level-n transition by expanding the corresponding level-(n - 1) transition system on-the-fly. The level-n successors of a state are determined by computing a level-(n - 1) reach set, which is then immediately released from memory. In this fashion, we can exhaustively explore hierarchically structured state spaces whose flat counterparts cause memory overflows. - We experimentally demonstrate the efficiency of our method with three examples-a multiplier, a cache coherence protocol, and a multiprocessor system. In the first two examples, we obtain significant improvements in run times and peak BDD sizes over traditional state-space search. The third example cannot be model checked at all using conventional methods (without manual abstractions), but can be analyzed fully automatically using transition hierarchies.", "authors": ["Rajeev Alur", "Thomas A.

{"abstract": "Misclassification of bug reports inevitably sacrifices the performance of bug prediction models. Manual examinations can help reduce the noise but bring a heavy burden for developers instead. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach by combining both text mining and data mining techniques of bug report data to automate the prediction process. The first stage leverages text mining techniques to analyze the summary parts of bug reports and classifies them into three levels of probability. The extracted features and some other structured features of bug reports are then fed into the machine learner in the second stage. Data grafting techniques are employed to bridge the two stages. Comparative experiments with previous studies on the same data -- three large-scale open source projects -- consistently achieve a reasonable enhancement (from 77.4% to 81.7%, 73.9% to 80.2% and 87.4% to 93.7%, respectively) over their best results in terms of overall performance.

{"abstract": "This paper addresses the problem of detecting and segmenting partially occluded objects of a known category. We first define a part labelling which densely covers the object. Our Layout Consistent Random Field (LayoutCRF) model then imposes asymmetric local spatial constraints on these labels to ensure the consistent layout of parts whilst allowing for object deformation. Arbitrary occlusions of the object are handled by avoiding the assumption that the whole object is visible. The resulting system is both efficient to train and to apply to novel images, due to a novel annealed layout-consistent expansion move algorithm paired with a randomised decision tree classifier. We apply our technique to images of cars and faces and demonstrate state-of-the-art detection and segmentation performance even in the presence of partial occlusion.", "authors": ["John Winn", "Jamie Shotton"], "n_citation": 313, "references": ["0f91a8da-f46b-4a48-87f1-b0fb12c53451", "1317365d-c46d-4c09-8261-9d07404e4908", "3c49df6f-3b50-450f-aa93-4c715cfd05af", "5d7a9371-b15a-4635-b92b-46a8a31c214c", "5f70f18c-5f9c-442e-ae2c-ee6aadecab95", "7729fafc-7053-4dd8-ac08-78232e0f2a74", "81f384cb-72e0-4e86-8df2-582b17864c6e", "ae829318-5d10-461d-9c99-34a95a3f8732", "ba001118-fb92-48d0-9f09-e618fda3fbb6", "bb38f1ba-9459-443f-a289-49ffd4277f7f", "c455fb04-4566-4648-ad6f-3cf2245e507c", "cc1f3cc4-de91-41a2-9c01-d5af6598a53d", "d4d98193-fa86-445e-a140-959c646323a7", "d7b1fba1-b5f8-4377-88a8-d2fc69f723b7"], "title": "The Layout Consistent Random Field for Recognizing and Segmenting Partially Occluded Objects", "venue": "computer vision and pattern recognition", "year": 2006, "id": "b93db877-78b5-4f53-9f99-058795ebb9b5"}
{"abstract": "This paper describes a general approach to constructing cooperative services that span multiple administrative domains. In such environments, protocols must tolerate both  Byzantine behaviors  when broken, misconfigured, or malicious nodes arbitrarily deviate from their specification and  rational behaviors  when selfish nodes deviate from their specification to increase their local benefit. The paper makes three contributions: (1) It introduces the BAR (Byzantine, Altruistic, Rational) model as a foundation for reasoning about cooperative services; (2) It proposes a general three-level architecture to reduce the complexity of building services under the BAR model; and (3) It describes an implementation of BAR-B the first cooperative backup service to tolerate both Byzantine users and an unbounded number of rational users. At the core of BAR-B is an asynchronous replicated state machine that provides the customary safety and liveness guarantees despite nodes exhibiting both Byzantine and rational behaviors. Our prototype provides acceptable performance for our application: our BAR-tolerant state machine executes 15 requests per second, and our BAR-B backup service can back up 100MB of data in under 4 minutes.", "authors": ["Amitanand S.

{"abstract": "A new type of artificial neural network is used to identify different crops and ground elements from hyperspectral remote sensing data sets. These networks incorporate Gaussian synapses and are trained using a specific algorithm called Gaussian synapse back propagation described here. Gaussian synapses present an intrinsic filtering ability that permit concentrating on what is relevant in the spectra and automatically discard what is not. The networks are structurally adapted to the problem complexity as superfluous synapses and/or nodes are implicitly eliminated by the training procedure, thus pruning the network to the required size straight from the training set. The fundamental difference between the present proposal and other ANN topologies using Gaussian functions is that the latter use these functions as activation functions in the nodes, while in our case, they are used as synaptic elements, allowing them to be easily shaped during the training process to produce any type of n-dimensional discriminator. This paper proposes a multi- and hyperspectral image segmenter that results from the parallel and concurrent application of several of these networks providing a probability vector that is processed by a decision module. Depending on the criteria used for the decision module, different perspectives of the same image may be obtained. The resulting structure offers the possibility of resolving mixtures, that is, carrying out a spectral unmixing process in a very straightforward manner.", "authors": ["Juan Lui\u0301s Crespo", "Richard J.

{"abstract": "Data Grid is a geographically distributed environment that deals with large-scale data-intensive applications. Effective scheduling in Grid can reduce the amount of data transferred among nodes by submitting a job to a node, where most of the requested data files are available. Data replication is another key optimization technique for reducing access latency and managing large data by storing data in a wisely manner. In this paper two algorithms are proposed, first a novel job scheduling algorithm called Combined Scheduling Strategy (CSS) that uses hierarchical scheduling to reduce the search time for an appropriate computing node. It considers the number of jobs waiting in queue, the location of required data for the job and the computing capacity of sites. Second a dynamic data replication strategy, called the Modified Dynamic Hierarchical Replication Algorithm (MDHRA) that improves file access time. This strategy is an enhanced version of Dynamic Hierarchical Replication (DHR) strategy. Data replication should be used wisely because the storage capacity of each Grid site is limited. Thus, it is important to design an effective strategy for the replication replacement. MDHRA replaces replicas based on the last time the replica was requested, number of access, and size of replica. It selects the best replica location from among the many replicas based on response time that can be determined by considering the data transfer time, the storage access latency, the replica requests that waiting in the storage queue and the distance between nodes. The simulation results demonstrate the proposed replication and scheduling strategies give better performance compared to the other algorithms.", "authors": ["Najme Mansouri", "Gholam Hosein Dastghaibyfard", "Ehsan Mansouri"], "n_citation": 19, "references": ["01c71526-af55-493b-a72c-ac6b6b991292", "062a7a89-150c-4569-80d8-8c5fd8d94d38", "07ccb294-c9d7-43ab-9e0a-28a6881a1811", "0bf830b5-f80b-447c-ae3a-2247fe496794", "14e6b455-b336-4327-9a7a-0ba0951608d4", "1de75565-16f2-485f-b4d5-e3597658a5e7", "2d0d6273-446b-482b-9237-2b297d6492bd", "3787628f-001d-4225-91b4-c28a7a54ca6d", "3892bbd7-6185-4817-8448-61e0e9db007f", "5961cc93-c550-490c-a3e1-91e9958984c8", "656b1581-31e0-415a-9020-f7fc3a6e9754", "66741402-e087-4b60-9b22-0351fb7f72c8", "6a48c57b-f099-425b-9196-a5224a658223", "73dddb4d-b6d9-49e3-a075-d7aac3a20d62", "8b36de82-4314-4c49-b132-beccd31564a7", "9c18f22a-4eef-4e92-8ed0-4ecfefe8185e", "ca0739c1-8cda-4703-9852-209024c66b22", "d758f3e9-46c5-41d1-9ffe-3db204984ce0", "e4caf379-843a-4556-bd66-b17db13a0015", "e5daf085-46ea-4399-b802-f2b7b92c783b", "eca73efc-5cbb-46af-8ada-703840ceb142", "f3e932fb-1516-48da-aeb5-147da79447dc", "fa6be0f5-60a2-4424-84f7-3b05772c0f2f", "fbde4e1d-84e6-47fa-83fe-945e0b893c95"], "title": "Combination of data replication and scheduling algorithm for improving data availability in Data Grids", "venue": "Journal of Network and Computer Applications", "year": 2013, "id": "6a92de4a-339f-4a3c-82a2-73943152c8b0"}

Furthermore, this contribution tries to show how the users' behaviour can be learnt in a case-based fashion and how the users' way of thinking can be simulated.", "authors": ["Andreas Zimmermann"], "n_citation": 52, "references": ["220698b7-f035-4a84-87b7-1fd9d0e43c3f", "44e91111-b413-4143-85a9-81872a97fa9d", "4c28d298-c4f5-426c-87be-83f44316cc0b", "5979404b-9fe6-4751-8c37-554944797853", "5d274fdc-f3fa-455e-81c2-964714fc61ea", "5ee83a3b-d5f8-4532-97dd-c0579bed0d17", "8ca1fc15-957a-4b80-9988-3c8cae85a4f6", "954cac13-7a69-4b56-85f8-dcccc10575c9", "9ae0142d-b12f-42b1-ac48-d655fdec233f", "bf6da814-c449-4667-9a59-261608a45478", "cba9b077-58db-4531-b7d3-c4491bdf897e", "d4d644c4-8503-4583-b177-ddcf2a786592", "d7825e13-b803-413c-924c-7aea5e2a1159", "dbe5ae2e-bbc0-4508-8df5-3ec95c784fa8", "de8e60ab-025a-49af-9441-1f796cd0444c"], "title": "Context-awareness in user modelling: requirements analysis for a case-based reasoning application", "venue": "international conference on case-based reasoning", "year": 2003, "id": "7dd902fe-1e5d-4fe3-afc5-6a7496beb5fc"}

The method applies to systems whose structures (i.e., state transition graphs) have more state symmetries than arc symmetries. We introduce a new notion of \"virtual symmetry\" that strictly subsumes earlier notions of \"rough symmetry\" and \"near symmetry\" (Emerson and Trefler, 1999). Virtual symmetry is the most general condition under which the structure of a system is naturally bisimilar to its quotient by a group of state symmetries. We give several example systems exhibiting virtual symmetry that are not amenable to symmetry reduction by earlier techniques: a one-lane bridge system, where the direction with priority for crossing changes dynamically; an abstract system with asymmetric communication network; and a system with asymmetric resource sharing motivated from the drinking philosophers problem. These examples show that virtual symmetry reduction applies to a significantly broader class of asymmetric systems than could be handled before.", "authors": ["E.A. Emerson", "John W.

{"abstract": "The power of butterfly-like networks as multicomputer interconnection networks is studied, by considering how efficiently the butterfly can emulate other networks. Emulations are studied formally via graph embeddings, so the topic here becomes : How efficiently can one embed the graph underlying a given interconnection network in the graph underlying the butterfly network ? Within this framework, the slowdown incurred by an emulation is measured by the sum of the dilation and the congestion of the corresponding embedding (respectively, the maximum amount that the embedding stretches an edge of the guest graph, and the maximum traffic across any edge of the host graph) ; the efficiency of resource utilization in an emulation is measured by the expansion of the corresponding embedding (the ratio of the sizes of the host to guest graph). Three main results expose a number of optimal emulations by butterfly networks. Call a family of graphs balanced if complete binary trees can be embedded in the family with simultaneous dilation, congestion, and expansion 0(1). (1) The family of butterfly graphs is balanced. (2) (a) Any graph < from a family of maxdegree-d graphs having a recursive separator of size S(x) can be embedded in any balanced graph family with simultaneous dilation O(log(d \u03a3 i  S(2 -i |G|))) and expansion O(1). (b) Any dilation-D embedding of a maxdegree-d graph in a butterfly graph can be converted to an embedding having simultaneous dilation O(D) and congestion O(dD). (3) Any embedding of a planar graph G in a butterfly graph must have dilation \u03a9(log \u03a3 (G)/\u03a6(G), where : \u03a3(G) is the size of the smallest (1/3, 2/3)-node-separator of G, and \u03a6(G) is the size of G's largest interior face. Applications of these results include : (1) The n-node X-tree network can be emulated by the butterfly network with slowdown O(log log n) and expansion 0(1) ; no embedding has dilation smaller than \u03a9(log log n), independent of expansion. (2) Every embedding of the n x n mesh in the butterfly graph has dilation \u03a9(log n) ; any expansion-O(1) embedding in the butterfly graph achieves dilation O(log n). These applications provide the first examples of networks that can be embedded more efficiently in hypercubes than in butterflies. We also show that analogues of these results hold for networks that are structurally related to the butterfly network. The upper bounds hold for the hypercube and the de Bruijn networks, possibly with altered constants. The lower bounds hold-at least in weakened form-for the de Bruijn network.", "authors": ["Sandeep N. Bhatt", "Fan R. K. Chung", "J. M. Hong", "F. Thomson Leighton", "Bojana Obrenic", "Arnold L.

{"abstract": "This paper introduces  dynamic impact analysis  as a cost-effective technique to enforce the error-propagation condition for detecting a fault. The intuition behind dynamic impact analysis is as follows. In a specific test-case, if an execution of a syntactic component has a  strong impact  on the program output and if the output is correct, then the value of that component-execution is not likely to be erroneous. To capture this intuition in a theoretical framework the notion of  impact  is formally defined and the concept of  impact strength  is proposed as a quantitative measure of the impact. In order to provide an infrastructure supporting the computation of impact strengths, program impact graphs and execution impact  graphs are introduced. An empirical study validating the computation of impact strengths is presented. It is shown that the impact strengths computed by dynamic impact analysis provide reasonable estimates for the error-sensitivity with respect to the output except when the impact is via one or more error-tolerant components of the program. Potential applications of dynamic impact analysis in the area of mutation testing and dynamic program slicing are discussed.", "authors": ["Tarak Goradia"], "n_citation": 52, "references": ["20dd194a-73d3-4b90-9fd9-368d90021c5f", "283f6d3e-0243-45f8-a737-0299486b9eed", "2b47a5ec-fd51-4b53-bd29-f6fc5e44da8a", "30505a63-6a9b-4614-aacf-5d7531eca52e", "89d4d0d1-abed-485d-947b-54f854f59348", "a7122806-c66c-49e6-8876-70093d70f605", "cf752ca1-6232-4a5d-8fda-7dd7cb70e405", "d70fb3e4-1e5f-4ab3-900d-34ecb9efc841"], "title": "Dynamic impact analysis: a cost-effective technique to enforce error-propagation", "venue": "international symposium on software testing and analysis", "year": 1993, "id": "aed3437d-e3e6-4b22-bda0-aece11511359"}
{"abstract": "Our goal is to develop a formal method for analogically deriving programs from past programming experience. It is commonly recognized that program development plays a central role in analogical programming. This paper proposes to use a calculus to uniformly represent specification, program, and the development from the former to the latter. Thus analogical reasoning can be discussed in a single framework. In this framework, we first propose an analogy matching method to seek the analogical correspondence between two specifications based on a generalization procedure. Secondly, the analogical correspondence is used as a basis for transforming existing program derivations to new ones. The corresponding program can be obtained by simple calculation of its type. Finally, an example is given to illustrate our method", "authors": ["Jianguo Lu", "Jiafu Xu"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["14c252ca-1a7f-4faf-abab-1a2e807e34b6", "1ed18b3b-f08d-47f1-b41a-e1be5488bc3a", "330a4910-d46e-4857-9745-2dc4fba6b37b", "65e3abdb-1dd8-4014-b6f8-301f28db958f", "6c5aa4ae-a495-485e-886c-8e93ca17ce02", "73e7debb-b80e-4332-b3b2-eddea02596a7", "78caf0c7-e326-43e4-b241-8ee12a788588", "bac53490-5ee1-4c74-ac65-0ce745c69516", "cdd457e5-2be5-466e-812a-7748eba098af", "e31c1800-6fda-4750-a3f9-0b6be604da58", "f802a438-440c-4927-a2df-e5145d45355d"], "title": "Analogical program derivation based on type theory", "venue": "Theoretical Computer Science", "year": 1993, "id": "97037ec1-caeb-47ed-8bad-7ee6cb449b75"}
{"abstract": "While user access control and encryption can protect valuable data from passive observers, those techniques leave visible ciphertexts that are likely to alert an active adversary to the existence of the data, who can then compel an authorized user to disclose it. We introduce StegFS, a steganographic file system that aims to overcome that weakness by offering plausible deniability to owners of protected files. StegFS securely hides user-selected files in a file system so that, without the corresponding access keys, an attacker would not be able to deduce their existence, even if the attacker is thoroughly familiar with the implementation of the file system and has gained full access to it. Unlike previous steganographic schemes, our construction satisfies the prerequisites of a practical file system in ensuring integrity of the files and maintaining efficient space utilization. We have completed an implementation on Linux, and experiment results confirm that StegFS achieves an order of magnitude improvements in performance and/or space utilization over the existing schemes.", "authors": ["Hwee Hwa Pang", "Kian-Lee Tan", "Xuan Zhou"], "n_citation": 66, "references": ["0ab8c0f9-fdba-428d-81a3-da79d759598e", "20a11d00-6b61-4632-9238-8f815a88077d", "851aac9e-8417-4f58-ae39-ac564ec7c5c4", "9014d656-f516-45a8-a4ed-c1f02d5f4208", "b6321248-6b5a-494d-91bc-411c0a4f20c2", "b90c5640-8e10-4f65-9193-c28af80f45e2", "baecf0e7-156e-4d5b-a0e5-aa95a884201e", "d34f6a76-a17f-4246-a54a-c6004d138501"], "title": "StegFS: a steganographic file system", "venue": "international conference on data engineering", "year": 2003, "id": "32881fb1-3658-4787-a76f-7489c83d3b4e"}
{"abstract": "Fault injection is traditionally divided into simulation-based and physical techniques depending on whether faults are injected into hardware models, or into an actual physical system or prototype. Another classification is based on how fault injection mechanisms are implemented. Well known techniques are hardware-implemented fault injection (HIFI) and softwareimplemented fault injection (SWIFI). For safety analyses during model-based development, fault injection mechanisms can be added directly into models of hardware, models of software or models of systems. This approach is denoted by the authors as model-implemented fault injection. This paper presents the MODIFI (MODel-Implemented Fault Injection) tool. The tool is currently targeting behaviour models in Simulink. Fault models used by MODIFI are defined using XML according to a specific schema file and the fault injection algorithm uses the concept of minimal cut sets (MCS) generation. First, a user defined set of single faults are injected to see if the system is tolerant against single faults. Single faults leading to a failure, i.e. a safety requirement violation, are stored in a MCS list together with the corresponding counterexample. These faults are also removed from the fault space used for subsequent experiments. When all single faults have been injected, the effects of multiple faults are investigated, i.e. two or more faults are introduced at the same time. The complete list of MCS is finally used to automatically generate test cases for efficient fault injection on the target system.", "authors": ["Rickard Svenningsson", "Jonny Vinter", "Henrik Eriksson", "Martin T\u00f6rngren"], "n_citation": 47, "references": ["09a013d2-19ad-497d-894a-d2f9e1d18b1d", "09c27f8a-5ec2-48d9-8394-c4aae5e75165", "28ba2757-d078-44fb-8ac6-02065089ab87", "51c24d12-4dbf-4c36-b4cd-fde84200e1fe", "5454c4d3-5607-45cc-a167-918e469a10e8", "62f3104c-7c1d-4c5f-88ae-3d7209cbcd85", "6bcf6b13-313d-42e4-b828-bed920213550", "845ef51e-20e7-430e-9f4b-3e47e97ae778", "85729a47-f15c-43df-ae11-de5449fc26bd", "a992c772-547f-4ef5-ae9a-2a975ec08f05", "ae037804-5fac-4d30-95ad-8d0f560019ec", "b9ccfd0e-c4d2-4591-8354-83c38673ff42", "c5b89dcd-5196-42f5-a2ff-89f491a7c059", "e98b6b52-8940-49c6-bdcd-03ad75aeae5b"], "title": "MODIFI: a MODel-implemented fault injection tool", "venue": "international conference on computer safety reliability and security", "year": 2010, "id": "eece0cce-b316-41f6-b3df-d395c5fb933a"}

The purpose of this article is to survey the related activities from database people\u2019s view and stimulate the interests among the database community. It covers three aspects. First, the efforts that apply established database techniques to retrieving Web information are summarized. These efforts aim to overcome the inadequacy of file system technology on which the Web is based, so that information can be retrieved easily and quickly from the Web. Second, various approaches to interfacing databases via the Web are discussed, with examples of accomplished prototypes and commercial products showing recent advances. Finally, some possible extensions to the traditional database techniques are investigated for building fully fledged Web-based database applications.", "authors": ["Hongjun Lu", "Ling Feng"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["14547da9-32bf-4a85-b72e-3894a9323f0f", "38a47ca0-4551-4b90-afbd-4b2a644d114a", "3c1e5671-68b2-4b0a-8969-924b171a6623", "3f00f5e4-42c3-4cca-9ee5-44312a55c6d3", "4a9e46d9-9858-41e8-9e73-c759542f14e8", "60593dd9-d753-44ec-b03f-7932941a3b8d", "699f58b4-0b69-4574-9de7-33ca0e454d61", "71d5fd37-a670-4ba5-8430-6ce1301b29f7", "a1d900a3-21b1-4d26-8701-626e9fcf06d8", "b297a5f3-7b79-431c-8ba5-9f1e870955ca", "b6b071c3-d011-4c8d-aa0b-54c5ee421795", "cd103946-a705-497f-9606-669ebc151f32", "d02f6aca-a2fe-46e2-a1f5-9e987531e5de", "e2d9101a-e6ab-42bb-a389-5df84ac58063", "e9cc3f71-7efe-4602-8697-d7bab2f8ec68"], "title": "Integrating database and World Wide Web technologies", "venue": "international world wide web conferences", "year": 1998, "id": "bb289584-8546-4e56-bbc5-d1da70d8513e"}
{"abstract": "In a wide band and multipath rich environment, precise channel estimation allows authenticating the source and protecting the integrity of a message at the physical layer without the need of a pre-shared secret key. This allows also a reduction of the burden on the authentication protocols at higher layers. In this paper we develop an authentication scheme in the framework of hypothesis testing that suits a multiple wiretap channels environment with correlated fading, as is the case of multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems and/or orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. By allowing some degree of correlation among the channels, we formulate the optimal attack strategy for the cases of both single attempt and multiple repeated trials. For the latter scenario, due to the complexity of the optimal solution, we also develop a simpler suboptimal attack strategy. The performance of the proposed methods is evaluated in a MIMO/OFDM scenario and numerical results show the merits of the proposed approaches that can be adopted as a layer one authentication mechanism.", "authors": ["Paolo Baracca", "Nicola Laurenti", "Stefano Tomasin"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["1a07fe7c-6820-4a54-8851-20d6c1e7d2ef", "1a9ebe93-a1d1-44f1-987b-d1b6047bf2ae", "52165f68-d077-4885-aae7-09284f172e2f", "68d7622a-f000-4763-8dc2-0fbd2a671781", "8debbb74-9c55-4934-bfbc-1f4ca3a6f09a", "9c42be60-9bfd-432f-a90b-a8727643da7e", "b3f3c57f-e0e2-40f7-91d1-151317b205b4", "b6772fe4-1449-4752-92b5-a656a5f619e6", "b97daa66-1fb7-4042-abd3-1b2be03f15b2", "c1be76cf-0e05-4b7a-96c5-fb5c15d832ce", "c9444290-f04a-4e4c-97af-f61fbcc80fa4", "cba6735e-59bf-40bd-bae8-33dc48d9492c", "e84ed2c8-71f3-4d3b-ae90-c0fde5ddf1e6", "f5687dde-824f-4cd0-a833-3bdc833bfc36"], "title": "Physical Layer Authentication over MIMO Fading Wiretap Channels", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Wireless Communications", "year": 2012, "id": "b5dafbc9-f7bb-40ed-8134-acc567d6c798"}
{"abstract": "In this paper we propose a new approach to web visualisation with VRML based on a function-based shape modelling, which unifies different types of mathematical functions in order to enrich the existing web visualisation techniques for modelling. In our method, parametric, implicit and explicit functions can be used concurrently for defining geometry, colour, texture, and other properties of shapes. Geometric shapes and their properties are defined by functions in their respective domains and then merged into function-defined objects. The proposed framework allows for its extending with any function-based model. To illustrate our method and to prove its feasibility, we implemented it for web visualisation as the Function-based Extension of Virtual Reality Modelling Language. In this implementation, parametric implicit and explicit analytical formulae are used for defining geometry and appearance of three-dimensional (3D) shapes. The function-based extension of VRML is used for collaborative shape modelling as well as for building shared virtual worlds.", "authors": ["Q.

This WWW shell it is claimed is particularly adapted to the development of collaborative applications. This paper challenges this claim on three grounds: browser incompatibilities limit the potential benefits from client-side processing technologies; the generic Common Gateway Interface as an application delivery mechanism is inadequate and the networking restrictions on Java applets constrain effective use of the latter as dedicated interfaces to remote applications. This argument is illustrated with respect to three case studies of practical collaborative applications of WWW shell technology.

{"abstract": "We consider the problem of learning good trajectories for manipulation tasks. This is challenging because the criterion defining a good trajectory varies with users, tasks and environments. In this paper, we propose a co-active online learning framework for teaching robots the preferences of its users for object manipulation tasks. The key novelty of our approach lies in the type of feedback expected from the user: the human user does not need to demonstrate optimal trajectories as training data, but merely needs to iteratively provide trajectories that slightly improve over the trajectory currently proposed by the system. We argue that this co-active preference feedback can be more easily elicited from the user than demonstrations of optimal trajectories, which are often challenging and non-intuitive to provide on high degrees of freedom manipulators. Nevertheless, theoretical regret bounds of our algorithm match the asymptotic rates of optimal trajectory algorithms. We demonstrate the generalizability of our algorithm on a variety of grocery checkout tasks, for whom, the preferences were not only influenced by the object being manipulated but also by the surrounding environment.1", "authors": ["Ashesh Jain", "Brian Wojcik", "Thorsten Joachims", "Ashutosh Saxena"], "n_citation": 78, "references": ["0aa0d040-1a91-4602-84fb-09b8e795ae82", "0e5d0114-3252-4f99-ac62-7630e51c5955", "0f767179-a5a6-4833-badb-eef942b067c6", "15572841-b1ac-4357-88cf-88294d432a4b", "1739c7fc-898c-41ce-8ac9-c2fc086924ff", "208cb1e1-ba3f-4f12-9e85-60e60a4a89df", "23a5428a-8df9-450b-a7bc-e1cff7c92937", "23c05168-94ea-438a-b97a-15b821515d32", "2bab8126-3179-4ba6-8bba-fe48772f993a", "32a346a1-cc20-4e51-951e-879a01160753", "378fe655-0c9c-45fa-b340-537950efaa3e", "437f73b0-d0f2-4024-97eb-68a67057da32", "4659c0c2-c02d-4cf7-9a5b-980accd4ca3f", "4773f1f0-89a2-4cd1-849a-6f2925f0cccb", "4b05d3f9-58ac-47cf-ba5f-6358721b7d87", "5ec55c94-93e4-4235-b6cf-debba13728a1", "6392bfb4-6a10-4298-b725-f27dd4920f14", "63e4d154-e731-4474-9e06-5f1409f89a8f", "65d5c7ad-2756-4dee-af25-5a6c1f6f1fe7", "68453f24-4276-4d0c-b37e-19d23af549be", "695e2b19-fab5-46d2-b4b7-95cd722f0d7c", "6bde2ae5-8732-470a-9a84-7745b4eaa982", "6c3869e8-4aa9-43f4-bfbc-667e4ca3a58a", "6decb5ac-a552-4e1e-b9eb-87bd58a2dea5", "6e6b90a6-22ff-4716-8967-cade44d3bd2d", "81d2c7b7-50ad-4edf-bcd0-8ff11643b397", "834f73f1-7468-499e-bbf6-67810694bcc8", "8bfb1563-5f31-4127-a98c-8d36c630fce8", "96f1c1a8-db07-4406-bf98-baa7e120f059", "98986537-a653-4b30-a088-23b160ba1ebb", "9fba897d-57de-4664-85f2-1f9679884344", "a052f447-7fec-417a-822c-14b768c8b4d6", "a0c33b78-5a0f-4823-bb25-ffc94c77cb53", "a0f38893-fe75-439a-bf59-a4c245c5b1e6", "a5f2d69b-2ff6-4afc-ac3b-b5712adc7bc6", "af4b69fd-bfb1-4909-a0c0-07e5b0bf7849", "b75fab03-6495-4f91-948f-b5beb6d93b6d", "c2b82656-f308-43bd-92cb-853062f14b89", "c7736266-f9bc-4941-9a70-5b2199ebac30", "cf557641-4fe0-404c-9c42-f57354d53283", "db534776-2a70-41a5-b7b4-1f03ede5abac", "df6629a1-d6db-4b08-b835-698b731cd574", "f6a53d5a-cc0a-4193-a576-b1741447b539", "f8c895cd-13d9-4ad4-a6a3-46265baa5371"], "title": "Learning Trajectory Preferences for Manipulators via Iterative Improvement", "venue": "neural information processing systems", "year": 2013, "id": "5dc97c5e-d832-438a-8fe4-8f6d9c1ca0dd"}
{"abstract": "The community structure of complex networks reveals both their organization and hidden relationships among their constituents. Most community detection methods currently available are not deterministic, and their results typically depend on the specific random seeds, initial conditions and tie-break rules adopted for their execution. Consensus clustering is used in data analysis to generate stable results out of a set of partitions delivered by stochastic methods. Here we show that consensus clustering can be combined with any existing method in a self-consistent way, enhancing considerably both the stability and the accuracy of the resulting partitions. This framework is also particularly suitable to monitor the evolution of community structure in temporal networks. An application of consensus clustering to a large citation network of physics papers demonstrates its capability to keep track of the birth, death and diversification of topics.", "authors": ["Andrea Lancichinetti", "Santo Fortunato"], "n_citation": 196, "references": ["06dc0648-62ce-4357-8fb5-9d0dbd83faed", "0d38b60f-2002-46e9-b726-ccb995eed3fb", "24065196-bfc0-44b2-998c-4f3c4b5027b4", "26cd1d0d-331d-499a-8d35-a501e6af9200", "41ef14ab-1903-42f1-98e6-878158cf87f4", "5b9802ac-5450-4c43-a076-5a9735136ae1", "60ef3852-fa16-44bf-9434-9909268ba5d8", "68faab18-b537-4f62-85cf-ddc9ef352362", "75830a91-6bd3-47b9-a517-5e1e0b68bf04", "9b24620b-c850-4fd3-91e8-e6acdc51aac9", "b0ef6e4d-4c86-4b10-9e0a-7b630ca8d7f7", "b6c8bcad-70a8-4d76-82f7-109c0439a645", "ed1a3c2d-45ad-4828-a2b1-9e844c540188", "ff39b7e1-80a3-47bb-8c18-a0e0257ddf60"], "title": "Consensus clustering in complex networks", "venue": "Scientific Reports", "year": 2012, "id": "cfddc7bc-037c-4914-bf17-2efb24a25246"}
{"abstract": "This paper presents an example-based method for calculating skeleton-driven body deformations. Our example data consists of range scans of a human body in a variety of poses. Using markers captured during range scanning, we construct a kinematic skeleton and identify the pose of each scan. We then construct a mutually consistent parameterization of all the scans using a posable subdivision surface template. The detail deformations are represented as displacements from this surface, and holes are filled smoothly within the displacement maps. Finally, we combine the range scans using  k -nearest neighbor interpolation in pose space. We demonstrate results for a human upper body with controllable pose, kinematics, and underlying surface shape.", "authors": ["Brett Allen", "Brian Curless", "Zoran Popovi\u0107"], "n_citation": 363, "references": ["1d1e1537-8889-4aa3-9e21-35bebdbf0521", "3b0f81cc-1648-4536-88b5-9b67e32ae0ba", "3bde8473-296e-40fd-bbe3-010e2108187a", "455ea429-ceb9-4791-ae11-3b95f555bb22", "4892eac6-0bca-4c0e-b519-011327275ba3", "50b1abc6-dedb-4f55-978b-396b2e7a62c4", "590476dc-e34f-4e1b-ba3c-e83a17773cae", "7f8f64cd-6b8e-4254-ae50-4db2dcf12f5b", "862b36dc-5404-4986-b294-3f0ad9b736c0", "9e33c655-8bd8-40ce-a32d-f4a2d1335bd1", "b817349e-bda1-4fe9-a1cd-39b8662d9f5f", "bbc80ce2-554b-4e12-8a39-7ad1e57c3c6b", "bcfeac7d-9007-41e0-b12d-d734fa7ea858", "c46fec48-56c2-4ef1-afca-39bb5e3416cb", "c56e8155-8636-4c28-9b6d-a879582c63fa", "ce94a72a-fbd0-4829-9dc7-08e0c9f3ca8d", "d565727e-50e4-445f-9c84-e774cfca9e4e", "de076976-039c-4f3b-9638-90254632d887", "dfdcec9e-446d-4506-80f7-22d7e7299107", "e61b9dd4-bc17-4f5a-a5b3-a6f5e480dd8e"], "title": "Articulated body deformation from range scan data", "venue": "international conference on computer graphics and interactive techniques", "year": 2002, "id": "3aeb8a31-3cca-43b3-956e-f93beddf3dca"}

{"abstract": "It is shown in this paper that the problem of deciding if a test suite generated from a finite state machine provides complete fault coverage can be converted into the problem of minimizing the test tree representing the test suite. A fault coverage analysis procedure, capable of deciding if a given test suite provides complete fault coverage in respect to a given FSM specification, is then developed. The core of this procedure is a state minimization procedure developed specifically for the class of FSMs whose graphic representations are trees. The fault coverage analysis procedure can cope with partially specified FSM specifications which need not be reduced and faults that increase the number of states up to a chosen upper bound. Two necessary and one sufficient conditions, which in some cases may simplify the fault coverage analysis, are also presented. >", "authors": ["Ming Yu Yao", "Alexandre Petrenko", "Gregor von Bochmann"], "n_citation": 25, "references": ["05b422f4-5e75-4127-8595-f2b129a6f677", "099ab808-c88e-47eb-98ba-57be5e6a12da", "1208b089-b3f1-486e-a9cb-77538069060a", "2dc1a039-ebcb-4b3c-9d1d-d52b7b7e3432", "57fabc5e-7975-483a-a89b-8568b371450d", "5d8d4c0d-97fb-45f3-ae22-c64d54409e52", "9b44463f-1c78-4498-9b50-c8a97e37287f", "a7340a8a-43be-430c-bee6-15290b7244b8", "bd5036cd-e4f2-422e-b207-d9948aef1e50", "c110d9e5-ecdc-45e4-9266-2250e25a5cd0", "e1ab1251-988f-474c-9036-debda2c79185", "e5516570-89fe-4974-8162-a59fa4bf7cd1"], "title": "Fault coverage analysis in respect to an FSM specification", "venue": "international conference on computer communications", "year": 1994, "id": "1056fb71-f261-4df9-867e-9e38e726ff6c"}

{"abstract": "Silicon compilers are often used in conjunction with Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) to deliver flexibility, fast prototyping, and accelerated time-to-market. Many of these compilers produce hardware that is larger than necessary, as they do not allow instructions to share hardware resources. This study presents an efficient heuristic which transforms a set of custom instructions into a single hardware datapath on which they can execute. Our approach is based on the classic problems of finding the longest common subsequence and substring of two (or more) sequences. This heuristic produces circuits which are as much as 85.33% smaller than those synthesized by integer linear programming (ILP) approaches which do not explore resource sharing. On average, we obtained 55.41% area reduction for pipelined datapaths, and 66.92% area reduction for VLIW datapaths.

{"abstract": "Within the many-valued approach for approximate reasoning, the aim of this paper is two-fold. First, to extend truth-values lattices to cope with the imprecision due to possible incompleteness of the available information. This is done by considering two bilattices of truth-value intervals corresponding to the so-called weak and strong truth orderings. Based on the use of interval bilattices, the second aim is to introduce what we call partial many-valued logics. The (partial) models of such logics may assign intervals of truth-values to formulas, and so they stand for representations of incomplete states of knowledge. Finally, the relation between partial and complete semantical entailment is studied, and it is provedtheir equivalence for a family of formulas, including the so-called free well formed formulas.", "authors": ["Francesc Esteva", "Pere Garcia-Calv\u00e9s", "Llu\u00eds Godo"], "n_citation": 15, "title": "ENRICHED INTERVAL BILATTICES AND PARTIAL MANY-VALUED LOGICS: AN APPROACH TO DEAL WITH GRADED TRUTH AND IMPRECISION", "venue": "International Journal of Uncertainty, Fuzziness and Knowledge-Based Systems", "year": 1994, "id": "2169d23a-8018-44dc-ade4-399a50db0a40"}

{"abstract": "Many software applications today need to handle data from different data models; typically objects from the host programming language along with the relational and XML data models. The ROX impedance mismatch makes programs awkward to write and hard to maintain.The .NET Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) framework, proposed for the next release of the .NET framework, approaches this problem by defining a pattern of general-purpose standard query operators for traversal, filter, and projection. Based on this pattern, any .NET language can define special query comprehension syntax that is subsequently compiled into these standard operators (our code examples are in VB).Besides the general query operators, the LINQ framework also defines two domain specific APIs that work over XML (XLinq) and relational data (DLinq) respectively. The operators over XML use a lightweight and easy to use in-memory XML representation to provide XQuery-style expressiveness in the host programming language. The operators over relational data provide a simple OR mapping by leveraging remotable queries that are executed directly in the back-end relational store.", "authors": ["Erik Meijer", "Brian Beckman", "Gavin M.

{"abstract": "In this paper, we investigate optimal load balancing strategies for a multi-class multi-server processor-sharing system with a Poisson input stream, heterogeneous service rates, and a server-dependent holding cost per unit time. Specifically, we study (i) the centralized setting in which a dispatcher routes incoming jobs based on their service time requirements so as to minimize the weighted mean sojourn time in the system; and (ii) the decentralized, distributed non-cooperative setting in which each job, aware of its service time, selects a server with the objective of minimizing its weighted mean sojourn time in the system. For the decentralized setting we show the existence of a potential function, which allows us to transform the non-cooperative game into a standard convex optimization problem.#R##N##R##N#For the two aforementioned settings, we characterize the set of optimal routing policies and obtain a closed form expression for the load on each server under any such policy. Furthermore, we show the existence of an optimal policy that routes a job independently of its service time requirement. We also show that the set of servers used in the decentralized setting is a subset of set of servers used in the centralized setting. Finally, we compare the performance perceived by jobs in the two settings by studying the so-called Price of Anarchy (PoA), that is, the ratio between the decentralized and the optimal centralized solutions. When the holding cost per unit time is the same for all servers, it is known that the PoA is upper bounded by the number of servers in the system. Interestingly, we show that the PoA for our system can be unbounded. In particular this indicates that in our system, the performance of selfish routing can be extremely inefficient.", "authors": ["Eitan Altman", "Urtzi Ayesta", "Balakrishna J.

In the new method called H-PSO, the particles are arranged in a dynamic hierarchy that is used to define a neighborhood structure. Depending on the quality of their so-far best-found solution, the particles move up or down the hierarchy. This gives good particles that move up in the hierarchy a larger influence on the swarm. We introduce a variant of H-PSO, in which the shape of the hierarchy is dynamically adapted during the execution of the algorithm. Another variant is to assign different behavior to the individual particles with respect to their level in the hierarchy.

Specifically, no data needs to be migrated to the new schema, and no special null values are required.

{"abstract": "Trust-based recommendations control the exchange of personal information between handheld computers. Combined with explicit risk analysis, this enables unobtrusive information exchange, while limiting access to confidential information. This is illustrated with applications such as personal address books and electronic diaries. Recommendations associate categories with data and with each other with degrees of trust belief and disbelief. Since categories also in turn confer privileges and restrict actions, they are analogous to roles in a role-based access control system, while principals represent their trust policies in recommendations. Participants first compute their trust in information, by combining their own trust assumptions with others' policies. Actions are then moderated by a risk assessment, which weighs up costs and benefits, including the cost of the user's time, before deciding whether to allow or forbid the information exchange, or ask for help. By unifying trust assessments and access control, participants can take calculated risks to automatically yet safely share their personal information.", "authors": ["Brian Shand", "Nathan Dimmock", "Jean Bacon"], "n_citation": 101, "references": ["0a555378-4691-4942-aef5-5b7a08a8e580", "1882defa-dd11-4407-909c-bd09c2ea56c9", "32652fe5-d20b-4569-95f4-cd1fed1514f4", "a02714ac-d491-4394-9c13-246e606ce309", "b14b0dd4-5e9d-40a1-b49b-5c8d60ed8ae0", "d624ccf2-5e88-41fc-b516-30afd75a3688"], "title": "Trust for ubiquitous, transparent collaboration", "venue": "pervasive computing and communications", "year": 2003, "id": "89e6f3c6-9b00-492f-bf9a-a05de35ef7c7"}
{"abstract": "The design of software that is easy to port or deliberately targeted for multiple platforms is a neglected area of software engineering. A promising solution is to link components and toolkits through XML and reflection. One of the more compelling definitions of software engineering is, the multiperson construction of multiversion software. The popular view of software engineering focuses on the first part of this definition - managing teams to produce a large product. But just as important is the view inherent in the second part of the definition - identifying specific parts of a product so that experts can design them and organizations can mass-produce them free of language and environment dependencies. Component-based software engineering has made tremendous strides toward satisfying both parts of the definition. Through the use of middleware constructed using reflection and controlled through XML specifications, it is possible to give the components in a large software system a high degree of platform and even language independence.

{"abstract": "The rapid growth of new information services and business-oriented applications entails the consideration of quality of service (QoS) in content distribution. This paper investigates the QoS-aware replica placement problems for responsiveness QoS requirements. We consider two classes of service models: replica-aware services and replica-blind services. In replica-aware services, the servers are aware of the locations of replicas and can therefore optimize request routing to improve responsiveness. We show that the QoS-aware placement problem for replica-aware services is NP-complete. Several heuristic algorithms for fast computation of good solutions are proposed and experimentally evaluated. In replica-blind services, the servers are not aware of the locations of replicas or even their existence. As a result, each replica only serves the requests flowing through it under some given routing strategy. We show that there exist polynomial optimal solutions to the QoS-aware placement problem for replica-blind services.

{"abstract": "Code management systems like Concurrent Version System (CVS) can play an important role in supporting coordination in software development, but often at some time removed from original CVS log entries or removed from the informal conversations around the code. The focus of this paper is one team's long term use of a solution where CVS is augmented with a lightweight event notification system, Elvin, and a tickertape tool where CVS messages are displayed and where developers can also chat with one another. Through a statistical analysis of CVS logs, and a qualitative analysis of tickertape logs and interview data, there is evidence of the tool transforming archival log entries into communicative acts and supporting timely interactions. Developers used the close integration of CVS with chat for growing team culture, stimulating focused discussion, supplementing log information, marking phases of work, coordinating and negotiating work, and managing availability and interruptibility.

{"abstract": "Trust can have imperative influences on the use of interorganizational systems (IOSs). Management, sociology and psychology literature distinguish different types of trust and attribute distinctive impacts to these types. However, little is known regarding the influences of different types of trust on IOSs usage. This paper focuses on how trust based on partner competence and trust based on partner openness influence the use of IOS-related resources. Hypotheses are constructed relying on the use of the resource-based view and transaction-cost economics to analyse influences on relationship specificity of four types of IOS-related resources: business processes, human knowledge, organizational domain knowledge and IOS infrastructure. Three case studies are conducted on interorganizational relationships employing IOSs. Competence-trust is found to positively influence the use of human-knowledge resources, resources related to interlinkage of business processes and organizational domain knowledge resources. Openness-trust is found to positively influence use of human-knowledge resources and organizational domain-knowledge resources.", "authors": ["Mohammed Ibrahim", "Pieter M. A.

{"abstract": "This paper highlights the importance of design expertise, for designing liquid retaining structures, including subjective judgments and professional experience. Design of liquid retaining structures has special features different from the others. Being more vulnerable to corrosion problem, they have stringent requirements against serviceability limit state of crack. It is the premise of the study to transferring expert knowledge in a computerized blackboard system. Hybrid knowledge representation schemes, including production rules, object-oriented programming, and procedural methods, are employed to express engineering heuristics and standard design knowledge during the development of the knowledge-based system (KBS) for design of liquid retaining structures. This approach renders it possible to take advantages of the characteristics of each method. The system can provide the user with advice on preliminary design, loading specification, optimized configuration selection and detailed design analysis of liquid retaining structure. It would be beneficial to the field of retaining structure design by focusing on the acquisition and organization of expert knowledge through the development of recent artificial intelligence technology.

This study provides an anatomical analysis of today's standard Chinese input process, which is based on pinyin, a phonetic spelling system in Roman characters. Through a combination of human performance modeling and experimentation, our study decomposed the Chinese input process into sub-tasks and found that choice reaction time and numeric keying, two component resulted from the large number of homophones in Chinese, were the major usability bottlenecks. Choice reaction alone took 36% of the total input time in our experiment. Numeric keying for multiple candidates selection tends to take the user's attention away from the computer visual screen. We designed and implemented the EASE (Eye Assisted  Selection and Entry) system to help maintaining  complete touch-typing experience without diverting visual (spacebar) and implicit eye-tracking to replace the numeric keystrokes.

{"abstract": "Many standard image processing operations can be implemented using quadtrees as a simple tree traversal where, at each terminal node, a computation is performed involving some of that node's neighbors. Most of this work has involved the use of bottom-up neighbor-finding techniques which search for a nearest common ancestor. Recently, top-down techniques have been proposed which make use of a neighbor vector as the tree is traversed. A simplified version of the top-down method for a quadtree in the context of a general-purpose tree traversal algorithm is presented. It differs, in part, from prior work in its ability to compute diagonally adjacent neighbors rather than just horizontally and vertically adjacent neighbors. It builds a neighbor vector for each node using a minimal amount of information. Analysis of the algorithm shows that its execution time is directly proportional to the number of nodes in the tree. However, it does require some extra storage. Use of the algorithm leads to lower execution time bounds for some common quadtree image processing operations such as connected component labeling.", "authors": ["Hanan Samet"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["0b6e432c-a7ca-4a27-9dfd-eb5590f5eddf", "0dd155ac-1867-4e23-ad51-df42d3a4efa7", "2baf695f-1328-4c45-9e44-719126088874", "66db0269-15f6-41c3-aa10-617bbcc18b0d", "6dd6796a-dae9-45ad-b06c-1d2cfafc7680", "7dc3e114-fb58-4547-8e86-d4e9c95f1229", "7f6ce07a-7d2d-433a-827f-70886d9ebcd8", "97f1db6e-50d3-4180-a26d-95076759188f", "a8c76816-3583-47e8-98e1-18db34cb5b67", "e1f8c339-b8b1-4dc9-95bd-19ae983c6117", "fd1346fc-9641-4a60-9b3f-8130841df119"], "title": "A Top-Down Quadtree Traversal Algorithm", "venue": "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence", "year": 1985, "id": "e751a73f-f43e-4e1b-a5e5-60c06ffd4e7a"}
{"abstract": "Pervasive computing systems are interactive systems in the large, whose behaviour must adapt to the user's changing tasks and environment using different interface modalities and devices. Since the system adapts to its changing environment, it is vital that there are close links between the structure of the environment and the corresponding structured behavioural changes. We conjecture that predictability in pervasive computing arises from having a close, structured and easily-grasped relationship between the context and the behavioural change that context engenders. In current systems this relationship is not explicitly articulated but instead exists implicitly in the system's reaction to events. Our aim is to capture the relationship in a way that can be used to both analyse pervasive computing systems and aid their design. Moreover, some applications will have a wide range of behaviours; others will vary less, or more subtly. The point is not so much what a system does as how what it does varies with context.

{"abstract": "We analyze walking people using a gait sequence representation that bypasses the need for frame-to-frame tracking of body parts. The gait representation maps a video sequence of silhouettes into a pair of two-dimensional spatio-temporal patterns that are near-periodic along the time axis. Mathematically, such patterns are called \"frieze\" patterns and associated symmetry groups \"frieze groups\". With the help of a walking humanoid avatar, we explore variation in gait frieze patterns with respect to viewing angle, and find that the frieze groups of the gait patterns and their canonical tiles enable us to estimate viewing direction of human walking videos. In addition, analysis of periodic patterns allows us to determine the dynamic time warping and affine scaling that aligns two gait sequences from similar viewpoints. We also show how gait alignment can be used to perform human identification and model-based body part segmentation.", "authors": ["Yanxi Liu", "Robert T.

{"abstract": "This paper introduces a scheme, which we call the baseline method, to define a measure of term representativeness and measures defined by using the scheme. The representativeness of a term is measured by a normalized characteristic value defined for a set of all documents that contain the term. Normalization is done by comparing the original characteristic value with the characteristic value defined for a randomly chosen document set of the same size. The latter value is estimated by a baseline function obtained by random sampling and logarithmic linear approximation. We found that the distance between the word distribution in a document set and the word distribution in a whole corpus is an effective characteristic value to use for the baseline method. Measures defined by the baseline method have several advantages including that they can be used to compare the representativeness of two terms with very different frequencies, and that they have well-defined threshold values of being representative. In addition, the baseline function for a corpus is robust against differences in corpora; that is, it can be used for normalization in a different corpus that has a different size or is in a different domain.", "authors": ["Toru Hisamitsu", "Yoshiki Niwa", "Jun'ichi Tsujii"], "n_citation": 50, "references": ["35cb2b64-7bb6-4c19-a436-2bc0d64f56e0", "46b72748-859f-41ca-8679-2c6430de8f76", "5561130c-0483-4c39-b528-8a418779e16e", "71db93c6-e9c1-4a16-a710-c2c80a8e75dc", "9f265423-e4a7-4340-bb80-3e905e0a809c", "a768a676-fff6-4c1e-8164-2e072789019a"], "title": "A method of measuring term representativeness: baseline method using co-occurrence distribution", "venue": "international conference on computational linguistics", "year": 2000, "id": "20c29d20-7503-4502-8714-fe86168fa4ba"}

{"abstract": "Since the introduction of virtual memory demand-paging and cache memories, computer systems have been exploiting spatial and temporal locality to reduce the average latency of a memory reference. In this paper, we introduce the notion of  value locality,  a third facet of locality that is frequently present in real-world programs, and describe how to effectively capture and exploit it in order to perform  load value prediction.  Temporal and spatial locality are attributes of storage locations, and describe the future likelihood of references to those locations or their close neighbors. In a similar vein,  value locality  describes the likelihood of the recurrence of a previously-seen value within a storage location. Modern processors already exploit  value locality  in a very restricted sense through the use of control speculation (i.e. branch prediction), which seeks to predict the future value of a single condition bit based on previously-seen values. Our work extends this to predict entire 32- and 64-bit register values based on previously-seen values. We find that, just as condition bits are fairly predictable on a per-static-branch basis, full register values being loaded from memory are frequently predictable as well. Furthermore, we show that simple microarchitectural enhancements to two modern microprocessor implementations (based on the PowerPC 620 and Alpha 21164) that enable  load value prediction  can effectively exploit  value locality  to collapse true dependencies, reduce average memory latency and bandwidth requirements, and provide measurable performance gains.", "authors": ["Mikko H.

{"abstract": "Our work focuses on the design of interaction techniques for large information spaces. Our goal is not to define yet another visualization technique but to provide insights for the design of such techniques. Our design approach is based on ergonomic criteria that arose from a study of how the user perceives and manipulates a large information space. We then provide design rules that should help the designer in devising an interaction technique that verifies the ergonomic criteria. After the design of the interaction technique, the next step is software design. We establish links between our design rules/ergonomic criteria and the software architecture model. By applying our PAC-Amodeus model, we show how the software architecture model helps to either verify or assess the ergonomic criteria. We therefore adopt a predictive evaluation approach to the design of interaction techniques for large information spaces. We illustrate our design approach and results through our VITESSE system.", "authors": ["Laurence Nigay", "Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Vernier"], "n_citation": 49, "references": ["03b26fb8-1e09-4737-bbd5-266c661581b3", "13ea1d5f-46bc-4af2-8808-1f82def460b6", "21d565d9-ae5b-47bb-af8a-2a0fd763dd7f", "27be9338-5b09-4f43-848a-78fe3413d6c0", "2f30afea-55f0-4c72-964a-d468632fa39a", "3103d530-8cf8-4c4e-a631-3f56ce96b9d1", "38e0c2d9-0c07-4e61-b5bf-32726a506f92", "4879043d-e7e3-436b-a7f9-e9ced8717bf0", "5787a8fe-24f7-4d50-b271-9521111ba9f0", "8cc99bcc-26dc-4b98-9413-be102f5e5c80", "8e34b9ea-e947-41f3-a097-5964b058bdc8", "9d9623b0-b1cb-48d6-aee1-7e6800a8f616", "a7ed8feb-8f9c-43af-96f8-ba92d77c9006", "edd626a7-c5a9-42c1-a93e-b3560f04f61a"], "title": "Design method of interaction techniques for large information spaces", "venue": "advanced visual interfaces", "year": 1998, "id": "8109da99-d82f-4c2e-82ed-30c07650d35a"}
{"abstract": "Identification of switched linear systems has received considerable attention during the past few years. Since the problem is generically NP-Hard, the majority of existing algorithms are based on heuristics or relaxations. Therefore, it is crucial to check the validity of the identified models against additional experimental data. This paper addresses the problem of model (in)validation for multi-input multi-output switched affine autoregressive exogenous systems with unknown switches. Our main result provides necessary and sufficient conditions for a given model to be (in) validated by the experimental data. In principle, checking these conditions requires solving a sequence of convex optimization problems involving increasingly large matrices. However, as we show in the paper, if in the process of solving these problems either a positive solution is found or the so-called flat extension property holds, then the process terminates with a certificate that either the model has been invalidated or that the experimental data is indeed consistent with the model and a-priori information. By using duality, the proposed approach exploits the inherently sparse structure of the optimization problem to substantially reduce its computational complexity. The effectiveness of the proposed method is illustrated using both academic examples and a non-trivial problem arising in computer vision: activity monitoring.", "authors": ["Necmiye Ozay", "Mario Sznaier", "Constantino M.

{"abstract": "We present a protocol for maintaining a spanning tree that is maximal with respect to any given (bounded and monotonic) routing metric. This protocol has two interesting adaptive properties. First, the protocol is stabilizing: starting from any state, the protocol stabilizes to a state where a maximal tree is present. Second, the protocol is loop-free: starting from any state where a spanning tree is present, the protocol stabilizes, without forming any loops, to a state where a maximal tree is present. The stabilization time of this protocol is O(n deg), where n is the number of nodes, and deg is the node degree in the network.", "authors": ["Jorge Arturo Cobb", "Mohamed G.

{"abstract": "The computation of good, balanced graph colorings is an essential part of many algorithms required in scientific and engineering applications. Motivated by an effective sequential heuristic, we introduce a new parallel heuristic, PLF, and show that this heuristic has the same expected runtime under the PRAM computational model as the scalable coloring heuristic introduced by Jones and Plassmann. We present experimental results performed on the Intel DELTA that demonstrate that this new heuristic consistently generates better colorings and requires only slightly more time than the JP heuristic. In the second part of the paper we introduce two new parallel color-balancing heuristics, PDR(k) and PLF(k). We show that these heuristics have the desirable property that they do not increase the number of colors used by an initial coloring during the balancing process. We present experimental results that show that these heuristics are very effective in obtaining balanced colorings and, in addition, exhibit scalable performance.", "authors": ["Robert K.
